# Practical Applications in Machine Learning: Final Project
## Detecting Fake News & Article Sentiment

The use of generative AI combined with an era of mis/disinformation make the ability for humans to discern between real and fake news increasingly difficult. By creating an application that predicts whether articles are real or fake, we aim to help news readers be more informed about current events and to increase trust in reputable news sources. 

Dataset: Fake and Real News Dataset (Kaggle), 21192 articles
Original Datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset?resource=download
Columns: title, article, subject, date
Date: 12/2015 - 12/2016
Real and fake news labels included for article classification

Models for classification and sentiment analysis:
- Logistic Regression: Simpler algorithm good for binary classification problems such as fake or real news
- Random Forest: Less prone to variance and overfitting and is less sensitive to irrelevant data which can be helpful when working with text
- SVM: Less prone to overfitting and works well in binary classification problems
- Naive Bayes: Can handle larger datasets efficiently and is useful in text classification problems
