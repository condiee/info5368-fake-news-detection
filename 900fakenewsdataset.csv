 Trump Campaign Manager Gives SICKENING Interview On ‘Enormous Sacrifices’ Trump Made (VIDEO),"It wasn t too long ago that Republican nominee Donald Trump made us feel sick to our stomach when he told Gold Star parent Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim soldier that was killed defending this country, that he had  made a lot of sacrifices. It was a disgusting claim, as few people have been as entitled as Trump   but his campaign is back at it again, trying to depict Trump as someone who has actually worked hard.On Thursday, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway insisted that the reason people were voting for Trump was because they appreciated all of the sacrifices he made by running for the White House. In a completely delusional interview with CNN s Chris Cuomo, Conway said: Donald Trump is closing with a positive message. He s talking about his love for the country, his love for the people, what he s going to do to help them solve everyday problems. And Hillary Clinton, unfortunately, has gone lower and lower. They re going totally negative. Obviously, the Trump campaign is now ignoring the fact that its entire campaign strategy has been negative, hateful and divisive. Conway s next statement was even more ridiculous, because Trump has tanked horribly with female voters and shown that he has zero respect for them throughout his entire life. Female voters especially don t like that. They feel they deserve and should be respected to have a substantive conversation. Conway called Trump, who has scammed and insulted more people than we can count throughout his campaign,  incredibly gracious and really funny. And he s doing this for all the right reasons. I mean, I think people will look back at this campaign   particularly after he wins on Tuesday   and they ll say, we totally missed how much America just appreciated  how much America appreciated the fact that he and his family made enormous sacrifices to run for president. Really,  enormous sacrifices?  This statement is just as sickening as when Trump mentions that  small  loan of one million dollars that his father gave him as he whines about how hard his life has been as a wealthy white male. Trump and his family basically had riches handed to them, and they haven t used it to do good. Even Trump s charities have failed to give back as much as Trump says they have.Considering she d already made so many false statements, Conway decided to go for the gold when she trashed Clinton and the Democratic Party. She said: I mean, this is not the Democratic Party that you and I grew up in, Chris. It has gone so far to the left, I can t even reach my hand out and touch it. Cuomo deserves an award for keeping a straight face through this. You can watch Conway in action below:Featured image is a screenshot",News,"November 3, 2016",1
Anti-nuclear campaign group wins 2017 Nobel Peace Prize,"OSLO/GENEVA (Reuters) - A campaign group seeking a global ban on nuclear arms won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, given the award by a Nobel Committee that cited the spread of weapons to North Korea and said the risk was growing of nuclear war. The award to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) was unexpected, particularly in a year when the architects of the 2015 nuclear deal between world powers and Iran had been seen as favorites for achieving the sort of diplomatic breakthrough that has won the prize in the past. (Graphics on 'Nobel Laureates' - here) Supporters described the award as a potential breakthrough for a global movement that has fought to ban nuclear arms from the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in August 1945. ICAN s Executive Director Beatrice Fihn told Reuters the group was elated.  This. Is. Surreal.  she later tweeted. Asked if she had a message for North Korea s Kim Jong-Un, who has tested nuclear arms in defiance of global pressure, and President Donald Trump, who has threatened to  totally destroy  North Korea to protect the United States and its allies, Fihn said both leaders need to know that the weapons are illegal.  Nuclear weapons are illegal. Threatening to use nuclear weapons is illegal. Having nuclear weapons, possessing nuclear weapons, developing nuclear weapons, is illegal, and they need to stop,  she told Reuters.  Two days before her group won the prize, Fihn had tweeted that Trump was  a moron . She told Reuters she had written this in jest, in the context of news reports that U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had used the same word to describe his boss. But she said Trump s impulsive character illustrated the importance of banning nuclear arms for all countries.  A man you can bait with a tweet seems to be taking irrational decisions very quickly and not listening to expertise, it just puts a spotlight on what do nuclear weapons really mean. There are no right hands for the wrong weapons,  she said. ICAN describes itself as a coalition of grassroots non-government groups in more than 100 nations. It began in Australia and was officially launched in Vienna in 2007. In her speech announcing the prize, Berit Reiss-Andersen, the leader of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said the risk that nuclear weapons might be used was now  greater than it has been for a long time .  Some states are modernizing their nuclear arsenals, and there is a real danger that more countries will try to procure nuclear weapons, as exemplified by North Korea.  The award was hailed by anti-nuclear campaigners around the world.  Now more than ever we need a world without nuclear weapons,  United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres tweeted. Mikiso Iwasa, an 88-year-old Hiroshima survivor, told Reuters the prize would help push the movement forward.  It is wonderful we have this Nobel Peace-Prize winning movement. All of us need to join forces, think hard and walk forward together to turn this momentum into something even bigger,  he said. The prize seeks to bolster the case for disarmament amid nuclear tensions between Washington and Pyongyang, as well as uncertainty over the fate of the 2015 deal between Iran and major powers to limit Tehran s nuclear program. The prize-giving committee made no mention of Iran in its award citation. It raised eyebrows with its decision to award the prize to an international campaign group with a relatively low profile, rather than recognize the Iran deal, a complex agreement hammered out over years of high-stakes diplomacy.  Norwegian Nobel Committee has its own ways, but the nuclear agreement with Iran achieved something real and would have deserved a prize,  tweeted Carl Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister who has held top posts as an international diplomat. The Iran accord, which Trump has repeatedly called  the worst deal ever negotiated , is seen as under particular threat this week. A senior administration official said on Thursday Trump is expected to  decertify  the pact, a step which could allow Congress to restore sanctions on Iran. The committee may have been reluctant to reward the Iranian government for its role in the nuclear deal because the only Iranian winner so far, 2003 laureate Shirin Ebadi, a lawyer and human rights campaigner, is forced to live in exile.  I think the committee has thought about the human rights situation in Iran. It would have been difficult to explain the prize even though it has a favorable view of the Iran deal,  Asle Sveen, a historian of the Nobel Peace Prize, told Reuters.  The Norwegian Nobel Committee denied that giving the prize to an anti-nuclear group was intended either as a rebuke to Trump, or as a snub to the architects of the Iran nuclear deal.  The Iran treaty is a positive development, a disarmament development that is positive, but the reason we mentioned North Korea (in our statement) is a reference to the threat that people actually feel,  Reiss-Andersen told Reuters.  Iran has not voiced recent threats to use nuclear weapons.  ICAN has campaigned for a U.N. Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which was adopted by 122 nations in July this year. That agreement is not signed by   and would not apply to   any of the states that already have nuclear arms, which include the five U.N. Security Council permanent members, the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France, as well as India, Pakistan and North Korea. Israel is also widely assumed to have nuclear weapons, although it neither confirms nor denies it. Major allies of the declared nuclear powers also oppose the new treaty. Nevertheless, campaigners see it as a framework that would make it easier for countries that have nuclear arms to work toward eliminating them. NATO member Norway congratulated ICAN but said it would not sign the treaty to ban nuclear weapons. The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded by a committee appointed by the Norwegian parliament.  Norway will not support proposals in the UN that would weaken NATO s role as a defence alliance,  Prime Minister Erna Solberg said. Nuclear-armed nations, including the United States and Russia, back the U.N. s 1968 nuclear non-proliferation treaty which sets limits on the spread of atomic weapons and has a long-term goal of nuclear disarmament.  There is a strong logic in this peace prize,  said Dan Smith, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute  It s all about encouraging governments to do what they have promised to do in the non-proliferation treaty.

France's Macron calls on Iraq to dismantle all militias,"PARIS/BAGHDAD (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday called on Iraq to dismantle all militias, including the government-sanctioned, Iran-backed Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), a rare public call to do so by a major Western leader. Macron s call, which followed a meeting with Iraqi Kurdish leaders in Paris, underscores the tough balancing act Baghdad has to perform between its allies in the war on Islamic State, Iran and Western powers, which do not see eye to eye.  It is essential that there is a gradual demilitarisation, in particular of the Popular Mobilisation that established itself in the last few years in Iraq, and that all militias be gradually dismantled,  he told a Paris news conference held with Iraqi Kurdish leaders. Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) authorities accuse the majority Arab Shi ite PMF of widespread abuses against Kurds in Iraq s ethnically mixed regions. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi s government denies that the PMF are engaged in a systematic pattern of abuses and has pledged to punish anyone proven guilty of violations. Disarming the PMF is seen as Abadi s most difficult test as his forces edge closer to declaring victory over Islamic State. In Baghdad, Abadi s office released a statement later saying he had spoken to Macron by phone and that the French president had affirmed his country s commitment to a unified Iraq. It made no mention of Macron s call to dismantle the militias. Iraqi Vice President Nuri al-Maliki, a former prime minister who was pressured to leave office by both the U.S. and Iran for failing to stop Islamic State, was more forceful. Macron, he said, was carrying out  unacceptable interference  in Iraq s internal affairs.  These positions from France are absolutely rejected and harm Iraq s sovereignty and its institutions,  Maliki said in a statement. Macron s meeting with KRG Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani and his deputy Qubad Talabani was the first high-profile international meeting for the Kurdish leadership after a Sept. 25 independence referendum. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and British Prime Minister Theresa May have both made trips to Iraq after the referendum but only met officials in Baghdad and made no visits to the KRG capital Erbil. Western powers had encouraged the Kurds not to hold the referendum and instead engage in dialogue with Baghdad. Macron again called for dialogue between the central government in Baghdad and the semi-autonomous KRG within the framework of the Iraqi constitution, saying he was convinced a  constructive dialogue  could lead to lifting Baghdad s restrictions on the Kurdish region. Kurds voted to break away from Iraq in the referendum, defying the government in Baghdad and alarming neighboring Turkey and Iran who have their own Kurdish minorities. The Iraqi government responded by seizing the Kurdish-held city of Kirkuk and other territory disputed between the Kurds and the central government. Long-serving Kurdish president Masoud Barzani stepped down over the affair and the regional government led by his nephew Nechirvan has tried to negotiate an end to the confrontation. The Kurdish prime minister said on Saturday he saw France playing a role to end the dispute with Baghdad and that his government respected a verdict by the Iraqi Supreme Federal Court ruling the referendum unconstitutional and its results void.  With regards to the referendum, we are in a new era, and this issue is over and we have made our position in the Kurdistan Regional Government clear,  Erbil-based broadcaster Rudaw quoted Barzani as saying. Macron called for the long-delayed implementation of Article 140 of the Iraqi constitution to settle the status of territories disputed between Baghdad and the Kurds. Article 140 provided for a referendum to be held by the end of 2007 in the oil region of Kirkuk and other territories claimed by both the KRG and the Iraqi government to determine whether their populations wanted to be part of the Kurdish region or not. No such referendum took place, among the reasons cited by the KRG to unilaterally hold its referendum on independence.  ",worldnews,"December 2, 2017 ",0
STARVE YOUR CHILDREN OR ELSE: Punishment From Feds If Michelle Obama’s Food Plan Not Followed,"You ve probably seen the disgusting photos of the official school lunch that s now given to your children. It s pretty bad so we hope you make lunch for your kids. We could post example after example of the skimpy and unappetizing lunch that the new lunch program is forcing on kids.  Hunger-Free-Kids  is the name of the program but from all reports we ve heard the kids are starving and not getting enough food. so now the government is going to  punish  schools for not starving their kids? Liberal lunacy!The federal government is taking steps to fine schools that do not comply with first lady Michelle Obama s school lunch rules.The U.S. Department of Agriculture s Food and Nutrition Service issued a proposed rule Monday to codify parts of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, which was championed by Mrs. Obama.The regulation would punish schools and state departments with fines for  egregious or persistent disregard  for the lunch rules that imposed sodium and calorie limits and banned white grains.A West Virginia preschool teacher was threatened with fines for violating the rules by rewarding her students with candy for good behavior in June 2015. The teacher ultimately did not have to pay, but the school had to develop a  corrective action plan  with training on the policies.The government now seeks to make fines enforceable by regulation. Section 303 of the law requires that the federal government  establish criteria for the imposition of fines  for all the Department of Agriculture s child food programs. Under section 303, the Secretary or a State agency may establish an assessment against any school food authority or school administering the Child Nutrition Programs if the Secretary or the State agency determines that the school or school food authority failed to correct severe mismanagement of any program, failed to correct repeated violations of program requirements, or disregarded a requirement of which they have been informed,  the proposed rule states.The government insisted that fines would be limited only to schools, school food authorities, and state agencies that have  failed to correct severe mismanagement of any program, disregarded a requirement of which it has been informed, or failed to correct repeated violations of program requirements. It is important to note that the statutory scheme only anticipates assessments be established in instances of severe mismanagement of a program, disregard of a program requirement of which the program operator had been informed, or failure to correct repeated violations [emphasis in original],  according to the proposed regulation.  These criteria suggest that violations that would result in assessments would be egregious or persistent in nature, remaining unresolved after the normal monitoring and oversight activities have failed to secure corrective action.

South Korea to 'wait and see' after Trump threat to scrap free trade deal,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea is adopting a “wait and see” stance, government officials said on Friday, after U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters he would “renegotiate or terminate” a free trade pact between the two countries.  The won KRW= turned lower against the dollar soon after Trump's comments, trading down 0.2 percent at 1,132.5 to the dollar. South Korea's benchmark share index .KS11 fell, wiping out earlier gains, to stand down 0.03 percent at 2,208.73 points by 0207 GMT (10:07 p.m. ET).     “Talk and actual policy are different,” a high-ranking official at the finance ministry, who declined to be named, as he was not authorized to speak to the media, told Reuters. “They have not requested anything from us so we’ll have to wait and see.”     He reiterated comments by Finance Minister Yoo Il-ho the previous day that South Korea had not yet received any official requests on the renegotiation of the pact, which took effect in 2012. The deal was great for South Korea, but “terrible” for the United States, Trump told Reuters in the interview. A senior trade official also told Reuters the ministry would need to coordinate with Washington on the trade deal, but declined to elaborate further, as he needed time to look into the matter. South Korea’s automobile industry body expressed concern over the possible revision of the trade deal. Shares of Hyundai Motor (005380.KS) extended losses, and were down as much as 2.4 percent after Trump’s comments. ",politicsNews,"April 28, 2017 ",0

Kubek accused the children of destroying his sign despite the fact that he never actually witnessed them doing it. The children denied any involvement, and the officers told Kubek to return to his house so they could speak to the children.According to the kids, they were simply on their way to the park for a birthday celebration when Kubek had pulled out a gun and pointed it at them, instructing them to sit down on the grass.

CIA Report Released: Trump maintains DNC Leaks had “Absolutely no effect on outcome of election”,"21st Century Wire says Despite the mass media distraction of the improbably  Active Shooter  attack at Fort Lauderdale Airport earlier this afternoon   today was  the big day,  the dramatic release of the  unclassified  portion the US Intelligence report of the alleged Russian Hack  of the 2016 US Election. Meanwhile, at Trump Tower, President-Elect Donald Trump was given the full classified version of the report today, and was unimpressed, declaring that the alleged hacking of the Democrat National Committee (DNC) had  absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election. Note that it is still an  alleged  hack because US intelligence agencies Have yet to produce any actual evidence that the Russian government were involved in either the DNC Leaks or the Podesta Email dump on Wikileaks.Instead, the report s main thrust is accusing the Russians of running all of the so-called  fake news  articles that flooded Facebook and social media during the 2016 election cycle   claiming that it all traces back to St. Petersburg, Russia   despite earlier investigative reports published by both The Guardian and Buzzfeed which placed the fake news empire in Macedonia, where teenagers netted small fortunes by pumping out imaginary stories on hundreds of cut-out websites during the 2016 election.  Putin Aspired to Help Trump CNN and other US media outlets were quick to  down-shift  their headlines   away from saying that the Russian government  Hacked  the US Elections, now saying that  Putin Aspired to Help Trump. After a 90-minute briefing at Trump Tower with national intelligence chiefs,  Donald Trump, under pressure from his party and the US media, issued a statement seeming to acknowledge some hacking of  the cyber-infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee,  but was clear to ad the caveat that whatever happened had  absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election. While Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber-infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines. There were attempts to hack the Republican National Committee, but the R.N.C. had strong hacking defenses and the hackers were unsuccessful.

U Of WI STUDENTS SELL Hateful Hoodies: “All White People Are Racists”…Message Promoting Violence Against Cops,"University of Wisconsin Madison, where NOT to send your kids to school The sale of hateful racist sweatshirts or hoodies on campus is really not surprising considering the University of WI Madison has been a hotbed for radical students and faculty for quite some time now. We shared a story about a U of WI Madison student who was given cover by his professor when the police came to talk to him during class after he was caught on camera spray painting racist graffiti all over school property.  Students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are asking people to buy sweatshirts promoting violence against police officers and classifying all white people as racists. Racism,  claims one hoodie s page,  is a set of systematic, institutional, cultural, and epistemological (although not limited to said forms) structures that inherently empowers white folk and in turn disempowers people of color. This power dictates who lives, have housing, access to education/healthcare etc. Racism has little to do with hatred and mostly to do with who has power. White folk or those who see themselves as white are given said power inherently regardless of socioeconomic class, education etc. This is why white men created race in the first place to maintain power. Racism gave birth to the idea of race. This is a [sic] oversimplified definition,  the description continues.Facebook has already removed an original picture of the sweatshirt for not following Facebook s Community Standards. However, as of this writing, Facebook has yet to remove the post selling the sweatshirts.One of the sweatshirt says  If I Encounter Another Cop With A God Complex I m Going To Have To Show The World That They Are Human , seemingly promoting violence towards police.Via: Campus Reform",left-news,"Oct 6, 2016",1
Voters in Maine approve expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare,"(Reuters) - Voters in Maine on Tuesday approved a ballot initiative to expand the state’s Medicaid program under Obamacare, sending a clear signal of support for the federal healthcare law to lawmakers in the state and Washington D.C.   The approval of the ballot question in Maine comes after Republicans in Washington failed several times over the last few months to pass legislation that would dismantle the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law. Maine has recently figured prominently in the nation’s debate on how to reform healthcare. U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, helped block her party’s efforts to repeal Obamacare this year, which angered President Donald Trump.  Maine, which becomes the first U.S. state to approve Medicaid expansion by ballot initiative, is one of 19 states that has not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.  About 60 percent of voters in Maine approved the ballot initiative, according to the Bangor Daily News newspaper.   Tuesday’s ballot asked Maine voters to approve or reject a plan to provide healthcare coverage under Medicaid for adults under the age of 65 with incomes at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which in 2017 is about $16,000 for a single person and about $22,000 for a family of two.  The state’s Republican governor, Paul LePage, staunchly opposes expansion of federal health care insurance, vetoing legislation to do so on several occasions.   “I’ve said it before, “free” is very expensive to somebody,” LePage said in a radio address last week.   About 70,000 residents in Maine would be eligible for the state’s Medicaid program when and if state officials certify the results of the election. Lawmakers could vote to repeal or alter the referendum, much like they have recently for several citizen-initiated referendums, the Bangor Daily News reported.   “It is now the responsibility and the duty of the governor and the legislature to fully and faithfully implement this law,” the state’s Speaker of the House, Sara Gideon, said in a statement.  The Legislature’s Office of Fiscal and Program Review in Maine estimated that expansion of Medicaid would cost the state about $55 million and bring in about $525 million of federal money to the state each year, according to the Bangor Daily News.

Democrats raise doubts about Trump's high court nominee Gorsuch,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump’s U.S. Supreme Court nominee, on Monday emphasized the need for judicial independence even as Trump castigates jurists who have ruled against him, while Democrats questioned whether he would rule against abortion rights and gun control while favoring corporations. With the ideological balance of the Supreme Court at stake, the Senate Judiciary Committee opened its confirmation hearing for Gorsuch, a conservative federal appeals court judge from Colorado. Republicans praised Gorsuch, 49, as highly qualified for a lifetime appointment as a justice. “I think we’re off to a good start,” Republican Chuck Grassley, the committee’s chairman, said afterward, with senators getting their first shot at questioning Gorsuch on Tuesday. Committee Democrats noted Gorsuch has the chance to join the court only because Senate Republicans last year refused to consider Democratic former President Barack Obama’s nomination of federal appellate judge Merrick Garland. Despite slim chances of blocking his nomination in the Republican-led Senate, Democrats raised questions about Gorsuch’s suitability for the job. “Our job is to determine whether Judge Gorsuch is a reasonable, mainstream conservative or is he not,” said the panel’s top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein. Speaking publicly for the first time since Trump nominated him on Jan. 31, Gorsuch defended his judicial record in the face of Democratic criticism of his rulings.  Gorsuch, speaking mostly in generalities that could not cause him any trouble, emphasized the need for “neutral and independent judges to apply the law,” warned against judicial overreach, and referred to “the modest station we judges are meant to occupy in a democracy.” “If judges were just secret legislators, declaring not what the law is but what they would like it to be, the very idea of a government by the people and for the people would be at risk,” Gorsuch said in comments in harmony with conservative criticism of unelected “activist judges.” Gorsuch, a cool-headed and amiable jurist, gave Democrats very little ammunition to use against him, although there could be more drama when he takes questions. The hearing could last four days, providing classic Washington political theater. Grassley said the panel is likely to vote on the nomination on April 3, with the full Senate vote likely soon after. If Gorsuch is confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he would restore a narrow 5-4 conservative court majority. The seat has been vacant for 13 months, since the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal underscored the importance of judicial independence at a time when Trump has excoriated federal judges who have ruled against him on matters including two executive orders, put on hold by courts, to block people from several Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States. Blumenthal said it was not “idle speculation” to suggest the Supreme Court might be asked to enforce a subpoena against Trump, citing FBI Director James Comey’s testimony before Congress on Monday confirming an ongoing investigation into alleged collusion between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia.  Republican Ted Cruz said there is no reason for Gorsuch to be questioned about Trump, noting that previous nominees have not had to speak about allegations made against the president who nominated them. Democrats highlighted cases on which Gorsuch has ruled and questioned the influence of conservative interest groups in advising Trump on his selection. Feinstein emphasized abortion. Conservatives have long opposed the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion nationwide. Feinstein called that ruling and others since then buttressing abortion rights “super precedents” deserving special deference. Feinstein cited two Gorsuch legal opinions in which she said he “argued in favor of making it harder to convict felons who possess guns.” Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy said he was worried that Gorsuch’s conservative method of interpreting the Constitution “goes beyond being a philosophy and becomes an agenda” that is anti-abortion, anti-environment and pro-business. “Will you allow the government to intrude on Americans’ personal privacy and freedoms? Will you elevate the rights of corporations over those of real people? Will you rubberstamp a president whose administration has asserted that executive power is not subject to judicial review?” Leahy said. Many Democrats contend Trump’s party “stole” a Supreme Court seat by freezing out Garland. “Your nomination is part of a Republican strategy to capture our judicial branch of government,” Senator Dick Durbin told Gorsuch. “That is why the Senate Republicans kept this Supreme Court seat vacant for more than a year and why they left 30 judicial nominees who had received bipartisan approval of this committee to die on the Senate calendar as President Obama left office.” Gorsuch said he has tried to treat all who come to court fairly and with respect. “I have decided cases for Native Americans seeking to protect tribal lands, for class actions like one that ensured compensation for victims of nuclear waste pollution by corporations in Colorado,” he said. He also said he has ruled for disabled students, prisoners and workers alleging civil rights violations, and for immigrants who entered the country illegally. The court’s ideological leaning could help determine the outcome of cases involving the death penalty, abortion, gun control, environmental regulations, transgender rights, voting rights, immigration, religious liberty, presidential powers and more. Republicans hold 52 of the Senate’s 100 seats. Under present rules, Gorsuch would need 60 votes to secure confirmation. If Gorsuch cannot muster 60, Republicans could change the rules to allow confirmation by a simple majority. ",politicsNews,"March 19, 2017 ",0
 WATCH: Bill Maher Doesn’t Hold Back Defending Bernie Sanders On Foreign Policy,"During a segment of Real Time with Bill Maher, the comedic host went all out in his defense of Bernie Sanders  foreign policy experience.During the segment, the lefties at the table agreed that Sanders is excellent on economic issues. Though some seemed skeptical that Sanders has the same grasp of foreign policy issues.  Maher was asked by MSNBC s Alex Wagner if he seriously thinks that Sanders is fit to lead the nation as president when it comes to foreign policy matters. Wagner asks Maher: Do you want Bernie Sanders getting off Air Force One, making a deal on foreign police with ? Do you think he s at the level that we need? Maher responds to Wagner s question, saying: Fuck yeah! The guy who voted right on the Iraq war? Yea, I do. Then, Armstrong Williams, an advisor for Ben Carson, decided to chime in. Williams implies that it doesn t actually matter how well Sanders knows foreign policy. That s because Sanders would be surrounded by experts.Maher says that might be good enough for Carson, who once repeatedly and publicly referred to Hamas, as  Hummus.  Maher recounts the time that Carson said that we need to build a coalition of Arab nations, in order to combat the Islamic State. When asked what nations he would have been a part of this coalition, Carson couldn t name a single nation.The idea that Sanders wouldn t be strong on foreign policy issues is ridiculous. Both Hillary Clinton and Sanders, have not been extremely illustrative about their views on foreign policy. That might have to do with the fact that Democrats are not that passionate about foreign policy issues this election cycle. There may be a few areas where the two candidates diverge, though, they both seem to mainly differentiate themselves by tone on issues like the Islamic State.You can watch the segment from the show, below.https://youtu.be/62YiMIGmAdc?t=4s Featured image from video screenshot via YouTube.",News,"February 6, 2016",1
(VIDEO) OBAMA ON LETTERMAN: “WE IGNORE POCKETS OF POVERTY” BUT OBAMA’S STIMULUS GAVE $1.8 BILLION TO BALTIMORE,"The stats don t lie on this one Obama s hoping to reach the low information voter who watches Letterman and will buy this bs. The stimulus under Obama gave BILLIONS for work programs and education but we still need to give more??? As a taxpaying American I am 100% FED Up! and ready for the black community to take responsibility for their towns and their youth. We DO NOT ignore pockets of poverty but I would say that we ignore the truth of what s going on in the black community and what s the real problem here. It s just like when the main stream media ignores and covers up the bad behavior of groups of black teens. We ve reported on numerous cases of this bad behavior that caused damage and physical harm to others. The latest case was ironically in Baltimore and the local press called the offenders  kids  when you can see clearly that these are teens. Downplaying and not punishing the bad behavior by these teens only makes it worse. No consequences breeds chaos President Obama said that  too often we ignore   pockets of poverty, lack of opportunity, lack of education  on Monday s  Late Show  on CBS.Obama said,  it s important that now that charges have been brought in Baltimore, that we let due process play itself out. Those officers who have been charged, they deserve, to be represented, and to let the legal system work its way through. We don t have all the facts yet, and that that s going to be presented in a court of law. I think it s also really important to remember that the overwhelming number of police officers are doing an outstanding job, we re in New York, today,   we re in New York today, where a young officer lost his life doing his job, and families of officers all across the country every day, they re wondering  is my loved one going to come home?  And so they ve got a really tough job. He continued,  what we also know, though, is that for far too long, for decades, you have a situation in which too many communities don t have a relationship of trust with the police, and if you just have a handful of police who are not doing the right thing, that makes the job tougher for all the other police officers out there. It creates an environment in the community where they feel as if, rather than being protected and served, they re the targets of arbitrary arrests or stops, and so our job has to be to rebuild trust, and we put forward a task force made up of police officers, but also young activists who have been protesting in Ferguson, or here in New York. They came up with some terrific recommendations about collecting data on what happens when there s a shooting involving police, what are we doing in terms of things like body cameras, and so there s some very practical, concrete things we can do to make the system work better.

 Perfect Match? Evidence Leans Towards Sarah Palin Endorsing Donald Trump At Iowa Event (IMAGE),"Donald Trump set tongues wagging with a tweet on Monday promising a special guest scheduled to appear with him at campaign event in Iowa on Tuesday, January 19. His campaign announced: He ll be making a major announcement & bringing a special guest. Now, after some sleuthing by some conservatives online, it appears that the guest may be none other than failed Republican presidential candidate and half-term governor Sarah Palin.Eagle-eyed campaign watchers found a flight on a private jet that left Anchorage International Airport, and five hours later touched down at Des Moines International Airport.Since her campaign flameout, Palin has kept her brand alive at the center of conservative politics. She has been a featured speaker at the CPAC conference and regularly has pumped out books targeted at conservative readers. A pay-per-view video venture of hers was less successful and recently shuttered. Palin recently put her gated Arizona mansion up for sale.Palin may be accused by some conservatives of being disloyal to Trump rival Ted Cruz, who she endorsed and campaigned for in the past.But Palin has also been a booster of Donald Trump. Last November she said his nomination was a strong possibility. I think it s a very real possibility because people are really tired of professional politicians who, you know, won t call it like they see it and maybe don t have life experiences that allow them to prove a track record of success,  the former vice presidential nominee said in a radio interview with WBT Charlotte s News Talk radio on Thursday. That s refreshing about Trump,  she said.  He s a fighter. We know he s gonna put America first, and he really nailed it early on what the main problems are in America right now, so it s a very real possibility. In 2011 when there was speculation Palin might challenge President Obama in 2012, she took her bus tour to New York City and had a weird pizza date with Trump and his wife, Melania.While mostly a laughingstock to the public at large, Republican base voters remain enamored with Palin, and may view an endorsement by her of the reality TV star as a signal to select him as their candidate as the Iowa caucus waits only a couple of weeks away.Featured image via YouTube ",News,"January 19, 2016",1

Japan's emperor draws record birthday crowd as he prepares to abdicate,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A record crowd paid their respects to Japan s 84-year-old Emperor Akihito at Tokyo s Imperial Palace on Saturday, in his first birthday celebration since the date of his abdication was set. The emperor s birthday is traditionally marked by a national holiday and an address at the Imperial Palace, which opens to the public on the day. Well-wishers waved small Japanese flags and held up smartphones as Emperor Akihito, whose position is ceremonial with no political power, addressed them from a balcony, flanked by his wife and other members of the imperial family. The crowd of 52,300, according to the Imperial Household Agency, was the largest birthday attendance during Akihito s symbolic 29-year reign, known as the  Heisei  era, which means  achieving peace  in Japanese.  On this day as we face the cold, my thoughts go out to those who suffered from typhoons and heavy rains, as well as the victims of the Great East Japan Earthquake who continue to lead difficult lives,  he said, referring to the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that killed and displaced tens of thousands on the country s eastern seaboard. Along with Empress Michiko, Akihito has spent much of his reign addressing the legacy of World War Two, which was fought in the name of his father, Hirohito, and consoling victims of disasters such as the 2011 earthquake.  Earlier this month, a 10-member Imperial Household Council agreed that Akihito would step down on April 30, 2019, before passing the Chrysanthemum Throne to his eldest son, Crown Prince Naruhito. In comments made to media, Akihito said he would use the remaining days of his reign to carry out his duties and prepare to  pass the torch to the next era.  Akihito has had heart surgery and treatment for prostate cancer and said last year that he feared he would struggle to fulfill his royal duties due to his age. Japan passed a law this year allowing him to step down in a one-off provision as existing law did not provide for abdication. The last time a Japanese emperor abdicated was in 1817. Throughout his reign, Akihito has consistently urged the Japanese never to forget the horrors of war. His conciliatory remarks contrast with gestures made by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has adopted a less apologetic tone over Japan s past military aggression. ",worldnews,"December 23, 2017 ",0
Poll shows improvement in Brazil President Temer's low approval rating,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - The approval rating for Brazilian President Michel Temer s scandal-plagued government has doubled to 6 percent from the prior survey, a new poll published on Wednesday showed, as the country s economy continues to improve. The survey by pollster Ibope, conducted between Dec. 7-10, said the number of people who considered Temer s government  bad  or  terrible  fell to 74 percent, from 77 percent in the previous survey in September. That represents the first improvement in Temer s unfavorable rating since he took over last year from his predecessor Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached for breaking budget rules. Brazil s economy continues to strengthen as it exits its worst recession in a century, posting its third consecutive quarter of growth in the third quarter. The poll comes as Brazil s Congress heads into a winter recess until February without voting to overhaul the pension system, Temer s top policy initiative that is seen as vital to fixing the country s finances but is widely unpopular. The government has notched some smaller legislative successes, including more flexible labor regulations that came into effect last month. In October, the lower house of Congress again rejected corruption charges against Temer. ",worldnews,"December 20, 2017 ",0
Macron opens door to changes in mainland-Corsica relationship,"PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron has said his government could consider changes in the relationship between mainland France and Corsica, which seeks greater autonomy, but ruled out new residency rights or recognition of Corsican as an official language. An alliance of Corsica s two main nationalist parties swept a local election on Dec. 10 and has been pressing for talks with Paris.  Its leaders want more autonomy on fiscal issues, an equal status for the French and Corsican languages, and the limiting of the right to buy property in some areas to people who have been resident on the holiday island for at least five years.  The two-party  Pe a Corsica  (For Corsica) alliance won nearly two thirds of seats in the local assembly election. Support for their cause is driven by dissatisfaction with France s mainstream parties, mirroring a trend that has spurred secessionist ambitions elsewhere in Europe, such as Catalonia.  Looking ahead, we could consider possible changes, and the prime minister has indicated this to Corsica s leaders,  Macron said in an interview published by Spanish daily El Mundo on Wednesday.   But these would come, as elsewhere, within the framework of the constitution. This republican framework does not allow us to say yes to certain demands, such as on residency rights or recognizing Coriscan as the official language alongside French.  Corsica s nationalists are split between those who seek greater autonomy and those who see full independence as the ultimate goal.  Corsica makes up two of France s 101  departments  - local administration areas. Unlike in Catalonia, its nationalists downplay any immediate ambitions for independence, saying the island - where Napoleon was born in 1769 - lacks the Spanish region s demographic and economic clout. While Macron did not say what he might be prepared to negotiate, it is the first time he has touched on the subject since the vote. France is a highly centralized state and Corsica s demands for more autonomy have often been met with irritation and a refusal to negotiate by past governments. ",worldnews,"December 27, 2017 ",0
House Republicans test Trump on his U.S.-Mexico wall,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the House of Representatives hope to offer President-elect Donald Trump an alternate plan to his proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall, a first test by lawmakers from his own party of one of his key campaign promises. Just a day after Trump’s stunning election victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton, congressional aides told Reuters the lawmakers wanted to meet with Trump’s advisers to discuss a less costly option to his “big, beautiful, powerful wall.” The plan would involve more border fencing and additional border staffing with federal agents, many of whom belong to labor unions that supported Trump’s candidacy, the aides said. Double layers of fencing would be extended along parts of the roughly 2,000-mile (3,200-km) border, rather than constructing a brick-and-mortar wall, according to the proposal. A House Republican aide and a Department of Homeland Security official said a wall was not realistic because it would block visibility for border agents and cut through rugged terrain, as well as bodies of water and private land. The House aide said House Republicans working on the alternative plan were waiting for Trump’s transition team to be put in place before setting a date for the meeting. A spokesman for Trump did not respond to a request for comment on the lawmakers’ proposal or their desired meeting.  Mexico said on Wednesday that it would not pay for a border wall, as Trump has pledged. Immigration was a central feature of the Trump campaign, focusing on concerns among some voters about illegal immigrants and perceptions they take jobs and pose security risks.  Before the Republican convention in July, party platform committee members successfully petitioned delegates to add language about the proposed wall to the platform statement.  But U.S. Republican Representative Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, has called a wall along the entire border a “knee-jerk” reaction and has not mentioned the idea in legislation on Capitol Hill.  If Congress stands up to Trump, his wall may end up being a fence extension, said Steve Legomsky, professor emeritus and immigration law expert at Washington University School of Law. “Congress won’t fund the kind of wall Trump promised, and Mexico won’t pay for it. But to save face, President Trump and congressional leaders will likely agree to a modest extension of the existing border fence,” Legomsky predicted. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Wednesday that border security was an important agenda item that he wanted to achieve “in whatever way is the most effective.” The National Border Patrol Council, a union representing border agents, said the agency had already had a difficult time meeting hiring goals mandated by Congress.

"Climate change should not be 'partisan issue,' Kerry says","CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (Reuters) - Work to avert the problems caused by climate change should not be a partisan issue, outgoing Secretary of State John Kerry told students at an elite U.S. engineering school on Monday, in one of his final speeches as the nation’s top diplomat. Kerry noted U.S. officials from military and intelligence leaders to the mayors of coastal cities agree the problem of rising sea levels and erratic rainfall is one that they want to take action on, and he urged the incoming administration of Republican President-elect Donald Trump to tackle head on. Trump, a New York real estate developer who has never held elected office, has described climate change as a hoax and vowed to pull the United States out of the deal negotiated in Paris in 2015 to cut global greenhouse gas emissions. But in an interview with the New York Times in November, Trump said he was keeping an open mind on whether to pull out of the accord. “I’m not going to speculate about the policies that our President-elect and his Secretary of State will choose to pursue, but I will tell you this ... some issues look a lot different when you’re actually in office compared to when you’re on the campaign trail,” Kerry said at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.  “The truth is that climate change shouldn’t be a partisan issue. It’s an issue that all of us should care about, regardless of political affiliation.” The U.S. Senate this week is due to begin the process of confirming Trump’s political appointments, including proposed Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma, who has repeatedly challenged the agency’s authority in the courts. Many Republicans in Congress argue environmental regulations slow business growth and job creation, both expected to be top priorities for the Trump administration. Kerry referenced a U.S. intelligence report published on Monday that listed climate change among the factors that could raise the risk of conflict between nations. Obama on Monday echoed the message in an article published in Science magazine.  Kerry called on researchers and students at MIT to keep up their work on improving energy efficiency and inventing new energy sources, regardless of government policies. “It’s going to be innovators, researchers, entrepreneurs, and business leaders ... who will continue to create the technological advances that forever revolutionize the way we power our world,” Kerry said. “Every person in this room – indeed, every person on the planet – has an interest in making sure that transition happens as quickly as possible.” ",politicsNews,"January 9, 2017 ",0
 Racist GOP Rep. Steve King Goes BALLISTIC Over Trump’s DACA Deal,"This is what happens when racists don t get their way.With a single deal, Donald Trump enraged his racist base, including Iowa GOP Rep. Steve King.On Wednesday, Democrats announced that they had struck a deal with Trump to revive the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program put in place by President Obama to prevent the deportation of 800,000 people who were brought to the United States as children by their undocumented parents.When Trump first scrapped the program, his conservative base cheered while the rest of the nation expressed revulsion.But Trump also left the issue to Congress, thus opening the door for legislative action to save the program. So, Senator Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi offered Trump a deal. DACA will be restored and enshrined in law and Trump will get some enhanced border security that does not include a giant useless expensive wall.Trump took the deal and now conservatives are furious.In fact, Steve King went on CNN to whine about the deal and even threatened Trump with political ruin. The base will leave him   they can t support him anymore. I am talking about my constituents in Iowa that will say you need to be behind trump. I am. I support his entire agenda  I support the agenda Trump had when he went into office and I support almost every piece of the agenda   except the amnesty piece being dangled, and that s so destructive to a first world country. If you do not have the rule of law or respect for that law, the people writing the immigration laws are the people breaking them. We had a protest here, DREAMers coming up demanding we give them amnesty. What right do law breakers have to make demands from the citizens of the United States of America. If anything, they should be pleading for it and not demanding. King also predicted that,  Things are going to be going downhill real fast or the Republicans will be done for 2018 and 2020. Here s the video via YouTube.Amnesty is term used for people who broke the law. These 800,000 people did not break any law. Their parents did. These children had no control over their parents  actions and did not understand that a law was being broken. Therefore, these children should not be forced to go back to a country they know nothing about. America is their home.Furthermore, King is a seriously depraved individual if he thinks these people should have to beg to stay in the country. They did nothing wrong. But King is clearly showing that he lacks compassion and is nothing more than a racist who has no business being a member of Congress.Featured image via screenshot  ",News,"September 14, 2017",1
JUST IN: TRUMP Will Remove “Climate Change” From List Of National Security Threats,"Thank goodness we finally have a President who refuses to dump our taxpayer funds into climate scam that our former President actually identified as a national security threat According to The Federalist, The Trump administration will reverse course from previous Obama administration policy, eliminating climate change from a list of national security threats. The National Security Strategy to be released on Monday will emphasize the importance of balancing energy security with economic development and environmental protection, according to a source who has seen the document and shared excerpts of a late draft. Climate policies will continue to shape the global energy system,  a draft of the National Security Strategy slated to be released on Monday said.  U.S. leadership is indispensable to countering an anti-growth, energy agenda that is detrimental to U.S. economic and energy security interests. Given future global energy demand, much of the developing world will require fossil fuels, as well as other forms of energy, to power their economies and lift their people out of poverty. During his successful campaign, Trump mocked Obama s placement of climate change in the context of national security. Here s a sample of his approach from a campaign speech in Hilton Head, South Carolina, in late 2015:So Obama s always talking about the global warming, that global warming is our biggest and most dangerous problem, OK? No, no, think of it. I mean, even if you re a believer in global warming, ISIS is a big problem, Russia s a problem, China s a problem. We ve got a lot of problems. By the way, the maniac in North Korea is a problem. He actually has nuclear weapons, right? That s a problem.We ve got a lot of problems. We ve got a lot of problems. That s right, we don t win anymore. He said we want to win. We don t win anymore. We re going to win a lot   if I get elected, we re going to win a lot. (Applause)We re going to win so much   we re going to win a lot. We re going to win a lot. We re going to win so much you re all going to get sick and tired of winning. You re going to say oh no, not again. I m only kidding. You never get tired of winning, right? Never. (Applause)But think of it. So Obama s talking about all of this with the global warming and the   a lot of it s a hoax, it s a hoax. I mean, it s a money-making industry, OK? It s a hoax, a lot of it. And look, I want clean air and I want clean water. That s my global   I want clean, clean crystal water and I want clean air. And we can do that, but we don t have to destroy our businesses, we don t have to destroy our  And by the way, China isn t abiding by anything. They re buying all of our coal; we can t use coal anymore essentially. They re buying our coal and they re using it. Now when you talk about the planet, it s so big out there   we re here, they re there, it s like they re our next door neighbor, right, in terms of the universe.The draft of the National Security Strategy makes this approach policy, emphasizing national security and economic growth over climate change.President Obama made climate change, and the burdensome regulations that accompany its focus, a primary focus of his administration, including in his National Security Strategy released in 2015.  [W]e are working toward an ambitious new global climate change agreement to shape standards for prevention, preparedness, and response over the next decade,  that report said.Watch Barack Obama explain how  climate change  is national security threat: By contrast, President Trump s National Security Strategy will focus on conventional and immediate national security risks. The draft says, in part:North Korea seeks the capability to kill millions of Americans with nuclear weapons. Iran supports terrorist groups and openly calls for our destruction. Jihadist terrorist organizations such as ISIS and al Qaeda are determined to attack the United States and radicalize Americans with their hateful ideology. States and non-state actors undermine social order with drug and human trafficking networks, which drive violent crimes and cause thousands of American deaths each year . Strengthening control over our borders and immigration system is central to national security, economic prosperity, and the rule of law. Terrorists, drug traffickers, and criminal cartels exploit porous borders and threaten U.S. security and public safety. These actors adapt quickly to outpace our defenses.As for climate change, the draft report says  The United States will remain a global leader in reducing traditional pollution, as well as greenhouse gases, while growing its economy. This achievement, which can serve as model to other countries, flows from innovation, technology breakthroughs, and energy efficiency gains  not from onerous regulation.

Israel's Sara Netanyahu may face indictment: attorney general,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel s attorney general is considering indicting the wife of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Sara, on suspicion of using state funds for personal dining and catering services amounting to some $100,000, the justice ministry said on Friday. The ministry statement said the attorney general was considering prosecuting Sara Netanyahu for offences that include fraudulently procuring items, fraud and breach of trust. A post on the prime minister s Facebook page published late on Thursday in response to media reports about a forthcoming announcement by Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, said the claims against Sara Netanyahu were  absurd and will be proven to be unfounded . It was unclear what political impact Friday s announcement might have on Netanyahu, who himself is under investigation in two corruption cases.  One of those, known as Case 1000, involves gifts that the prime minister and his family may have received from businessmen, while Case 2000 deals with alleged efforts by him to secure better coverage from an Israeli newspaper publisher. Netanyahu - who has been prime minister for 11 years over four terms - has denied any wrongdoing.  Netanyahu leads a relatively stable coalition government and presides over a buoyant economy. His conservative Likud party has rallied behind him in the absence of clear rivals for the leadership, rebuffing calls for his departure from the center-left opposition. Likud s religious-nationalist coalition partners, seeing no threat to their agenda with Netanyahu as prime minister, are likewise sticking with him for now. In a case dubbed  the meals-ordering affair  by the Justice Ministry, Sara Netanyahu with help from an aide allegedly created a false impression between 2010-2013 that no cooks were employed at the prime minister s official residence, while indeed there were, according to the ministry statement. This was done, the statement said, to procure state funding for outside catering that would have been covered had there been no chef.  In this way, hundreds of meals from restaurants and chefs worth 359,000 shekels ($102,399) were received from the state fraudulently,  said the justice ministry statement. Sara Netanyahu has the option to plead her case in a hearing with the attorney general. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",0
"Trump, dogged at home, begins longest presidential Asia trip in years","HONOLULU (Reuters) - President Donald Trump arrived in Hawaii on Friday as he set out on the longest trip to Asia by an American president in more than a quarter century, looking for help to pressure North Korea to stand down from a nuclear crisis. After Air Force One landed at Joint Base Hickam, Trump and his wife, Melania, were draped with traditional lei necklaces. Trump went on to nearby Camp Smith for a classified briefing from Pacific Command military leaders that officials expected would touch on North Korea and other areas. Later, he was to visit Pearl Harbor and the USS Arizona memorial for the U.S. sailors killed when Japan bombed the American naval base on Dec. 7, 1941. Trump’s 12-day trip to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines, ending on Nov. 14, takes him out of Washington at a time when he has been beset by several issues. These include an intensifying federal investigation into Russian meddling in last year’s election, New York’s recovery from an attack earlier this week that killed eight people, and debate over a Republican tax-cut plan that if approved by Congress would be Trump’s first major legislative victory. The trip began just days after Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort was indicted in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and after his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, faced Democratic calls to appear before Congress again to clarify his previous testimony about the campaign’s Russia contacts. Amid the furor caused by the revelations, the Kremlin said on Friday that a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin at an Asian economic summit next week was being discussed, and Trump said it might happen. “We may have a meeting with Putin,” Trump told Fox News. “And, again – Putin is very important because they can help us with North Korea. They can help us with Syria. We have to talk about Ukraine.” Court documents made public on Monday also disclosed that a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty early last month to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The documents cited a March 2016 meeting, when Trump was campaigning for the presidency, and attended by Trump and Sessions, in which Papadopoulos offered to help arrange a meeting between Trump and Putin. While Trump tweeted about developments vigorously this week, he told The New York Times on Wednesday that he was “not angry at anybody” about the case and there was nothing to suggest any collusion by his campaign and Russia. Trump’s plan for an extended absence from Washington has alarmed allies who, after seeing a healthcare reform bid fizzle, worry the tax effort could suffer without Trump to keep momentum going. On Saturday, Trump is to fly to Japan and later visit South Korea in search of a united front against North Korea before going to Beijing, where he will push Chinese President Xi Jinping to get tougher with Pyongyang. In the Fox interview, Trump was asked if he planned to be tough on China over thorny issues including trade, intellectual property theft and subsidies. “You have to understand something - very important,” he responded. “We have a problem called North Korea.” Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping “has been pretty terrific” in cutting Pyongyang off from banking and oil systems. He added that Japan had reason to be worried about North Korea and alluded to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s campaign for a military buildup against that threat. “Well, you know Japan is a warrior nation,” he said. “I tell China and I tell everyone else that, listen, you’re going to have yourself a big problem with Japan pretty soon if you allow this to continue with North Korea.” Trump will attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Danang, Vietnam, make a state visit to Hanoi and end his trip with the Association of South East Asia Nations summit in Manila. Trump told reporters before leaving on Friday that he would spend an extra day in the Philippines. The last time a U.S. president was in Asia for so long was in late 1991 and early 1992, when President George H.W. Bush became ill at a Japanese state dinner. ",politicsNews,"November 3, 2017 ",0

Trump supports completion of Dakota Access Pipeline,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday said for the first time that he supports the completion of a pipeline project near a North Dakota Indian reservation, which has been the subject of months of protests by tribes and environmentalists.  A communications briefing from Trump’s transition team said despite media reports that Trump owns a stake in Energy Transfer Partners, the company building the pipeline, Trump’s support of the pipeline “has nothing to do with his personal investments and everything to do with promoting policies that benefit all Americans.”   “Those making such a claim are only attempting to distract from the fact that President-elect Trump has put forth serious policy proposals he plans to set in motion on Day One,” said the daily briefing note sent to campaign supporters and congressional staff. Activists have spent months protesting plans to route the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline beneath a lake near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, saying the project poses a threat to water resources and sacred Native American sites. On Thursday, U.S. military veterans were arriving at a camp to join thousands of activists braving snow and freezing temperatures to protest the pipeline. Republican Trump has been a vocal supporter of another high-profile pipeline project, Transcanada’s Keystone XL, which Democratic President Barack Obama denied a permit for last year. Republican North Dakota Senator John Hoeven said he met with Trump’s transition team to discuss the delayed pipeline. “Today, Mr. Trump expressed his support for the Dakota Access Pipeline, which has met or exceeded all environmental standards set forth by four states and the Army Corps of Engineers,” Hoeven said in a statement. “It is important to know that the new administration will work to help us grow and diversify our energy economy and build the energy infrastructure necessary to move it from where it is produced to where it is needed,” he said.

 Lawrence O’Donnell Reveals What Would Happen If Trump Retracted A Lie Per Day (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is a liar. This is pretty well-established by now. But on Friday he stopped telling The Big Lie, the one that allowed him to rise to political prominence and the one upon which so much of his initial support was based: Barack Obama is not a U.S. citizen.For years, Trump has harangued the President over his birth certificate, passport, college transcripts, and anything else the billionaire could use to delegitimize the first black President of the United States. The 2016 nominee was, in effect, the leader of the  birthers,  a movement he did not start but gladly latched onto, fueled, and drove forward as he and his cohorts ineffectively but annoyingly attacked Obama.Trump offered no apology. In fact, he spent only about 20 seconds admitting that President Obama was born in the United States,  period. That was one lie. But what if Trump were to retract a lie per day? Could he do it? Would he even live long enough to do so? MSNBC s Lawrence O Donnell tackled the issue on Friday. Pointing out that Trump, via his doctor s shady letter The Donald allowed  Dr. Oz  to look at, was willing to lie about a single inch   adding one inch to his actual height to narrowly avoid being classified as medically obese. Let s just assume Donald Trump is much healthier than he looks. Let s even assume he s taller and thinner than he really is,  O Donnell says, deciding to estimate that Trump would live longer than his father. If Trump lived until 95 years old, he will be around for  another 9,131 days. If Trump were to retract one lie per day for the rest of his life,  he can retract 9,131 lies,  O Donnell points out, but there s a problem. In retracting The Big Lie, he told two more: that Hillary Clinton started the  birther  rumors, and that Trump stopped them through his racist badgering of President Obama. If he does it the way he did it today, the lies of Donald Trump will live after him because as he retracted one lie today he told two more,  O Donnell says.  I think we know that Donald Trump isn t going to retract a lie every day. I think we know that Donald Trump is going to continue to lie every day.  Then he brought it home: I think we know that there is nothing too small for Donald Trump to lie about, including that extra inch of height he decided he needed this week. He will lie about an inch. I think we know there s nothing too big for Donald Trump to lie about, nothing too big, nothing too solemn He will lie about anything. And so I think we know that long after he s gone, long after his name has disappeared from buildings, the lies of Donald Trump will live after him.

Factbox: Austrian parties' red lines and preferences on coalitions,"VIENNA (Reuters) - No party is likely to obtain a majority of votes in Austria s parliamentary election on Oct. 15.  A coalition between two of the three biggest parties   the conservative People s Party (OVP), the Social Democrats (SPO) and the far-right Freedom Party (FPO)   will probably be needed to govern.  Below is a breakdown of polling, positions and comments the parties have made about potential coalitions. Since 31-year-old Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz took over as leader of the OVP in May, his party has consistently attracted support in polls of around 33 percent on a platform dominated by tough rhetoric on immigration. That has dislodged the Freedom Party from the top position in polls it reached in the aftermath of the refugee influx of 2015 and 2016. The Freedom Party is competing with Chancellor Christian Kern s Social Democrats for second place, both at around a quarter of votes in most polls. Polls put the Greens, the liberal Neos and a new party founded by former Greens lawmaker Peter Pilz all on around 5 percent of the vote, above the 4-percent threshold for entering parliament. OVP leader Kurz called an end to the centrist coalition with the Social Democrats, triggering a snap parliamentary election. He has not ruled out any party as a potential coalition partner and has said he will hold talks with  all parties  if his party comes first.  Kurz has avoided setting conditions before the vote apart from saying that any potential partner must be pro-European and not merely  stand by Europe, but also have the desire to shape Europe .    His plans on cutting immigration, reducing the corporation tax burden and streamlining the EU overlap with the Freedom Party s.  The OVP wants a slimmer EU that focuses on its  core competences  such as trade and securing its external borders. In contrast to the FPO, however, Kurz is in favor of more European defense cooperation, which he says would not threaten Austria s neutrality.  The FPO says it would only go into a coalition if it were given control of the Interior Ministry. It also would like to secure the post of foreign minister, but has not made that a fixed condition. FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache has said the FPO will not enter a coalition with the SPO until a full SPO party conference has lifted the ban on coalitions with his party. The decision to lift the ban was taken by the SPO party leadership. The FPO has also said it would only enter a coalition that results in more referendums or  direct democracy , which is part of the OVP program. Strache has rowed back from the FPO s former stark euroskepticism, but he has called the idea of a  European army  a red line. He says Austria is  at the heart of Europe  but also wants a referendum on Austria s future in the EU if it hands more powers to Brussels or if Turkey accedes to the bloc.  Strache has also ruled out that the FPO will sign up to a coalition headed by the third-placed party if it comes second, as it did in 2000 when it became a junior partner to the OVP. Under Chancellor Christian Kern, the SPO has lifted self-imposed ban on national coalitions with the Freedom Party (the two parties already govern together in Burgenland, one of Austria s nine provinces).  The ban was replaced by a  values compass , which makes principles such as a pro-European position and gender equality pre-conditions for cooperation. Kern has also said the FPO must leave the far-right faction in the European Parliament, which France s National Front is also part of, if it wants to join a coalition with the Social Democrats. In a recent debate with Strache, Kern said the two parties are still  worlds apart .  The Social Democrats favor closer European integration on issues like economic and monetary union and social policy.  ",worldnews,"October 13, 2017 ",0
"U.S. must stop judicial 'extortion' of corporate Europe, French lawmakers say","PARIS (Reuters) - Europe should challenge the United States over its increasingly aggressive use of extraterritorial laws that have cost European companies - especially banks - billions in fines and other settlements, a French parliamentary report said. Still reeling from the $9 billion fine its biggest bank, BNP Paribas, had to pay U.S. authorities over violations of American sanctions against other countries, the French government has criticized in recent years what it considers the over-reach of the U.S. legal system. Paris’s main objections center on the U.S. Department of Justice’s broad interpretation of what it considers its jurisdiction. This sphere of influence can include transactions between non-Americans outside the U.S. where the U.S. dollar currency is involved. It can also cover deals and other actions taking place via the Internet using U.S. computer servers. “We consider that today’s situation amounts to abusive use of American law,” Karine Berger, a lawmaker from the ruling Socialist party told Reuters in an interview, calling the practices akin to “extortion”. “We ask France and Europe to let it be known to the United States that we will no longer accept this type of behavior.” In a non-binding investigative report last week, lawmakers from both the Socialist party and opposition conservatives said U.S. law appeared to be more punitive toward foreign firms than domestic ones. Although foreign firms accounted for only 30 percent of investigations opened by U.S. authorities between 1977 and 2014 under its anti-foreign bribery law, 67 percent of the amount levied in fines came from foreign companies, the report said. Since 2009, European banks such as HSBC and Deutsche Bank have paid about $16 billion to the United States over breaches of various sanction regimes. European firms have also accounted for 14 of the 15 biggest penalties, the report said. The report did not question U.S. regulators’ current prosecution of Deutsche Bank over mis-selling toxic mortgage securities before the financial crisis, since the actions took place in the United States. But it did say the DoJ had not taken account of the impact on the financial system that the $14 billion fine it sought from the German bank went on to have. Swiss bank Credit Suisse said on Sunday it has put five employees on leave while it investigates a tax-related matter. Swiss paper SonntagsZeitung reported that the move was connected to a U.S. probe of the bank’s Israeli unit over possible tax evasion. Berger said Europe’s response had not been forceful enough, and that both the European Union and individual member states should adapt their own legislation, which is why the report will be sent to counterparts at other EU parliaments. “There must be a legal rearmament in Europe, so we fight on equal terms with the United States in the field of economic competition,” Berger said.   The European Union should consider challenging parts of the U.S. sanction regime at the World Trade Organisation, the report said, citing a 1998 precedent when Europeans successfully forced the U.S. to back down over Congressional sanctions against Cuba, Libya and Iran that could have affected European firms. The EU should update a 1996 ban on European firms complying with U.S. sanctions based on such extraterritorial legislation, giving European firms a legal “excuse” to reject U.S. demands. European countries and institutions should also encourage the use of the euro for global transactions and strengthen the use of intelligence services for economic means. Citing the recent EU ruling asking Apple to pay up to 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland, Berger said Europe should not be afraid to be more confrontational. “It shows Europe is perfectly capable of waging this economic war since the U.S. is only going to keep it up,” she said.

Germany will strive to save Iran nuclear deal: Gabriel,"NEW YORK/BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany will do all it can to persuade the United States not to abandon the Iranian nuclear agreement, whatever the outcome of German elections on Sunday, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said on Thursday. Gabriel told reporters any U.S. move to cancel the Iran deal and impose new sanctions on Tehran would discourage powers such as North Korea from negotiating an end to their own nuclear programs. Germany would work with the European Union, France, Britain and where possible China and Russia to press Washington to preserve the deal, under which Iran curbed its nuclear work in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, he said on the sidelines of a U.N. meeting in New York. Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives are poised to win Sunday s elections, but it remains unclear if Gabriel s Social Democrats will play a role in the next coalition government. Gabriel said Germany would maintain its position on the Iran deal, regardless of which parties formed the next government. U.S. President Donald Trump has called the Iran deal  an embarrassment , but Germany and other powers who also negotiated it with Iran fear its collapse could trigger a regional arms race. Trump must decide by Oct. 15 whether to certify that Iran is complying with the pact. If he does not, Congress has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the accord.  Now we will all try to convince the Americans in the remaining weeks ... that calling the agreement into question will not increase security,  Gabriel said.  The United States said on Wednesday it was weighing whether the nuclear accord served its security interests. Iran said it did not expect Washington to abandon it.  Gabriel said Germany would have to consider whether to stick to the agreement even if Washington backed out, but said that could prove  very difficult , given that the United States would immediately impose new sanctions against Iran. He said Iran was complying with the deal but businesses had been reluctant to commit to investments and contracts out of concern that the United States could re-impose sanctions under the agreement s  snapback provision . Gabriel said it was  tragic  that the only agreement aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons was being called into question.  In Berlin, German Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries said Germany, as one of Iran s most important trading partners in Europe, had a  great interest  in preserving the agreement. German exports to Iran rose 23 percent to 1.4 billion euros in the first half of 2017. The foreign minister said he accepted the U.S. position that Iran s behavior in the Middle East had not improved since the deal - but added there was no hope of it changing its ways if the accord fell. Any collapse would send a  terrible signal  for other diplomatic efforts.  What should motivate countries like North Korea or others to enter into negotiations in the future when the one example of such a deal is being destroyed?  he said.

NORTH KOREA: Trump’s Recklessness Could Trigger All-Out Conflict on Korean Peninsula," 21st Century Wire says Washington s muscle flexing seems to have taken on a life of its own as the shadow of US neocolonialism falls over much of the world with increasing intensity. In Syria, the US is lashing out, lawlessly, at the bastion of resistance that has been denying its objectives for almost seven years. Now, the US secretary of State, Rex Tillerson has declared that China should  exert much greater economic and diplomatic pressure  on North Korea to step away from its nuclear and missile programmes. Footage of a reported, massive  live fire  drill conducted by the North Koreans in April 2017 gives some indication of what the US might face if this  escalation  is magnified beyond recall, by the usual suspects at Fox News and CNN This report is from Peter Symonds of WSWS:In what amounted to a barely disguised threat, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson yesterday declared that China had to  exert much greater economic and diplomatic pressure  on North Korea to abandon its nuclear and missile programs, if it  wants to prevent a further escalation in the region. In other words, if Beijing fails to rein in the Pyongyang regime, the US could resort to military measures.Tillerson s remarks followed a top-level meeting in Washington between him and US Defence Secretary James Mattis and their Chinese counterparts China s foreign policy chief Yang Jiechi and General Fang Fenghui, chief of the People s Liberation Army s joint staff department.Tillerson called on China to make greater efforts to halt  illicit  revenue streams to North Korea that allegedly help fund Pyongyang s military programs. Just last week, he told a congressional committee the Trump administration was  at a stage  where  we are going to have to   start taking secondary sanctions that is, penalise countries and corporations that engage in economic activities with North Korea.Unilateral  secondary sanctions  imposed by the US would, above all, fall on Chinese companies. China is, by far, North Korea s largest trading partner. US officials and the media have repeatedly accused Beijing of failing to do enough to choke off trade and finance with the Pyongyang regime. Any penalties against Chinese individuals or entities would quickly sour relations between the US and China.Just before the talks, US President Donald Trump signalled that time was running out for China to force North Korea to bow to US demands.  While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi [Jinping] and China,  he tweeted on Tuesday,  it has not worked out. While Tillerson s remarks indicate the US continues to pressure China for action against North Korea, Trump s tweet is a warning that the US will resort to other measures including military action if there are no results.Asked about Trump s tweet, Defence Secretary Mattis told the joint press conference with Tillerson:  What you re seeing I think is the American people s frustration with a regime that provokes and provokes and provokes and basically plays outside the rules, plays fast and loose with the truth. Mattis denounced Pyongyang in particular for the death of Otto Wambier the American student imprisoned in North Korea who died on Monday after being flown back to the US last week. The Trump administration is considering a ban to prevent Americans from visiting Pyongyang. Three other US citizens are currently jailed in North Korea.The comments of Mattis and Tillerson suggest that relations with China could deteriorate rapidly, especially if North Korea conducts another nuclear test or a long-range missile launch. In comments to CNN, unnamed US officials claimed this week that satellite imagery showed new activity at North Korea s underground nuclear test site and suggested that a sixth nuclear detonation could be imminent.Ahead of yesterday s talks in Washington, US State Department officials indicated that Mattis and Tillerson would press their Chinese counterparts not only on North Korea, but a range of other sensitive issues, including the South China Sea and the so-called war on terrorism.Acting Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia, Susan Thornton, told Voice of America that  all parties should freeze any construction or militarisation of features  in the South China Sea a comment directed especially at China. Last month, the US navy carried out another provocative  freedom of navigation  operation, sending a guided missile destroyer within the 12-nautical-mile territorial limit claimed by China around one of its islets.Trade and economic issues were excluded from yesterday s US-China Diplomatic and Security Dialogue but remained just below the surface. During last year s presidential election campaign, Trump repeatedly denounced China s trade policies and threatened punitive trade war measures. In seeking Beijing s assistance to pressure Pyongyang, Trump suggested the US could make concessions on trade.Having tweeted that Chinese efforts have  not worked out,  the implicit threat is that the US could ramp up the pressure on China over trade.  What Trump is saying is, I don t need you on North Korea now, and therefore maybe we should have it out on these other issues, like trade,  analyst John Delury told the New York Times.China is reluctant to impose new sanctions that will cripple North Korea s economy and provoke a political crisis that could be exploited by the US and its allies. At yesterday s talks, Chinese officials reiterated Beijing s call for renewed negotiations based on a freeze by Pyongyang on its nuclear and missile tests and a freeze by Washington on its joint military exercises in South Korea. The US has flatly rejected the proposal.Above all, the threat of US military strikes against North Korea hangs over Asia. Earlier this week, the Pentagon again sent two B-1 strategic bombers on a mission over the Korean Peninsula in a provocative show of force. The US Navy has two aircraft carrier strike groups stationed in the area, with another on its way.Any US military action against North Korea threatens to trigger an all-out conflict on the Korean Peninsula that could draw in other powers, including China, with devastating consequences. The Trump administration s recklessness is underscored by the fact that it is engaged in an escalating confrontation in Syria that threatens to provoke a clash with Russia and Iran, even as it is ramping up tensions in North East Asia.***FOR MORE INFORMATION ON NORTH KOREA: 21WIRE NORTH KOREA FILESSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"June 22, 2017",1

German citizen on trial in Turkey on political charges: media,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A 49-year-old woman has become the first German citizen to stand trial in Turkey on allegations of supporting U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkish authorities blame for a failed military coup last year, German media reported. Broadcasters WDR and NDR and daily newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung said the trial began in the southern Turkish city of Karaman on Thursday and cited the indictment as saying the woman faced several years in prison. They said the woman, whom they did not name, was born in Turkey but had lived in southwest Germany for more than 20 years and had been a German citizen for 15. She had been arrested in Turkey in August 2016 and released in September after pressure from Germany s foreign ministry but was not allowed to leave the country, they said. Earlier on Thursday, the ministry confirmed that another German citizen detained in southern Turkey last week had been released but banned from travel. Turkey s Dogan news agency said the man and his German partner had been detained while on holiday in Antalya. The partner had already been freed after questioning. Dogan said the couple had also been held as part of investigations into Gulen and Kurdish militants in Syria. Gulen has denied any link to the failed coup. Thursday s release means 10 German citizens remain in Turkish detention on political charges. The arrests have raised tensions between Ankara and Berlin and led Chancellor Angela Merkel to call for a review of relations and of Turkey s EU accession talks. The detainees include dual German-Turkish citizen Deniz Yucel, who has been held for more than 200 days. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",0

"Putin critic Navalny, freed from jail, resumes presidential campaign","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny held a political rally on Sunday, hours after being released from jail and pledged to continue his presidential campaign despite the authorities saying he is ineligible to stand.  Navalny, a fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin, was detained by police in late September and sentenced to 20 days in jail on charges of repeatedly violating laws by organizing public meeting and rallies. It was the third time he had been jailed this year, part of what he says is a pattern of Kremlin harassment designed to thwart his political ambitions. Russia s central election commission has declared him ineligible to run for president next year due to a suspended prison sentence, which he says was politically-motivated. Shrugging off that ban, the 41-year-old lawyer held a campaign rally in the provincial town of Astrakhan in southern Russia on Sunday evening, hours after walking free from jail.  He said after the rally he would continue to campaign and had the right to take part in next year s election.  We have more right to take part in the elections than all the other candidates combined,  Navalny wrote on his website.  Putin, 65, has for months declined to say whether he will run for what would be his fourth stint in the Kremlin, but is  widely expected to do so. Opinion polls suggest he would comfortably win.  One candidate who has declared her hand is TV personality Ksenia Sobchak who said last week she planned to run, offering liberal voters unhappy with Putin s rule someone to back, though she has little prospect of winning. Some opposition activists fret she is a Kremlin project designed to split the opposition, something she denies. Last month, commenting on rumors that Sobchak would run, Navalny complained she was being used by the Kremlin as a safe lightning conductor for voters  dissatisfaction. But he struck a more conciliatory note on Sunday with TV Rain citing him as saying that everyone, including Sobchak, had the right to take part in the March election.

Boston mayor says not subject of federal probe into labor unions,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Boston Mayor Martin Walsh, a former labor leader, said on Monday that federal agents had not contacted him in connection with what local media has described as a wide-ranging investigation into whether the city’s building unions used strong-arm tactics. The Boston Globe reported over the weekend, citing unnamed sources, that Walsh had been implicated in a federal investigation into whether city union officials threatened developers who hired nonunion workers on projects in and around the city. “I haven’t been contacted myself,” Walsh told reporters on Monday.  A Democrat, Walsh is a former construction worker who led the city’s Building and Construction Trades Council, a union grouping, for two years before his 2013 mayoral election victory.

If that’s the case, I will not be getting one of those,” Walsh said. “Because I did nothing wrong.” A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Boston could not be reached for immediate comment.

 Local Fox Affiliate Just Gave Fox News A GIANT Middle Finger Over Their Biased News,"A local news station in Boston has had it with the Fox brand damaging their own reputation. WFXT Channel 25 is going to change the name of its newscast to Boston 25 News removing  Fox  entirely following a drop in its ratings and a study that showed their audience saw the newscast as  leaning conservative. Fox News itself has some ridiculous shows, like Fox & Friends and The O Reilly Factor, both of which tend to peddle not just misleading information, but also the very attitudes that make things worse, not better, in this country. For instance, on Fox & Friends this morning, Brian Kilmeade whined about conditions in immigration detention centers. But he wasn t talking about the stunning human rights abuses. He s upset about this: Get this: They re enjoying seven hours of outdoor activity. Who gets that anymore? Fresh sheets, and absolutely   I don t get that. No need to learn English. Co-host Ainsley Earhardt added: Seven hours of outdoor activity, freshly washed sheets, and absolutely no need to learn English. That s the easy life of an illegal immigrant inside American jails. Or clean sheets have something to do with basic sanitation, but hey, they ll think what they want here. The outdoor activity   it s not like they re in some Eden-like garden of paradise.There s also the whole controversy with Bill O Reilly and sexual harassment, and Fox News  failure to deal with their male employees who engage in such behavior. Billo the Clown is still on the air, and so far, Fox doesn t seem to have done much about it.Who wants to be associated with this crapola? WFXT is actually owned by Cox Media Group and not Fox News, but they re still considered a Fox affiliate and the brand carries a reputation that is increasingly negative. Massachusetts is a deep blue state, and their businesses and media outlets need to act accordingly to continue reaching their audiences.This decision is actually a few years in the making   it didn t just happen. WFXT s news director, Mike Oliveria, said that Massachusetts viewers want unbiased news. Fox News is decidedly not unbiased, but WFXT strives to be, as do most local newscasts. He said: It s not that [Fox is] a bad brand; it s just that it s not ours. While other Fox affiliates under Cox Media s umbrella aren t considering dropping  Fox  from their names at this time, we have t wonder if that s going to change.Featured image by Spencer Platt via Getty Images",News,"April 14, 2017",1
 Spice Company Owner Causes Family Feud When He Calls Trump ‘Racist’,"After eight years of being told that Barack Obama is the most divisive president in the history of the United States, Republicans actually elected the most divisive president in the history of the United States. It seems that the election of Donald Trump is causing more than just a rift between Democrats and Republicans and between white men and everyone else. It s causing rifts among families and that s no more evident than in the  spice wars  that s happening between two feuding spice-owning branches of the same family.Penzeys Spices in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin caused controversy when it emailed its customers its owners opinions about Donald Trump. They weren t positive.

Penzey also answered his numerous critics. Penzey was clear that he wasn t calling all Republicans racist, just the Republicans who voted for Trump:(Y)ou just voted for an openly racist candidate for the presidency of the United States of America. In your defense, most of you did so without thinking of the consequences of your candidate s racism because, for most of you the heartbreaking destruction racism causes has never been anything you or your loved ones have had to experience. But the thing is elections have their consequences. This is no longer sixty years ago. Whether any of us like it or not, for the next four years the 80% of this country who did not just vote for an openly racist candidate are going to treat you like you are the kind of person who would vote for an openly racist candidate.He also appealed to the people that might be having buyer s remorse, urging them to donate to the ACLU of the SPLC.Still, not all customers are happy, but some noted that Penzey has always been outspoken and for liberals, on the right path.In some people, Penzey s has found new customers:Penzey s sister Patty, who co-owns the Milwaukee-based The Spice House with her husband, is not amused:Yet another awkward Thanksgiving, thanks to our most contentious election since 2000.Featured image via Penzeys Facebook Page.

 Republicans Punish Georgia Governor For Refusing To Legalize Anti-LGBT Bigotry,"Georgia conservatives really wanted to enshrine their hate and bigotry into law under the guise of religious liberty, and because their governor refused to do so they are punishing him.Unlike the Republican governors of North Carolina and Mississippi, Georgia Governor Nathan Deal refused to sign the anti-LGBT bill passed by the GOP-controlled legislature. Deal mulled over the bill while witnessing the economic backlash similar bills are causing other states.In North Carolina alone, corporations are threatening to leave or have cancelled plans to expand into the state, resulting in the loss of hundreds of jobs and money that could have sparked economic growth. Furthermore, the state also faces the loss of federal dollars. Mississippi is facing the same backlash and South Carolina has also suffered the loss of a corporate headquarters for just introducing the bill.Georgia certainly faced the same consequences. Disney and Marvel threatened to stop filming movies in the state and other corporations and businesses urged the governor to veto the bill.Realizing that the economic backlash was not worth it, Governor Deal vetoed HB 757. He angered conservatives but saved the economy of his state from ruin.But those conservatives were looking forward to being able to use their Bibles as a shield so they can discriminate against anyone they please.And so, they decided to send a message to Republicans and any Republican who sits in the governor s mansion in the future that not doing what they want is unacceptable and will be punished.Despite being urged not to do so, conservatives of the Georgia Third District voted overwhelmingly to censure Deal. According to the Atlanta Journal Constitution: Though it is purely symbolic, it s a startling sign of the conservative backlash to Deal s decision to reject the legislation   and another reminder that the debate over the measure never really ended. A censure is a formal statement of severe disapproval, which means Republicans literally just punished Deal publicly for refusing to support a bigoted policy supported by conservatives in his state.It s basically a warning shot to other Republicans that they better not veto future efforts to legalize discrimination in Georgia or they too could be censured or worse.This is why Republicans made a huge mistake by letting extremists have a mainstream seat at the party table. Because now they are beholden to do as the extremists desire or else.Featured image via  YouTube",News,"April 17, 2016",1
"How TYSON FOODS Is DESTROYING Small Towns…Forcing Taxpayers To Pick Up Housing, Healthcare Costs For Muslim Refugees","This is a story you won t likely find anywhere else, as both political parties seem to be okay with the import of low wage workers from foreign countries. Meanwhile, we have millions of American citizens who have given up any hope of finding a job, and many more who are being paid more by our government to stay home. LEXINGTON, Neb.   The old Longhorn Laundry is an unlikely place for a showdown over the First Amendment.You could easily miss the nondescript concrete building on a quiet downtown corner of this old cow town.But ever since a group of Somali workers from the local meatpacking plant spread out a sea of Persian rugs in the expansive former laundry and began holding Muslim prayer services five times a day, there has been controversy.City officials maintain that mosque leaders are ignoring local zoning laws and thumbing their noses at requirements for building permits and fire-code inspections.They insist that the flap is about a lack of parking, not a denial of religious freedom, and that it wasn t spurred by  Islamophobia. The attraction is employment at Tyson Foods:African Muslims, mostly from war-torn Somalia, started arriving in the mid-2000s. Census estimates put the number of Somalis in Lexington at 769 in 2014   a 40 percent increase from 2000. Local Somalis and those who work with them say there actually may be 1,500 or more living in the community.Across Nebraska, census estimates show 2,100 Somali-born residents clustered in Omaha and Lincoln, and near meatpacking plants in Grand Island and Madison, as well as Lexington.Since Obama was elected, Nebraska has  welcomed  6,716 refugees and the numbers have been increasing each of those years.Most of the refugees (seeded in Nebraska by federal  church  contractors) are Burmese or Iraqis, but of course Somalis have been resettled as well. (There are small numbers of Muslim Burmese and the largest group of Iraqis we admit to the US are Muslims. Somalis are virtually all Muslim.)For centuries, immigrants in search of a better life have been drawn to America s largest cities. Now, in part because of the meatpacking industry, recent immigrants have been seeking out small, rural towns. But many of these towns are struggling to provide the social services needed by such a diverse population that s largely invisible to most Americans.Noel, Mo is one of those small towns in America affected by the huge influx of mostly Somalian Muslim immigrants.Noel, Mo., has been dubbed the  Christmas City  and  Canoe Capital of the Ozarks  thanks to the Elk River, which winds through town. But this Missouri town of fewer than 2,000 residents thrives because of the Tyson Foods Inc. chicken processing complex located here it alone employs about 1,600 people. Just 20 years ago, Noel had only about half as many residents, and most of them were white. Then in the 1990s, Hispanics most of them Mexican moved to Noel to process chicken. Pacific Islanders and refugees from parts of Myanmar and Africa followed. We do have small towns that have had 100 to 200 percent growth that have really changed overnight over the past 20 years and have a much larger immigrant population than they used to,  says Lisa Dorner, a University of Missouri education professor who has done extensive research on immigrant children growing up in small towns and suburbs. Dorner thinks such major demographic changes don t always sit well with local residents.How on earth our federal CHURCH contractors can be aiding and abetting this travesty continues to be beyond my understanding.From Progressives for Immigration Reform (emphasis RRW):In her NPR news story, In A Small Missouri Town, Immigrants Turn To Schools For Help, writer Abbie Fentress Swanson chronicles the plight of newly arrived immigrants to the small, rural town of Noel, Missouri. It seems that longtime residents there are not dealing well with sudden demographic changes. Consequently, immigrants from Mexico, Myanmar, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, and the Pinglap region of Micronesia are among those feeling unwelcome and isolated in this formerly white community, which saw its population double to 2,000 in just two decades.Many of these immigrants are so poor they cannot afford housing or healthcare. Their children often lack shoes and clothes. As Swanson notes, about 90% of the community s children would go hungry most of the school day, if they didn t qualify for free or low-cost meals. With such an influx of people, Noel has not been able to keep up with providing social services. There is a long wait list for units from the local housing authority, and building more housing would strain the town s sewer system, already at 80% capacity.Immigrants are attracted to Noel by jobs at the chicken processing plant of Tyson Foods, which employs 1,600 people. The starting wage is a paltry $9.05 per hour, which comes to $362 a week before taxes for an eight-hour, five-day week. Despite health and injury risks to workers in this industry, Swanson calls this a  decent  wage and declines to hold Tyson culpable for perpetuating widespread misery in the cash-strapped town.The nation s largest U.S. meat processor by sales can easily afford to pay its employees in Noel a living wage, but prefers to have the community subsidize the resulting human wreckage. After all, profit is the overriding goal, even if it must be achieved by driving wages so low that most American citizens no longer can afford to work at its processing plants. No matter   the continuous stream of cheap, compliant foreign labor will do just fine. The results are compelling .The Mayor of Noel, MO, John Lafley says Tyson Foods is pushing the town to allow for more housing development, but he s concerned that Noel s infrastructure can t handle more units.The schools system (66% minority children!) has become the de facto social services department trying to stem poverty in the immigrant households.The mayor says there s no money in the budget either to provide the social services needed in this small, remote town, which sits not far from the Missouri-Kansas-Arkansas-Oklahoma borders. For rural Missouri, Tyson plant jobs pay decent wages that start at $9.05 an hour. Still, poverty looms large here. About 90 percent of Noel school students qualify for free or reduced-cost meals. The number of homeless children has doubled in the past five years. Because the nearest food pantry and free clinic are miles away, many plant workers turn to their children s schools for help.Tyson Foods wants the town to build more housing, but the town can t afford the infrastructure costs.Affordable housing is also a problem here in Noel. There s a long waiting list for open units at the local housing authority. You cannot rent a house right now. If you look, try to find a house, you can t,  says Faisal Ali Ahmed, a Somali refugee who works the night shift at the Tyson plant as a forklift driver.  It s a very difficult life. If they shut down this company now, nobody stay in this bush.John Lafley, the mayor of Noel, says longtime residents need to be sensitized to immigrants  needs, and immigrants need to try to fit in. We re trying to assimilate people that don t understand the American way. And they want to keep their own ways, which is not that popular,  Lafley says.Lafley says Tyson Foods is pushing the town to allow for more housing development, but he s concerned that Noel s infrastructure can t handle more units.The schools system (66% minority children!) has become the de facto social services department trying to stem poverty in the immigrant households.The mayor says there s no money in the budget either to provide the social services needed in this small, remote town, which sits not far from the Missouri-Kansas-Arkansas-Oklahoma borders.

Then this:Assimilation is not the real problem facing Noel, Missouri nor is it street-level bickering about matters of race, religion and values. The larger issue is what to do about rogue corporations that run roughshod over small communities in pursuit of profit, little of which is invested locally. Of greater concern is that our government wants to overload the job market even more through mass immigration policies, which will lay waste to many more small communities throughout America.And, what do you do about federal contractors for the US State Department wearing the white hat of do-gooderism while helping Tyson Foods make the profit!For entire story: Refugee Resettlement Watch",left-news,"May 17, 2016",1
 BREAKING: New Poll Shows HUGE Lead For Hillary As Trump’s Downward Spiral Continues,"With 28 days left to go until election day, a new poll from NBC/Wall Street Journal, a gold-standard in polling, shows Hillary Clinton posting an unprecedented double-digit lead over Donald Trump.The first major poll since the revelations exposed in a recent audio leak   in which he boasted about sexually assaulting women by grabbing their genitals without consent   shows that not only has Clinton posted a 14 point lead in a head-to-head contest, she has opened up an 11-point lead in the four-way race with the Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and the Green Party s nominee, Jill Stein.Because of Trump s admission to sexually assaulting women doesn t bode well for voters, the House is now in play   something that no one, just one week ago, thought would be possible. Forty-nine percent of voters want to see a Democratic Congress while 42 percent want to see a GOP Congress. That s a three point uptick for Democrats.Forty-one percent of voters called the tapes  completely unacceptable  and 52 percent said it should be an issue in the campaign.While Republicans try desperately to write it off as simple  locker room talk,  the electorate isn t buying it and they are actually, reasonably so, disgusted by it.The poll also shows that Clinton has opened up a 21 point lead with women. That is a nine point difference than it was in mid-September when it was a smaller (yet still significant) 12 point lead.Remember: John McCain lost the female vote by 13 points, and Mitt Romney lost by 11. Both times women made up 53 percent of the total electorate. You can t lose female voters this  bigly  and win a national election.If Trump continues to lose by a whopping 21 points, he s absolutely done.With future tapes on the horizon, the Trump campaign has pretty much run out of time. Republicans are abandoning him, the electorate is abandoning him, and his campaign is crashing and burning.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"October 10, 2016",1

Puerto Rico expects U.S. to lift Jones Act shipping restrictions,"(Reuters) - Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello said on Wednesday he expected the federal government to waive the Jones Act, which would lift restrictions on ships that can provide aid to the island devastated by Hurricane Maria. He said he has been speaking with members of Congress from both parties who have supported an emergency waiver.      “We expect them to waive it,” Rossello said in an interview with CNN. He noted there was a seven-day waiver after Hurricane Irma, which was much less devastating to the island.     On Tuesday, the Trump administration said there was no need to waive shipping restrictions to help get fuel and supplies to storm-ravaged Puerto Rico, saying it would do nothing to address the island’s damaged ports, the main impediment to shipping. A waiver would allow Puerto Rico to get help not only from U.S. ships but from any ships that can bring aid.     “That is critical, particularly for fuel,” he said. “One of the considerations right now is the priority of getting fuel, diesel, gasoline, all across the island. Right now we have enough fuel. We’re limited by the transportation logistics, but at some point of course, getting fuel into the island is going to be critical so that we can have the major functions of telecoms, hospitals, water, to be running appropriately.”     The Jones Act requires that all goods shipped between U.S. ports be carried by American owned-and-operated ships. U.S. Senator John McCain asked acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke on Tuesday to grant an emergency waiver of the law. He said that Puerto Rican residents would have to pay at least twice as much for food, drinking water and other supplies without the waiver. (This corrected version of the story fixes paragraph four to show the administration has not formally denied a waiver request). ",politicsNews,"September 27, 2017 ",0
WATCH: ARROGANT Sexual Predator and Sometimes “Comedian” Louis C.K. Tells Stephen Colbert “Donald Trump Is An Insane Bigot and Hitler”,"The not so funny comedian Louis C.K. appeared on the Stephen Colbert show mostly to talk about his decision to send an email to his fans, where he told them that  Donald Trump is an insane bigot and Hitler . After the self-righteous  comedian  got some laughs from Colbert s liberal audience, Colbert asked them to settle down, that Louis C.K. admitted that after he sent the email, he  regretted it.   C.K. went on to say that he didn t really regret it, he just regretted  saying it , or in other words, he regrets that he was outed as a whiny, liberal, crybaby who can t control his emotions (our translation). One of the most interesting lines in the interview came after the Trump bashing where the outed sexual predator tells Colbert,  I wouldn t take it back. If you went back and fixed all the mistakes you made, you erase yourself. You know, there s just no point to that.  Good luck trying to  erase yourself  after you ve been outed creep Here s part of Louis C.K. s email to his fans: Please stop it with voting for Trump. It was funny for a little while. But the guy is Hitler. And by that I mean that we are being Germany in the 30s. Do you think they saw the shit coming? Hitler was just some hilarious and refreshing dude with a weird comb over who would say anything at all.And I m not advocating for Hillary or Bernie. I like them both but frankly I wish the next president was a conservative only because we had Obama for eight years and we need balance. And not because I particularly enjoy the conservative agenda. I just think the government should reflect the people. And we are about 40 percent conservative and 40 percent liberal. When I was growing up and when I was a younger man, liberals and conservatives were friends with differences. They weren t enemies. And it always made sense that everyone gets a president they like for a while and then hates the president for a while. But it only works if the conservatives put up a good candidate. A good smart conservative to face the liberal candidate so they can have a good argument and the country can decide which way to go this time.Trump is not that. He s an insane bigot. He is dangerous.Watch Louis C.K. joke around with Stephen Colbert about his disdain for President Trump, calling him a  Gross crook, dirty, rotten, lying sack of sh*t. The not so funny  comedian  was outed today as a serial sexual predator.NPR reported that Louis C.K. masturbated in front of multiple female colleagues, to their shock and dismay, according to women who spoke on the record to The New York Times about their experiences.The famous comic has been surrounded by rumors of sexual misconduct for years   specifically, allegations that he would masturbate in front of female colleagues.Last year, the comedian Roseanne Barr told The Daily Beast that C.K. was  about to get busted  for his conduct.  It s Louis C.K., locking the door and masturbating in front of women comics and writers. I can t tell you I ve heard so many stories,  she said. Comedian Tig Notaro acknowledged the allegations this summer and said C.K. needed to  handle  them.But previously, those stories were shared secondhand. Now, five women have spoken to the Times directly, with only one requesting anonymity. You can read the full story   which goes into much more detail   over at the New York Times.This Twitter user nailed it when it comes to just how disgusting Louis C.K. really is:Guys like Louis CK could just pay a sex worker. Could even request the sex worker play like she's uncomfortable if they likes. But they don't want that. The pleasure is in the actual discomfort of their victims, the power to overwhelm or make them just take it. It's horrendous.

Turkey summons German ambassador as tensions mount,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Turkey summoned Germany s ambassador to its foreign ministry on Monday, Berlin said, amid a mounting row between the two NATO powers. Der Spiegel magazine said Ankara wanted to raise a German parliamentary motion last year that declared the 1915 massacre of Armenians by Ottoman forces a genocide - a description that Turkey has long fiercely rejected. There was no immediate comment from Turkish authorities on the summons or the broader dispute, which has been exacerbated by the German parliamentary vote and Berlin s criticism of Ankara s rights record. Germany s foreign ministry said it was the 17th time its envoy Martin Erdmann had been summoned, underlining the divisions at a time when European powers are counting on Turkey to help contain migrant flows, and to confront Islamic State militants over its borders with Iraq and Syria.  Germany has criticized mass arrests carried out in Turkey since last year s failed coup against President Tayyip Erdogan and demanded the release of around a dozen German or Turkish-German citizens arrested in recent months. Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is seeking re-election on Sunday, has called for Turkey s EU accession talks to be called off. Germany also says it is limiting arms sales to Turkey.  Turkey says Germany has ignored Ankara s requests for the extradition of suspects it believes are linked to the putsch and accused Berlin of using Nazi-like tactics by banning pro-Erdogan rallies on German soil. Turkey, which says the killings of Christian Armenians during World War One do not amount to genocide, already recalled its ambassador to Germany after parliament passed the resolution last year.

SWEDEN IS ON BRINK OF COLLAPSE… Gun Purchases Are Way Up…Pepper Spray Selling Out…Muslims Beating Non-Muslims On Streets,"The politically correct country of Sweden paying a very big price for their kindness, generosity and open-borders policy This attack happened in Norrmalmstorg, Stockholm. The two Swedes told them not to vandalize flowerpots   and as a response they got beaten up for it.https://youtu.be/Rsn_1TO1kMUThis is indeed the future of Europe. By their irresponsible, short-sighted, suicidal immigration and refugee policies, Europe s political and media elites have ensured a future of violence, bloodshed and chaos for their people. Sweden, the future of Europe: people stock up on fire arms, police recommend vigilante groups ,  by Nicolai Sennels, 10News.dk, December 12, 2015 (thanks to TheReligionofPeace.com):This is a very interesting read, because the whole of Europe is heading the same way as Sweden. Sweden is, so to speak, the future of Europe. And in this future, those who can afford it pay security companies   the rest gest license for firearms and forms vigilante groups. via: Pamela Gellar You have to understand that Swedes are really scared when an asylum house opens in their village. They can see what has happened in other places.    Salesman for alarm systems.Since Parliament decided in 1975 that Sweden should be multicultural and not Swedish, crime has exploded. Violent crime has increased by over 300% and rapes have increased by an unbelievable 1,472%.The violence at the hands of Muslim migrants  is nothing new to Sweden. This horrific video was published in 2013:Many Swedes see the mass immigration as a forced marriage: Sweden is forced to marry a man she did not choose, yet she is expected to love and honor him, even though he beats her and treats her badly. Her parents (the government) tell her to be warm and show solidarity with him. Are the State and I now in agreement that our mutual contract is being renegotiated?    Alexandra von Schwerin, whose farm who was robbed three times. Police refused to help.Once upon a time, there was a safe welfare state called Sweden, where people rarely locked their doors.Now, this country is a night-watchman state   each man is on his own. When the Minister of Justice, Morgan Johansson, encourages breaking the law, it means opening the gates to anarchy. Mr. and Mrs. Swede have every reason to be worried, with the influx of 190,000 unskilled and unemployed migrants expected this year   equivalent to 2% of Sweden s current population. The number is as if 6.4 million penniless migrants who did not speak English arrived in U.S. in one year, or 1.3 million in Britain.And the Swedes are preparing: demand for firearms licenses is increasing; more and more Swedes are joining shooting clubs and starting vigilante groups. After a slight dip in 2014, the number of new gun permits has gone up significantly again this year. According to police statistics, there are 1,901,325 licensed guns, owned by 567,733 people, in Sweden. Add to this an unknown number of illegal weapons. To get a gun permit in Sweden, you need to be at least 18 years old; law-abiding; well-behaved, and have a hunting license or be a member of an approved shooting club. In 2014, 11,000 people got a hunting license: 10% more than the year before. One out of five was a woman. There is also a high demand for alarm systems right now,  says a salesman at one of the security companies in an interview with Gatestone. It is largely due to the turbulence we are seeing around the country at the moment.  People have lost confidence in the State, he added.  The police will not come anymore. Truck drivers say that when they see a thief emptying the fuel tank of their trucks, they run out with a baseball bat. It is no use calling the police, but if you hit the thief, you can at least prevent him from stealing more diesel. Many homeowners say the same thing: they sleep with a baseball bat under the bed. But this is risky: the police can then say you have been prepared to use force, and that might backfire on you. The salesman, who asked to remain anonymous, also spoke of Sweden s many Facebook groups, in which people in different villages openly discuss how they intend to protect themselves:  Sometimes you get totally freaked out when you see what they are writing. But you have to understand that Swedes are really scared when an asylum house opens in their village. They can see what has happened in other places. One blog, detailing the consequences for the local population when an asylum facility opens, is aptly named Asylkaos ( Asylum Chaos ). There is a list of companies the reader is prompted to boycott; the blog claims these businesses encourage the transformation of Sweden to a multicultural society, and are therefore considered  hostile to Swedes. At another security company, a salesman said that every time the Immigration Service buys or rents a new housing facility, his firm is swamped with calls.  The next day,  he said,  half the village calls and wants to buy alarm systems. Ronny Fredriksson, spokesman of the security company Securitas, said that the demand for home alarm systems first exploded about six years ago, when many local police stations were shut down and police moved to the main towns. This, he said, could result in response times of several hours.  More and more people now employ the services of our security guards. Shopping malls and stores in the city come together and hire guards. We are kind of like the  local beat  cops of old. Even though Securitas makes big money from the increased need for home security alarms and security guards, Fredriksson says they also are worried about the effect on society: The problem is that we too need the police. When our guards catch a burglar or a violent person, we call the police but the response times are often very long. Sometimes, the detainees get violent and quite rowdy. On occasion, the police have told us to release the person we have apprehended, if we have his identity, because they do not have a patrol nearby. Even before the massive influx of migrants in the fall of 2015, Swedes felt a need to protect themselves   and with good reason. Since the Parliament decided in 1975 that Sweden should be multicultural and not Swedish, crime has exploded. Violent crime has increased by more than 300%, and rapes have increased by an unbelievable 1,472%.The politicians, however, ignore the people s fear completely. It is never discussed. Instead, the people who express concern about what kind of country Sweden has become are accused of xenophobia and racism. Most likely, that is the reason more and more people are taking matters into their own hands, and protecting themselves and their families to the best of their ability.All the same, some people do not settle for that. It seems some people are trying to stop mass immigration to Sweden. Almost every day there are reports of fires being set at asylum houses. So far, miraculously, no one has been hurt.These fires are set not only by Swedes. On October 13, a 36-year-old woman living in Skellefte  was convicted of setting fire to the asylum facility in which she herself resided. The woman claimed she lit a candle and then fell asleep. Yet forensic evidence showed that a combustible fluid had been doused throughout the room, and the court found beyond a reasonable doubt that she herself had ignited the fire.The number of violent incidents at Sweden s Immigration Service facilities is now sky-high. In 2013, according to Dispatch International, at least one incident happened every day. When Gatestone Institute recently acquired the incident list for January 1, 2014 through October 29, 2015, that number had risen to 2,177 incidents of threats, violence and brawls   on average, three per day.The Swedish government, however, would apparently rather not talk about that. Foreign Minister Margot Wallstr m conceded, in an interview with the daily Dagens Nyheter that garnered international attention, that Sweden is, in fact, heading for a systemic breakdown: Most people seem to think we cannot maintain a system where perhaps 190,000 people will arrive every year. In the long run, our system will collapse. This welcome is not going to receive popular support. We want to give people who come here a worthy reception. Symptomatic of Swedish journalists, this statement was tucked away at the end of the article. The headline was about how the political party that is critical of immigration, the Sweden Democrats Party (Sverigedemokraterna), is responsible for the asylum-housing fires. But foreign media, such as The Daily Mail and Russia Today, picked up Wallstr m s warning about a systemic collapse and ran it as the urgent news it actually is.Nevertheless, in official Sweden, the imminent collapse is ignored. Instead, journalists exclusively focus on attacks by supposedly  racist  Swedes on refugee centers. To prevent new fires, the Immigration Service decided on October 28 that from now on, all asylum facilities would have secret addresses. And meager police resources will now be stretched even further   to protect asylum seekers. Police helicopters will even patrol refugee centers. But considering there are only five helicopters available, and that Sweden s landmass is 407,340 square km (157,274 square miles), this gesture is effectively empty.At a meeting with the Nordic Council in Reykjavik, Iceland, on October 27, Sweden s Prime Minister, Stefan L fven, was questioned by his Nordic colleagues about the situation in Sweden. L fven had recently said that,  We should have the option of relocating people applying for asylum in Sweden to other EU-countries. Our ability, too, has a limit. We are facing a paradigm shift.  That comment led a representative of Finland s Finns Party (Sannfinl ndarna) to wonder, with a hint of irony, how mass immigration to Sweden, which for years Swedish politicians have touted as being so profitable, has now suddenly become a burden.Another Finns Party representative, Simon Elo, pointed out that the situation in Sweden is out of control.  Sweden has great abilities, but not even the Swedes have abilities that great,  Elo said.When L fven was asked how he is dealing with the real concerns and demands of the citizenry, his answer was laconic:  Of course I understand there is concern,  L fven said.  It is not easy. But at the same time   there are 60 million people on the run. This is also about them being our fellow men, and I hope that viewpoint will prevail. The daily tabloid Expressen asked L fven about the attacks on asylum facilities. He replied,  Our communities should not be characterized by threats and violence, they should be warm and show solidarity. As if such behavior can be forced.Many Swedes see mass immigration as a forced marriage: Sweden is forced to marry a man she did not choose, yet she is expected to love and honor him even though he beats her and treats her badly. And on top of that, her parents (the government) tell her to be warm and show solidarity with him.More and more Swedish commentators are now drawing the same conclusion: that Sweden is teetering on the brink of collapse. Editorial columnist Ivar Arpi of the daily Svenska Dagbladet, wrote an astonishing article on October 26, about a woman named Alexandra von Schwerin and her husband. The couple lives on the Skarhults Estate farm in Sk ne in southern Sweden; they have been robbed three times. Most recently, they were robbed of a quad bike, a van and a car. When the police arrived, von Schwerin asked them what she should do. The police told her that they could not help her.  All our resources are on loan to the asylum reception center in Trelleborg and Malm ,  they said.  We are overloaded right now. So I suggest you get in touch with the vigilante group in Esl v. What the police had called a  vigilante group  turned out to be a group of private business owners. In 2013, after being robbed more or less every night, they had decided to come together and start patrolling the area themselves. Currently, they pay a security firm to watch their facilities. On principal, I am totally against it,  von Schwerin said.  What are the people who cannot afford private security to do? They will be unprotected. I m sure I will join, but very, very reluctantly. For the first time, I feel scared to live here now. Are the State and I now in agreement that our mutual contract is being renegotiated? Commenting on the police s encouraging people to join vigilante groups, social commentator and former Refugee Ombudsman Merit Wager wrote: So, the Swedes are supposed to arrange and pay for their own and their families  security and keep their farms from being subjected to theft, even though that has up to now been included in the social contract   for which we pay high taxes, to have police we can count on to protect us and apprehend criminals?! When did the social contract expire? October 2015? Without any notice of termination, since the tax-consuming party is not fulfilling its part of the deal? This should mean that our part of the deal   to pay taxes for public, joint services   has also become invalid? If the social contract is broken, it is broken. Then it is musical chairs (lawlessness, defenselessness, without protection), and that means that each and every one of us should pay less taxes. Ilan Sad , lawyer and social commentator, wrote about the refugee chaos at Malm  Central Train Station on the blog Det Goda Samh llet on October 27:  The authorities no longer honor the social contract.  He described four large signs on display around the station that read  Refugee? Welcome to Malm !  in four different languages. It is unclear who the sender of the message is, or, for that matter, who is in charge of the reception facility   a number of barracks by the old post office in the inner harbor. Everything is utterly confusing. It could be Malm  City or the Immigration Service, but it might as well be  Refugees Welcome,  or possibly a religious community. I think to myself that a government agency could not reasonably write like this, a correct and pertinent sign would say something like:  Asylum seekers are referred to the barracks for information and further transport.  But I am probably wrong; Malm  City is the chief suspect communicant.   The signs in and around the Central Station are symptoms of something incredibly serious: Role confusion and the decay of the constitutional state. And thus, that our authorities no longer honor the social contract. In a post called Anarchy, blogger Johan Westerholm, who is a Social Democratic Party member and a critic of the government, wrote that the Minister for Justice and Migration, Morgan Johansson, is now urging authorities to  be pragmatic  about laws and regulations (concerning asylum housing for so-called unaccompanied refugee children). Westerholm stated that this is tantamount to the government  opening the gates to anarchy : Our country is founded on law; Parliament legislates and the courts apply these. Morgan Johansson s statement and his otherwise passive approach are testimony to how this, our kind of democracy, may fade into a memory very shortly. He now laid the first brick in the building of a state that rests on other principles. Anarchism. If anarchy really does break out, it would be good to remember that there are nearly two million licensed firearms in Sweden. Sweden s shooting clubs have seen a surge in interest; many are welcoming a lot of new members lately. Via: Gatestone Institute",Government News,"Dec 19, 2015",1
Lebanon's president rejects terrorism suggestion,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Lebanese president appeared to defend Hezbollah as necessary to resist Israel on Monday, after an Arab League statement accused the group of terrorism and noted it is part of Lebanon s coalition government.   Israeli targeting still continues and it is the right of the Lebanese to resist it and foil its plans by all available means,  President Michel Aoun s office quoted him as saying in a Tweet.  The heavily armed Shi ite Muslim Hezbollah, formed by Iran s Revolutionary Guards, fought Israel s occupation of Lebanon in the early 1980s and says its weapons are still needed against Israel.  Saudi Arabia, a regional rival of Iran, opposes Hezbollah s role as a military force in Syria and has accused it of helping the Houthi group in Yemen and militants in Bahrain.      The Arab League met on Sunday to discuss what it called Iranian interference in Arab countries, and accused Tehran s ally Hezbollah of terrorism.  Aoun said that Lebanon could not accept suggestions that its government was a partner in acts of terrorism, another Tweet quoted him as saying after meeting Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit in Beirut.  Aboul Gheit said in Beirut that nobody was accusing Lebanon s government of terrorism or wanted to harm Lebanon.   One of the ruling partners is accused of this...It is an indirect means of asking the Lebanese state to talk to this partner and convince them to restrain their acts on Arab land,  he said.  Everyone acknowledges the particularity of the Lebanese situation.   Lebanon faces a political crisis after its prime minister Saad al-Hariri suddenly resigned on Nov. 4 in a statement broadcast from Saudi Arabia. His resignation statement accused Iran and Hezbollah of  sowing strife  in Arab countries.  ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",0
 Trump Throws Twitter Tantrum Bashing Republicans For Not Taking Healthcare Away From People Fast Enough,"Donald Trump went on a tirade on Friday morning because Republicans in Congress are not stripping healthcare from millions of Americans fast enough.For months, Trump has failed to get an Obamacare repeal bill on his desk because Americans overwhelmingly oppose it because they now realize that the Affordable Care Act keeps them insured, and in many cases, alive.The Trumpcare bill that has been hitting roadblock after roadblock in Congress strips healthcare from millions of Americans, drops coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, makes healthcare premiums more expensive, and takes away vital care for women and children among a slew of other important provisions, all so that the wealthy can get a massive tax cut.While in France on Bastille Day, Trump whined on Twitter that Republicans are not moving fast enough to repeal healthcare.Republicans Senators are working hard to get their failed ObamaCare replacement approved.

"Talks to form NZ coalition govt start, no decision until after final count","WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand First Party leader Winston Peters began talks on Thursday with the governing National Party and opposition Labour Party aimed at forming a coalition government after last month s inconclusive election. Peters, whose nationalist party holds the balance of power, has said no decision will be made until after a final vote count is released on Saturday.  It s like being between the devil and the deep blue sea here,  Peters told reporters at Parliament, according to the New Zealand Herald.  Peters held talks with Prime Minister Bill English and members of his center-right National in the morning and an afternoon meeting with Labour leader Jacinda Ardern, who told local media the conversation was  a great start .  It s setting the agenda, the ground rules, the protocols, how we re going to go about it. Let s have an agreement about precisely how we re going to do this,  Peters said in a video posted on Fairfax Media. English s National Party won a 10-point lead over center-left Labour in the Sept. 23 election, but neither won enough seats to govern alone. This is the third time Peters, 72, has held the balance of power after an election and he has previously formed coalitions with both National and Labour. A complete count is due on Oct. 7 when  special votes  which make up 15 percent of the total and include overseas ballots are released. The final count is not expected to change the outcome. Peters has said he will make a final decision by Oct. 12. Observers said Peters  focus in talks will likely be on domestic policies, especially regional development to shore up his voter base, despite his rhetoric about limiting Asian investment and slashing immigration.  Regional development is surely going to figure highly...I think there s no doubt New Zealand First is shifting to be more of a provincial, country party and that the important points are going to be directly related to that development,  said Bryce Edwards, political analyst at Critical Politics in Wellington. In one of the only indications of his priorities going into negotiations, Peters this week promised to revive the country s forestry sector, which has been a hot topic in his remote home region in the country s far north. Peters plans to create state-owned forests and a quota system to favor local processors over those exporting logs to overseas, largely to China. ",worldnews,"October 4, 2017 ",0
Swedish Mother KICKS Daughter Out Of Her Room To House Refugee…Refugee Promptly Sexually Assaults 10 Year Old Daughter,"A tale of a mother and the dangerous religion of progressivism Putting her radical liberal ideology before the safety and well-being of her own children A Swedish mother decided it would be a good idea to open up her home to a male refugee from Eritrea, and so she kicked her daughter out of her room to make space. That refugee then decided to sexually assault her 10-year-old daughter.In the summer of 2015, a mother of three children in Sweden brought two third world asylum seekers into her home. To make space, she decided to move her daughter Emma into her own room.On the eve of Aug. 18, 2015, Emma awoke to find Isaac squeezing her chest. She suffered breast pain after the incident and didn t want to tell anyone, as she was afraid her mother would get in trouble. Emma couldn t even look at Isaac because  he looked scary to her. The story came out after Emma finally told a friend of hers, and eventually after several people became aware of the situation, Isaac was confronted.He protested he would never sexually assault Emma, since he has a girlfriend back in Eritrea. But after further questioning, he finally admitted to groping Emma s breasts. When the police questioned him, Isaac changed his testimony and denied he had ever touched her.Isaac meanwhile maintains he s only 15, since he started school in Eritrea when he was 10 and then went to school for an additional seven years. He finished school two years ago, which according to him, makes him only 15.The Lund District Court finds this sort of calculation bizarre, but the judge has decided to move forward with the case under the assumption that he is, in fact, just 15. The judge sentenced Isaac on Friday based on the charge of juvenile sexual assault, which means he ll be sent to counseling.In the counseling process, he ll apparently learn to control his impulses and process through past experiences in his life that may have caused him to act out the way he did.Meanwhile, Emma s brother says he s never seen his sister so distraught. She cries often, even though according to her brother, she s very strong.Yet, despite what Isaac did, he ll be able to stay in Sweden.Via: Daily Caller ",left-news,"May 9, 2016",1
Trump administration to review dozens of U.S. national monuments,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday will order a review of national monuments created over the past 20 years with an aim toward rescinding or resizing some of them - part of a broader push to reopen areas to drilling, mining and other development. The move comes as Trump seeks to reverse a slew of environmental protections ushered in by former President Barack Obama that he said were hobbling economic growth - an agenda that is cheering industry but enraging conservationists. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke told reporters on Tuesday Trump’s executive order would require him to conduct the review of around 30 national monuments and recommend which designations should be lifted or resized over the coming months. He said he would seek feedback from Congressional delegations, governors and local stakeholders before making his recommendations. “I am not going to predispose what the outcome is going to be,” Zinke said. Rescinding or altering a national monument designation would be new ground for the government, he said. “It is untested, as you know, whether the president can do that,” Zinke said. The monuments covered by the review will range from the Grand Staircase in Utah created by President Bill Clinton in 1996 to the Bears Ears monuments created by President Barack Obama in December 2016 in the same state, covering millions of acres of land overlying minerals, oil and gas.  Obama’s administration created the Bears Ears monument arguing that it would protect the cultural legacy of the Navajo and four other tribes and preserve “scenic and historic landscapes.” But Utah’s governor opposed the designation, saying it went against the wishes of citizens eager for development. The area lies near where EOG Resources (EOG.N) - a Texas-based company - had been approved to drill. Zinke said the broader aim of the order is to give states more input in the monument designation process, and “restore trust between local communities and Washington.” While he acknowledged that national monuments could bring tourism, he said he thinks federal land should be managed for “multiple uses.”  Conservation groups and Native American tribal representatives slammed the looming order, suggesting it would be fought in court. “With this review, the Trump Administration is walking into a legal, political and moral minefield,” said Kate Kelly, public lands director for the Center for American Progress.  A summary of the forthcoming order, seen by Reuters, said past administrations “overused” the Antiquities Act that allows presidents to create monuments. ",politicsNews,"April 26, 2017 ",0
 Chelsea Clinton Teaches Trump How To Treat The White House With Respect,"Donald Trump insulted the  People s House,  so Chelsea Clinton subtly ripped him a new one for it.During a recent outing to his Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump told members that the White House  is a real dump. The insult outraged Americans across the country. No president should talk about the White House that way. It s disrespectful, especially to the people charged with preserving it and keeping up the maintenance, which is paid for by American taxpayers.Trump is probably mad because the decor doesn t feature gold-plated walls like his penthouse at Trump Tower.But the White House has a history. It was burned by the British during the War of 1812. But we rebuilt it. Years of neglect and failure to update the historic residence resulted in the biggest overhaul during the Truman presidency. The White House was gutted and Truman was forced to take up residence across the street until the renovation was complete.Today, the White House stands as a magnificent mansion that honors the past while continually updating to remain equipped with the latest technology. Sometimes, it s hard to keep up, but the White House staff does the best they can.Trump s remark was off the cuff to people who paid to be around him. He probably thought his comment would be off the record, which means he said exactly what he meant to say.But Chelsea Clinton was not amused by Trump s insult. And she proceeded to school him on Twitter for it.Thank you to all the White House ushers, butlers, maids, chefs, florists, gardeners, plumbers, engineers & curators for all you do every day https://t.co/rjQS9HeALG  Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) August 1, 2017This is what Trump should have said. This is how a grateful and unspoiled person acts. Trump is used to excess and flaunting his wealth. He has no idea what it means to live in an ordinary household. To him, the White House is a step down, and that is truly insulting. So much so, that he should resign and move out if he hates being there so much.Back in May, Trump bragged to Time Magazine that he s the  certain type of person  who sees the beauty of the White House. People have no idea the beauty of the White House. The real beauty of the White House,  he said.That was clearly a lie Trump told the media to make himself look good. Get him around his golf buddies and he ll blurt out how he really feels.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"August 2, 2017",1
Certain flight crew barred from U.S. entry after Trump order: IATA memo,"(Reuters) - A new ban on U.S. travel for nationals of seven Middle Eastern countries caught the airline industry unprepared, with flight crew from those states also barred from entering, the International Air Transport Association said on Saturday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has briefed the global trade group that passport-holders from states such as Iran and Iraq, including cabin crew, will be barred entry to the United States, IATA said in an email to its member airlines, seen by Reuters. The email underscores airlines’ confusion about the situation as well as the challenge some may face from crew scheduling. Airlines also stand to lose business: for instance, around 35,000 travelers from Iran visited the United States in 2015, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. “Much of this development has come over the weekend and at a time when IATA’s Facilitation team has been on duty travel.  Unfortunately, our response has been slower than we would have preferred,” the email said. “A number (of questions) have yet to be resolved.” The executive order by President Donald Trump bans travelers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. IATA was informed that lawful permanent residents of the United States - or green-card holders - from those countries are not included in the ban. However, a Trump administration official told reporters that green-card holders from the countries need to check with a U.S. consulate to see whether they can return, causing some confusion for airlines, which still plan to follow CBP guidance. Gulf airlines Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways said earlier on their websites that passengers would need a green card or diplomatic visa to enter the United States. An Emirates spokeswoman said “a very small number” of its passengers had been affected by the ban. ",politicsNews,"January 29, 2017 ",0

However, Simmons made it perfectly clear that he didn t think Trump was a  suitable person for the presidency.  In expressing how unqualified Trump was to run the country, Simmons was candid about the racist and anti-semitic comments he heard and witnessed Trump make over the last three decades. Simmons said: People carry beliefs that are hurtful, none of us are enlightened   I would laugh off things he said that were off-color, that kind of didn t represent my viewpoints. Certainly, I heard things that seemed a little racist. Simmons observed that Trump s remarks, which were often times Islamophobic and anti-black, could have devastating consequences on the country. He said: The fear is that his statements would take people who would never even admit to having those seeds of hate in them, and water those seeds, and then those people would say things they wouldn t even imagine saying, and then it became the norm.

 Samantha Bee: N.C.’s ‘Numbnut’ Anti-Gay Law Is Due To Dems Not Voting (VIDEO),"We all know what an absolute shitstorm is happening with regards to LGBT rights in North Carolina right now. Everyone is focusing on the idiot Gov. Pat McCrory and his bullshit lawsuit against the Department of Justice over his anti-LGBT hate bill, HB2. However, there is another side to what brought this on, and Full Frontal host Samantha Bee is pointing it out. You see, when an election has high voter turnout, Democrats win. When it s a low turnout, we get imbeciles like Pat McCrory elected. Bee began her tirade: Boycotts are a powerful tool   but you know what is a more powerful tool? Not electing a bunch of transphobic numbnuts who are going to wreck the state economy to catch a nonexistent criminal. Bee is right, of course. Thanks to the homophobic and transphobic HB2, bunches of businesses and musicians have pulled out of North Carolina. Bee insists that what we are seeing right now is a direct result of Democrats not voting in the 2010 election. She continues, referencing times prior to that fateful election night: It was a blue-state dream. Democrats controlled the Governor s mansion and legislature, welfare checks grew on trees and there was an abortion in every pot. But all that changed on Election Night 2010. Bee then went on to show tape of references to the newly-GOP controlled North Carolina legislature slashing education funding and said, You know North Carolina s world-class public university? F*ck that place. Bee then goes on to remind everyone that it could be progressive college students who would vote these morons out, but there s just one problem with that: right-wingers have used their time in office to suppress the votes of college students by making laws that take polling places off campuses and deny students the right to use their student identification cards to vote: I bet UNC students can t wait to vote those right-wing boobs out of office. Well, sorry, those boobs are actually way ahead of you on that. The host then points out the fact that the GOP now controlled more states than they have since 1928, and as a result, their insane laws have swept the nation in more than just North Carolina. She goes on to say: After the 2010 landslide, policies started happening to states the way sex happens to people who drink with Bill Cosby. No wonder Democrats are so hung up on appointing the next Supreme Court Justice. They need him to strike down all the sh*tty state laws that might not have passed if they d bothered to vote in 2010. Bee s closer is absolutely brilliant, and oh so true: Look, I know state elections aren t fun. They don t have cool concerts or dank memes. But, voting in them is important. Just think of it like a mammogram. It s painful and inconvenient, but you gotta do it. Because early prevention prevents a lot less than late stage treatment. Samantha Bee is spot-on with this one. Liberals didn t vote in midterm elections, and therefore the GOP has been able to go on a nationwide right-wing tear the likes of which we have not seen for many decades. Listen to this wise woman, people. When Democrats don t vote, this dangerous, regressive nonsense is what we all must suffer through.

 Being Transgender Could Soon Mean You’re A Sex Offender In Arkansas If GOPer Gets Her Way,"Some people like to create solutions to problems that just simply do not exist, and this time around it s a  solution  to a non-existent problem that insinuates individuals who are transgender are somehow sex abusers or pedophiles and are sneaking into restrooms to harm people. We re seeing transphobic legislation in North Carolina, and now Arkansas looks to be trying to add to the discriminatory hate.These legislative actions are nothing but hate, because laws already exist on the books that don t allow assault or intrusion of privacy. These laws and proposals are just purely anti-transgender bigotry.That doesn t seem to be stopping Republican Arkansas State Senator Missy Irvin, who, according to a blog at Arktimes.com: Looks like Sen.

" Oklahoma Gun Range Refused Service To Muslim Man, Now He’s Giving Them What They Deserve","You d think in the year 2016 we d no longer have to deal with discrimination of this magnitude anymore, but alas, the nation is still filled with bigoted morons, so, we still have businesses refusing service to customers based upon, in this case, religion.The Oktaha, Oklahoma gun range  Save Yourself Survival and Tactical Gun Range  (what a name) decided to prohibit 29-year-old Raja ee Fatihah from their establishment because he s a Muslim. And now the U.S Army reservist, who proudly serves his country despite being openly discriminated against by bigots, is throwing a much-deserved lawsuit back in their face.The gun range, quite openly, prohibits Muslims, as can be seen in the photo:Save Yourself Survival and Tactical Gun Range via CAIRLittle did they realize that the person whom they banned from their establishment was none other than a board member in the Oklahoma chapter of the Muslim advocacy group, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is the one who helped file the suit, and the legal director of the Oklahoma chapter, Brady Henderson perfectly stated: Whether the sign in question says  no Muslims  or whether it says  no coloreds  or whether it says  no women  or  no Christians  or  no Buddhists    it is just as un-American and fundamentally it is just as wrong. Fatihah said the range was fine and pleasant with him until he revealed that he was, in fact, Muslim. He said: At that point, they started treating me with suspicion. The ACLU released this as part of their press release: The lawsuit alleges that the policy violates Oklahoma s non-discrimination law as well as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which forbids certain places of business from denying service to customers based on their race, color, religion, or national origin. Although the business is open to the general public, in July 2015, the owners posted a sign near the front entrance announcing that Muslims are not permitted at the facility and that the business is a  Muslim free establishment. There is no justification for a business denying people service based on religion,  said Fatihah.  I am a servant of my community in every respect, and as a proud American, I have enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve to protect this country. I should be afforded the same rights and privileges as anyone else. When Fatihah arrived at the business s main counter, owners required him to fill out a liability form and provide his name, address, and driver s license number  standard procedure for patrons seeking to use the gun range s facilities. However, after Fatihah identified himself as a Muslim, the owners armed themselves with handguns and demanded to know whether he was there to  commit an act of violence or as part of a  jihad.  Fatihah was then made to leave the gun range without receiving service.

Donors to White House hopeful Jeb Bush urged not to switch to Rubio,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donors say Republican Jeb Bush’s U.S. presidential campaign has not given them a green light to switch to rival establishment candidate Marco Rubio, whose strong third-place finish in this week’s Iowa caucuses outshone the sixth-place Bush.   A former Florida governor, Bush, 62, is hoping for a better result in New Hampshire, the state which on Tuesday will hold the country’s second nominating contest for the Nov. 8 election to succeed President Barack Obama. U.S. Senator Rubio, 44, also of Florida, emerged as the leading moderate, establishment Republican candidate in Iowa, behind U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, 45, and billionaire businessman Donald Trump, 69.  Senior campaign officials for Bush have been seeking to reassure donors that the one-time front-runner has a path forward after his dismal Iowa showing, three Bush donors told Reuters. They said senior aides to Bush held conference calls for donors on Tuesday to reassure them, offering an upbeat message about Bush’s finances and ground game in New Hampshire and a determination to press on.     Rubio began the year with more than $10 million in cash on hand, his campaign reported on Sunday. Bush reported cash on hand as of Sunday of $7.6 million. Bush, campaigning later this week in New Hampshire with his mother, former first lady Barbara Bush, has benefited from the intense loyalty donors have shown his father and brother, former presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. The donors said there was no indication Bush would shy away from contrasting himself with either Rubio or Cruz.     “People who are for Jeb are for Jeb,” one donor said. On the campaign trail this week Bush has questioned the abilities of freshman U.S. senators - both Rubio and Cruz are first-term senators - by saying they lacked his proven record.

Top Mexico university blames deadly bridge collapse on weak supports,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico s elite Tecnologico de Monterrey university said on Friday that structural shortcomings contributed to the collapse of walkways on its Mexico City campus in an earthquake last month, killing five college students. Rashid Abella Yunes, the school s vice-president for the Mexico City region, told Reuters that examinations showed two sets of pedestrian bridges stretching between three buildings were too weak to withstand the Sept. 19 quake that toppled dozens of buildings and killed nearly 230 people in the capital.  The supports that were supporting the bridges were just 15 centimeters, which to the judgment of experts could have been larger,  he said.  The buildings made the bridges lose support, and they fell.   Abella added that the university was leaving to Mexico City prosecutors the task of determining if any of the architects, contractors or inspectors that it hired between 1991 and 1998 to build the bridges could be held responsible.  None of the professionals that Abella said worked on the bridges were immediately reachable for comment. Construction and safety documents published last month by the Tlalpan district, where the campus is located, included an August 2017 structural safety certificate. Abella also said that Mexico City s construction regulations do not specify the size that bridge supports need to be in order be structurally sound.   The university, renowned for its engineering program, attributed its findings to Mexico City-based engineering firm Garcia Jarque Ingenieros, which it hired to investigate the collapse.   A group of nearly 100 alumni have been pressing the school to explain how the bridges were constructed.  Of all of the doubts that we ve had, none are resolved,  said Carlos Brito, a 2010 graduate. Family members of two students who died at the site said their children were crushed by falling bridges as they raced out of the ground-floor cafeteria beneath.  Juan Carlos Alvarez Blanco said his son, 19-year-old engineering student Juan Carlos, decided to stay on campus for lunch and died attempting to exit the cafeteria.  We want facts,  he said last week.  Along with the other four families, we are very, very devastated.   A relative of another student who died, who asked to not be named, said the young man, who studied engineering, had also been in the cafeteria.   Both family members declined to provide further comment on Friday. ",worldnews,"October 28, 2017 ",0

 Trump LOVES To Bash Second Place Finishers And The Internet Couldn’t Wait To Remind Him,"Donald Trump came in second place in the Iowa caucus, and while it may not seem like a bad position to be in, it s a disaster for his campaign. Trump has always positioned himself as a  winner  and painted everyone lower than him in the polls as  losers.  He used his supposed popularity in the polls to justify all manner of nasty hate speech and shameful policies. His entire candidacy is hinged on him being the  best.  And he just lost.Second place might as well be last place. And nobody seems to believe that more than Donald Trump   and the internet couldn t wait to remind him about it.During Trump s long, mind-numbing, career on Twitter, he s repeatedly recycled a favorite quote of his from Walter Hagen: No one remembers who came in second. He tweeted it in 2013, and liked it so much that he then tweeted it again in 2014.Needless to say, the silly message stuck in people s minds, especially tonight when Trump found himself falling short to his rival Ted Cruz by a considerable margin. He may very well become the second place finisher that no one remembers.LOVE THIS QUOTE Cited by The Donald, Especially Tonight: Think It'll Haunt His Campaign? #IowaCaucus #uspoli #Iowa pic.twitter.com/zGOt7GiUib  Jim Harris (@JimHarris) February 2, 2016It will be fascinating to see how Trump handles losing. If history is any indication, he ll react very poorly. Throughout his campaign, we ve seen that any time his poll numbers started to slide or another candidate started to emerge as a threat, Trump has lashed out with ugly aggression. In a telling example, Trump was very friendly with Cruz when Cruz had no chance, but as he established himself, Trump quickly turned on him   even going full-birther on the Canadian born senator.Even more embarrassing for Trump, his  No one remembers who came in second  tweet began going viral.

Latest House healthcare bill includes concessions to conservatives: Politico,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The latest version of a House Republican bill to replace Obamacare would limit who could receive tax credits to help purchase health insurance, Politico reported on Monday, in an effort to secure the support of the chamber’s conservative wing.  Congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump have repeatedly promised to repeal and replace former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement but have publicly disagreed about the best way to do so. The House of Representatives is expected to unveil its legislation soon.  Under a Feb. 10 draft of the legislation made available to several news outlets, Republicans proposed offering an age-based refundable tax credit regardless of income level. That was resisted by conservatives who called it another entitlement program. Critics also said extremely wealthy people would receive the credit even though they do not need it.  In the most recent version of the bill, the tax credits would only be available to those within certain income levels, according to Politico. They would start to phase out for individuals earning $75,000 and households earning $150,000, and would be unavailable for individuals who earn more than $215,000, Politico reported.  Republicans had also initially proposed capping exemptions on employer-provided health coverage, a provision that drew the ire of some conservatives who said the bill would remove Obamacare’s taxes only to replace it with another.  According to Politico, the latest version of the bill would not include a cap. The bill also delays repealing several of Obamacare’s taxes until 2018, a year later than initially proposed, Politico reported.  ",politicsNews,"March 6, 2017 ",0
Tillerson seeks to ease skepticism about U.S. State Department reorganization,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Rex Tillerson, dogged by media speculation about how long he will last as U.S. secretary of state, tried on Tuesday to ease skepticism among staff about his leadership and planned State Department reorganization. Tillerson has alienated some staff by relying on a narrow group of aides while nudging out some of the department’s most senior foreign service officials, and for making erroneous statements about the top echelon of U.S. diplomats during a recent appearance. During a town hall meeting at the State Department, the chief U.S. diplomat laid out steps such as merging agency email lists, allowing more telecommuting for employees and partially easing a hiring freeze as part of his effort to win over workers unhappy about previously announced plans to reduce staff and to carry out the White House’s proposed 30 percent budget cuts. Tillerson did not break new ground in his speech on policy challenges such as the North Korean and Iranian nuclear programs, Syria’s civil war and Russia’s occupation of Crimea. Among the organizational steps he laid out were moving to cloud-based systems for email and collaboration; integrating the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development email address lists; and ending a hiring freeze on “eligible family members” of employees. Many State Department officials have been frustrated by the hiring freeze on such family members because this means their spouses are often unable to work at U.S. embassies. The State Department said its wider hiring freeze would remain for now. Tillerson also announced plans to allow workers abroad who are evacuated for medical reasons to telecommute; to streamline the process of obtaining security clearances, including allowing interns to work with “interim” clearances; and to simplify the department’s computer system interfaces. Tillerson aides have said they need to make a stronger case about the reorganization. While the initiatives that he announced drew some applause, five of six State Department officials interviewed about his remarks said they did not think the town hall would do much to ease skepticism about Tillerson or his reorganization plans. “It’s too little too late,” said one official who spoke on condition of anonymity. President Donald Trump has undercut Tillerson on issues such as North Korea, where the president said the secretary of state was wasting his time pursuing diplomacy. Tillerson’s inaccurate statements about the title and ages of some the State Department’s recently retired top officials have rankled some of his staff and suggested that his grasp of the agency’s inner workings is limited. “It’s one of many things that show that the administration as a whole doesn’t fundamentally understand what diplomacy can do and how it works,” Richard Boucher, a former assistant secretary for South and Central Asia, said on Monday.

"Big security risks in Trump feud with spy agencies, officials say","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An unprecedented pre-presidential inauguration feud between Donald Trump and intelligence agencies that soon will be under his command could harm U.S. security if not quickly defused, current and former government officials said. They said morale at the CIA and other agencies was already sagging because of disputes with Trump over whether Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered interference in the U.S. election and over leaks about an unsubstantiated dossier compiled by a private security firm suggesting Moscow had compromising information on Trump. Unless addressed, the disputes could prompt the departure of personnel and lead those who remain to take fewer risks to counter security threats, the officials said. In the last few months, Trump has expressed his willingness to deal with Putin and denigrated the work of the intelligence agencies. This week, the President-elect accused agencies of leaking the dossier’s information to the media, but Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said he did not believe intelligence officials were responsible for the leak. “People shooting at (the CIA) is pretty common. But usually it’s not the president,” one former senior U.S. official said. Trump’s transition team did not reply to email messages seeking comment. “I think it’s a recipe for disaster,” said Daniel Benjamin, who served in senior White House and State Department counter-terrorism posts under Democratic presidents. Benjamin, now at Dartmouth College, said there was a “strong chance” people would leave and they have “tremendous value” to the private sector. Complicating the situation just a week before Republican Trump is sworn in, two of his nominees for top security posts set a different tone at their Senate confirmation hearings, heaping praise on the men and women who work in the secret world of intelligence gathering. Republican congressman Mike Pompeo, nominee for Central Intelligence Agency director, said on Thursday that he has seen  CIA personnel “walk through fire.” Separately, Trump’s nominee for U.S. defense secretary, James Mattis, told senators that he had a “very, very high degree of confidence” in U.S. intelligence agencies.  Mattis also put Russia at the top of a list of threats to U.S. interests. A top official at one intelligence agency said a growing number of intelligence officers over the age of 50 and with at least 20 years of service, including at least five years overseas, have drafted and in many cases signed but not dated their resignation letters. “There is great anxiety here about the President-elect’s apparent disdain for the work we do and the dangers we face,”   a second senior intelligence official, at another agency, said. He and others spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters and morale at their agencies. The latest round of rancor began with a CNN report that Trump had been briefed Jan. 6 by intelligence and law enforcement chiefs on a two-page memo summarizing the unverified claims in the dossier. In blaming intelligence agencies for the leak, Trump wrote on Twitter: “One last shot at me. Are we living in Nazi Germany?” Spy chief Clapper called Trump before dinnertime on Wednesday to calm the waters. Trump and Clapper differed on what was said in the phone conversation. On Friday, Trump appeared to again blame U.S. spies for the leak. “Probably released by ‘intelligence’ even knowing there is no proof and never will be,” he said on Twitter. U.S. intelligence agency personnel “are kind of shell-shocked at being accused of being Nazis and intentionally leaking this stuff,” the former senior official said. The 17 U.S. intelligence agencies have combined budgets of more than $70 billion and tens of thousands of employees. They are responsible for everything from warning of terrorist attacks to supporting American troops on the battlefield and analyzing the impacts of global trends such as climate change. Several former U.S. officials said the tensions with Trump were the worst they could recall since President George W. Bush and the CIA traded blame in 2003 and 2004 over the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  But Douglas Wise, a former senior CIA official, said it will be harder for Trump to “beat up” on his own intelligence chiefs once they are in place instead of officials appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama. “I think things are going to change,” Wise said. Still, tensions seem likely to persist after Inauguration Day on Jan. 20. Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who will be Trump’s national security adviser, led the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency until he was fired by Clapper. He has a long-time suspicion of the CIA, according to Wise and others who have worked with him. “What Pompeo said was somewhat reassuring, but it’s not at all clear whether that matters, or whether Trump’s apparent attitude and Flynn’s bitterness toward us is what counts,” the second senior intelligence official said.

 Sarah Palin Removes Offensive Tweet After Being Humiliated For Whining About A Black Man Donating To Charity,"The overwhelming response to her temper tantrum was so humiliating that Sarah Palin removed the outrageous tweet.Just after midnight on Wednesday morning, Palin apparently learned that former San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick donated money to Meals on Wheels.Palin has relentlessly targeted Kaepernick because he exercised his freedom to kneel during the national anthem in protest of police brutality against people of color.Kaepernick is currently a free agent and will likely find a new team before the next NFL season begins, but that didn t stop Palin from gloating about his current status.In response to Donald Trump s draconian budget that slashes funding for Meals on Wheels, a program that helps millions of senior citizens get a meal and a well-being check every day from a volunteer, Kaepernick donated $50,000 to the organization.For some reason, Palin has a problem with this and she threw a mini hissy fit on Twitter complete with a link to a story on her own website.Palin soon deleted the offensive tweet and we ll get to the reason why shortly, however, a screenshot was obtained by a Twitter user.Since she deleted her tweet, here s the screengrab where she mocks Kaepernick for donating to Meals on Wheels. pic.twitter.com/yPFYgR23zu  Rey  Azure  McSriff (@aguyuno) March 22, 2017As you can see, Palin mocked Kaepernick for currently not having a job, even though there are still quite a few months before the next NFL season begins and free agency is part of the game.Palin linked to story on her website that called Kaepernick s donation a purely  political stunt. You know, because Palin doesn t believe Kaepernick is capable of such a generous gesture out of the kindness of his heart.The article has also been removed.And that s because Palin was buried under such an avalanche of humiliation that she was forced to do so.In particular, Twitter users pointed out that Palin herself does not have a job. She s a mere grifter who quit her previous job as Governor of Alaska because it was easier to swindle money out of her gullible fans.imagine being so racist you get mad a black athlete for donating to meals on wheels https://t.co/wIEa4RBK3s  Adam H.

"Factbox: End deportations, reform tax code. What a President Clinton would do","(Reuters) - Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton has moved to the left in key policy areas such as trade during her primary campaign against rival U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is known for his liberal stances. Here is a look at what the former secretary of state has said she would do should she win the White House in the Nov. 8 election. These policies are drawn from white papers released by her campaign, stump speeches, debates and interviews. Clinton supports comprehensive immigration reform with a path to full citizenship. She has pledged to defend President Barack Obama’s executive actions on immigration and, if legally possible, expand on them. She has called for an end to deportation raids and family detentions.  Clinton has, however, disagreed with liberal Democrats about the best way to handle the influx of young people fleeing cartel violence and other issues in Central America.  Obama said in 2014 that the United States would send these youths back to deter others from attempting the same dangerous journey – a position that Clinton has defended, including in a recent presidential debate. “The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border,” Clinton said. “I think now what I’ve called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child, so that the right decision, hopefully, can be made.” Clinton supports some free-trade agreements and opposes others, saying her decisions are based on whether she feels the specific agreement will adequately protect the interests of U.S. workers.  Clinton has had to deal with the legacy of the North American Free Trade Agreement reached by her husband’s administration during her own political career. She backed away from NAFTA when she ran for a U.S. Senate seat representing New York.  As a senator, she supported trade agreements with Australia, Chile, Morocco, Oman and Singapore. She opposed the Central American Free Trade Agreement. During her first presidential campaign in 2008, she criticized possible agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea. But once she became Obama’s secretary of state, she worked to finalize agreements with Colombia and South Korea – a deal that in 2007 she had called “inherently unfair.” Clinton also worked on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) as secretary of state, saying it would be the “gold standard” of trade agreements.  As a presidential candidate in 2015, she stalled on taking a position on TPP, saying she would wait until it was finalized by the administration. Clinton eventually said she would not support TPP because it does not adequately protect U.S. workers. Clinton has pledged to not raise taxes on the middle class in any way, in contrast to Sanders, her Democratic rival, who favors a nominal income tax premium to fund universal healthcare. Clinton has focused on “reforming the tax code so the wealthiest pay their fair share.” She has proposed ending the carried interest loophole that categorizes the bulk of a hedge fund manager’s income as return on investment and not compensation; enacting the “Buffett Rule” so the wealthy with investment income do not pay lower effective tax rates than “truck drivers or nurses;” and pushing back against “quarterly capitalism” and incentivizing long-term investment by Wall Street. Clinton has called for an “intelligence surge” to combat the Islamic State militant group, and diplomatic efforts feature prominently in most of her foreign policy plans. She does not believe there should be a surge in ground troops in the Middle East, including in Syria. She has said she supports increased “specialized forces” there and enforcing a no-fly zone. She believes Russia’s participation will be essential for any solution in Syria. Clinton has also called for stepped-up efforts by U.S. technology companies to combat terrorism. In a major foreign policy speech she said “social media companies can also do their part by swiftly shutting down terrorist accounts so they are not used to plan, provoke or celebrate violence.” She has not said how far she would go to compel the cooperation of private companies in this effort.

 WATCH: Trump Supporters Believe These BIZARRE Campaign Ads Are Real (VIDEO),"During a segment of Triumph s Summer Election Special, Donald Trump supporters got trolled hard. A group of Trump supporters volunteered to be a part of a focus group. As far as the Trump supporters know, they have been selected to watch and review potential Trump campaign video advertisements.What they don t know is that the campaign ads they are watching are entirely fictional. The point of the prank is to test the supporter s loyalty to their chosen candidate.  We decided to assemble a group of them for an unfiltered view at how they connect with Trump s vision for America,  as Triumph the Insult Comedy Dog puts it.The phony ads they watch are rather extreme bizarre even. During the ad, a Trump impersonator says that they will build a giant electrified fence as a temporary way to keep  any illegals  out while they construct the real wall that Trump has promised to build if he is elected president.The people in the focus group also watch an ad where Trump calls out Hillary Clinton, demanding that she reveal to the world that she is a man pretending to be a woman.Another ad features Trump s solution to helping women feel more secure in bathrooms. Rather than banning transgender individuals from using the restroom, Trump will provide every woman who uses a public bathroom with a firearm.Spoiler alert: The Trump supporters totally fall for the gag, believing they are real. Now, it is important to keep in mind that research has shown that people tend to offer opinions about subjects that are ridiculous.

Sean Spicer, Trump s pick for White House press secretary, actually championed Trump s approach to disseminating information via Twitter by calling it a  direct pipeline to the American people.  Spicer also played up the  results  Trump gets when he tweets.Not everyone likes or appreciates this, and Trump has proven that his use of Twitter, now that he s actually been elected, is dangerous in several ways. Senator Chuck Schumer, the incoming Senate Minority Leader, absolutely destroyed Trump in a speech about it today: So, Mr. President, the issues facing this country are many  These issues are too important for mere words. Our challenge is too entrenched for mere tweeting. Making America great again requires more than 140 characters per issue. With all due respect, America cannot afford a Twitter presidency. We have real challenges and we have real needs to get things done. And many Americans are afraid, Mr. President-elect, that instead of rolling up your sleeves and forging serious policies, for you, Twitter suffices. In other words, Schumer just said what we re all thinking: Trump needs to buckle down instead of playing around on social media while avoiding real work. The presidency is a serious job and requires a serious head.To deal with the issues that Schumer lists in his speech creating jobs, raising incomes, making college and healthcare affordable, rebuilding our infrastructure, making trade laws work for American workers, keeping Americans safe from violence and terrorism, and taking care of our vets Trump actually has to work. He can t fuck around while everyone else tries to do his job for him. That s something he doesn t seem to get.Trump won t like any of this   especially since he recently said he likes Schumer more than many Congressional Republicans. Trump no doubt expects return favors for daring to say that.Trump uses Twitter to brag about things he s done, and also about things he hasn t done. He also uses it to blast individual companies for not doing exactly what he wants, when he wants, and sends their stocks tumbling. One of these days, those tumbles won t be temporary and he ll actually bankrupt someone with a single tweet.And that s assuming he doesn t get us into a nuclear war via his damned Twitter account. Schumer is right. We can t afford a Twitter presidency. We can t afford a president who does nothing and claims credit for every good thing that happens via Twitter. If Trump doesn t step up to the plate, someone else will have to.Watch this segment of Schumer s speech in full below:.@SenSchumer:  America cannot afford a Twitter presidency.

"After German election, Macron to set out his vision for Europe","PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron will set out plans for reforming the European Union on Tuesday, including proposals for a separate eurozone budget, despite a German election result that is likely to complicate his far-reaching ambitions. German Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives saw their support slide in Sunday s election, though they remain the biggest parliamentary bloc. She is expected to seek a coalition with the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) - who have criticized Macron s ideas for Europe - and the Greens. Elysee officials said Macron, who has promised sweeping reforms to Europe s monetary union in coordination with Merkel, hoped the issues to be raised in his speech would be taken into account in Germany s coalition negotiations. One Elysee official said a eurozone budget, one of Macron s most contentious ideas, would be  necessary in due course  and that the president would therefore raise the issue in his speech, to be delivered at the Sorbonne University in Paris. Since his election in May, Macron has made the overhaul of the EU and its institutions one of his major themes. As well as his eurozone budget idea, he wants to see the appointment of a eurozone finance minister and the creation of a rescue fund that would preemptively help countries facing economic trouble. Ahead of Sunday s election, Merkel had indicated her willingness to work with Macron on a reform agenda, even if her own ideas may not reach as far as his. But the election results have left Merkel facing a difficult coalition-building task which is in turn likely to limit her flexibility on Europe. A coalition of Merkel s CDU/CSU bloc, the FDP and the Greens is unprecedented at the national level - and any attempt by the chancellor and Macron to press for greater EU integration will face opposition from the new German lower house Bundestag. The FDP has called for a phasing out of Europe s ESM bailout fund and changes to EU treaties that would allow countries to leave the euro zone. And the far-right, eurosceptic Alternative for Germany is now the third biggest party in the Bundestag, further curbing Merkel s room for maneuver. But Elysee officials noted that the FDP had reaffirmed its attachment to the EU and to strong Franco-German relations, a point Macron was likely to emphasize in his speech while at the same time not seeking to impose anything on his partners. Macron, the sources said, would propose that the whole EU move forward together, and that those who did not want to should not stand in the way of those that did. Coming just two days after the German election, Macron s speech is likely to be interpreted in Germany as an attempt to shape the debate before the coalition talks begin in earnest.  German coalition agreements are strict, with the contours set out in them limiting the government s room for maneuver. In that respect, Merkel s ability to work with Macron on EU reform will be pre-determined by whatever coalition deal is struck. FDP leader Christian Lindner said on Monday he would not agree to any coalition that did not promise a change in the German government s direction.  While that appeared to set the stage for tough talks, he also offered hope for Macron, saying when asked about the French president s eurozone budget ideas that the FDP had a  strong interest  in the strength of France.

"U.N. says 78,000 civilians could be trapped in Iraq's Hawija","BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Up to 78,000 people could be trapped in Islamic State-held Hawija in northern Iraq, the United Nations said on Tuesday, as security forces push to recapture the town. Iraq started an offensive on Sept. 21 to seize Hawija, which fell to the hands of militants after the Iraqi army collapsed in 2014 in the face of the Islamic State offensive and remains the last militant-held town in the country s north. U.N. humanitarian spokesman Jens Laerke said the number of people who have fled the fighting has increased from 7,000 people during the first week of the operation to some 12,500 people now. But up to 78,000 remain trapped, he said.  Iraqi security officials say the militants prevent some residents from leaving, while others are afraid of escaping toward government forces because of the explosives that might have been laid by Islamic State around the town.   We remain concerned for the lives and well-being of these vulnerable civilians and remind those doing the fighting that civilians must be protected at all times and allowed to safely leave Hawija,  Laerke said. Laerke said more people were expected to flee the fighting in areas around Hawija in the next 24 to 48 hours as security forces push into more densely populated areas. Hawija, north of Baghdad, and a stretch of land along the Syrian border, west of the Iraqi capital, are the last stretches of territory in Iraq still in the hands of Islamic State.

" Senate Has Had Enough Of Trump’s Obstruction, Handcuffs His Ability To Appoint An AG To Fire Mueller","Ever since the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions from the investigation into Russia s meddling in the 2016 presidential election and the subsequent appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Donald Trump has been attempting to find a way to get rid of Mueller and shut down the investigation. Since he doesn t have the power to fire Mueller directly, Trump has been gunning for a way to have an Attorney General installed who will do his bidding. It is the reason for his constant public humiliation of Sessions, and for his constantly calling the entire probe into his campaign s possible collusion with Russia a  witch hunt  and a  hoax.  Well, it seems that the United States Senate has had enough.Senators have been worried that Trump would fire Sessions and appoint a loyal toady in his place during the August recess without Senate confirmation. Therefore, they have decided to hold what are called pro-forma sessions during the recess to handcuff Trump s ability to appoint anyone to any positions without the approval of the majority of the United States Senate. These sessions are nothing more than having a member of the majority to preside briefly every three days during the recess, so that the Senate is technically in session. This keeps Trump from being able to do anything regarding whatever loyalists he may appoint to whatever position.This all comes on the heels of Special Counsel Mueller impaneling a grand jury with regards to the Russia investigation. Trump can t be happy, and will likely begin attacking Senators on Twitter once he learns what has just happened to his plans to fire Mueller before anyone around him can be indicted.This action on the part of the Senate should come as no surprise, though, as Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley has already warned Trump that he will absolutely not confirm a new Attorney General if Trump decides to fire Sessions.What s next, pre-emptive pardons? Something tells me that at this rate, the Senate will have an answer for that as well.Featured image via Thomas Lohnes/Getty Images",News,"August 4, 2017",1

Vietnamese court upholds jail term for prominent activist: lawyer,"HANOI (Reuters) - A court in Vietnam on Friday upheld a nine-year jail sentence for a prominent activist convicted of spreading propaganda against the state, her lawyer said. Blogger Tran Thi Nga, 40, was initially found guilty at a trial in July, six months after she was arrested in a widening crackdown on critics of the Communist government. Despite sweeping economic reform and increasing openness towards social change, the ruling party retains tight media censorship and does not tolerate criticism. Nga s sentence of nine years in prison and five years probation was upheld by a court in the central city of Nha Trang, one of her lawyers said.  Nga said she was innocent and was not guilty of propaganda against the state,  lawyer Ha Huy Son told Reuters by telephone. Court officials were not immediately available for comment. Nga s family did not have access to the hearing. The U.S. embassy said it was deeply troubled by the court s decision and that everyone in Vietnam should be able to express their political views without fear.  The United States calls on Vietnam to release Tran Thi Nga and all other prisoners of conscience immediately,  U.S. Embassy spokesman Pope Thrower said. In November, a Vietnamese court upheld a 10-year jail sentence for another prominent blogger, Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, known as  Me Nam , or Mother Mushroom, who was jailed for publishing propaganda against the state.

LONDON MOSQUE With Links to Terrorists Is Terrorized By Vengeful Londoner [Video],"The mosque in Finsbury Park, London where this morning s tragedy unfolded has been the centre of media attention before. It opened back in the late 80s, as the Muslim population in the area began to grow. Since then it s been one of the biggest prayer halls in Britain. However in the 90s the Mosque was accused of radicalism and its preachers linked to Al-Qaeda.Why was this Mosque allowed to go on with radical teachings after people like the shoe bomber were connected to it. It s time for the politically correct residents of towns like this to call out these Mosques. Notice that Muslims just moved to another Mosque instead of making an effort to oust the radicals within the Mosque.According to BBC,  Finsbury Park Mosque has long been synonymous with the worst fears about Islamist extremism in Britain. The mosque s new leadership have been struggling to reclaim it for the local community   but that struggle raises questions about who runs mosques in Britain. The Finsbury Park Mosque opened in 1988. And with one of the then biggest prayer halls in Britain, many Muslims regarded it as a major milestone,  BBC wrote.  But by the late 1990s, amid the growth of radical Islamism, it had become a meeting place for extreme voices, including that of Abu Hamza. The mosque was visited by  Kamel Bourgass, an Algerian man jailed for the murder of a policeman and an alleged ricin poison plot,  BBC reported.According to the Telegraph,  The Finsbury Park mosque was long known to have served as a clearing house for radical Muslims after Hamza arrived as imam in 1997. His hate-filled rants inspired attendees such as Richard Reid (SEE BELOW), the failed  shoe bomber , Zacarias Moussaoui, one of the 9/11 terror plotters, and Mohammed Sidique Khan, one of the four suicide bombers who blew themselves up on public transport in London on July 7, 2005.

North Korea defiant over U.N. sanctions as Trump says tougher steps needed,"SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea displayed trademark defiance on Wednesday over new United Nations sanctions imposed after its sixth and largest-ever nuclear test, vowing to redouble efforts to fight off what it said was the threat of a U.S. invasion. U.S. President Donald Trump said the sanctions, unanimously agreed on Monday by the 15-member U.N. Security Council, were just a small step toward what is ultimately needed to rein in Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs. North Korea s Foreign Ministry said the resolutions were an infringement on its legitimate right to self-defense and aimed at  completely suffocating its state and people through full-scale economic blockade .  The DPRK will redouble the efforts to increase its strength to safeguard the country s sovereignty and right to existence and to preserve peace and security of the region by establishing the practical equilibrium with the U.S.,  it said in a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency. The Democratic People s Republic of Korea (DPRK) is North Korea s official name. The statement echoed comments on Tuesday by DPRK s Ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Han Tae Song, who said Pyongyang was  ready to use a form of ultimate means .  The forthcoming measures ... will make the U.S. suffer the greatest pain it ever experienced in its history,  Han said. The North s Rodong Sinmun newspaper also accused South Korea of being Washington s  puppet , criticizing Seoul s agreement with the United States to amend an existing bilateral guideline that will now allow the South to use unlimited warhead payloads on its missiles. The U.N. Security Council agreed to tighten sanctions on North Korea, banning its textile exports and capping fuel supplies, and making it illegal for foreign firms to form commercial joint ventures with North Korean entities. The U.N. resolution was triggered by North Korea s test of what it said was a hydrogen bomb. Damage to mountainous terrain at the North s nuclear test site in Punggye-ri seen in satellite imagery taken after the latest test was more extensive than anything seen after the five previous tests, said 38 North, a Washington-based project which monitors North Korea. There was also activity at another location in the Mount Mantap site involving large vehicles and mining equipment that suggests  onsite work could now be changing focus to further prepare those other portals for future underground nuclear testing , 38 North said. The North accuses the United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, of continual plans for invasion. North Korea has also tested a missile capable of reaching the United States, but experts say it is likely to be at least a year before it can field an operational nuclear missile that could threaten the U.S. mainland. A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said intelligence agencies had observed North Korea moving a mobile missile launcher in the past 48 hours which could potentially indicate a possible missile launch by the North in the coming days. The official did not comment on the location or the type of missile, but emphasized that while a launch was possible, North Korea could simply be moving the launcher. Trump has vowed not to allow that to happen. A tougher initial U.S. draft resolution was weakened to win the support of China and Russia, both of which hold veto power on the U.N. Security Council. Significantly, it stopped short of imposing a full embargo on oil exports to North Korea, most of which come from China.  We think it s just another very small step, not a big deal,  Trump told reporters at the start of a Tuesday meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.  I don t know if it has any impact, but certainly it was nice to get a 15-to-nothing vote, but those sanctions are nothing compared to what ultimately will have to happen.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also warned China, North Korea s main ally and trading partner, that Washington would  put additional sanctions on them and prevent them from accessing the U.S. and international dollar system  if it did not follow through on the new measures. Another senior administration official told Reuters that any such  secondary sanctions  on Chinese banks and other companies were on hold for now to give Beijing time to show it was prepared to fully enforce the latest and previous rounds of sanctions. Washington has so far mostly held off on new sanctions against Chinese banks and other companies doing business with North Korea, given fears of retaliation by Beijing and possibly far-reaching effects on the world economy. Russia and China both say they respect U.N. sanctions and have called on the United States to return to negotiations with North Korea. They have also said they could kick-start talks with North Korea if the United States halts joint military drills with South Korea, which Washington has rejected. An article carried on the front page of the People s Daily, the official paper of China s ruling Communist Party, said the Korean Peninsula had reached the  moment of choice  where the United States and North Korea must break from the cycle of nuclear tests and sanctions.   All parties involved in the peninsula have their own strategic considerations, but not being able to see beyond this vicious cycle is not in anyone s interest,  the article said. Asked about the North Korean and U.S. rhetoric, China s Foreign Ministry reiterated a call for restraint and a return to dialogue.   We hope all relevant parties can be rational and maintain restraint and not take actions that could further increase tensions on the peninsula , ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular briefing.  In another show of force, South Korea s Air Force conducted its first live-fire exercise of Taurus long-range, air-to-surface missiles on Tuesday, the Defence Ministry said, as practice for precision bombing North Korean facilities. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said the new sanctions could eventually starve North Korea of an additional $500 million or more in annual revenue. The United States has said that a previous round of sanctions agreed in August was aimed at cutting North Korea s $3 billion in exports by a third. ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",0
Republicans hammer on at Iran deal on presidential campaign,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidates took swipes on Tuesday at the lifting of sanctions against Iran, but they disagree on how they would to handle Tehran if they win the White House at the Nov. 8 election. Iran can expect an abrupt shift in relations with the United States to a more aggressive posture under a Republican president, a reversal of the warming trend nurtured by Democratic President Barack Obama.                 With only two weeks to go before the first nominating contest in the presidential race, Republican candidates have devoted large sections of their stump speeches to Iran, giving Tehran as much time as they devote to their condemnations of Islamic State militants, also known as ISIS. “I would say this,” Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush told the Council on Foreign Relations in New York on Tuesday. “The convergence of an aggressive Iran in the region and ISIS are the two threats that we have to deal with and from day one we have to confront those ambitions.” Obama has carried out a 2008 campaign pledge to negotiate with Iran by striking an agreement last year to curb Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. That deal was capped over the weekend when the United States along with other countries lifted sanctions against Iran, and Washington swapped prisoners with the Islamic Republic.  While Republican condemnations of Obama’s Iran policy abound, there is a split among the candidates as to how far to go with Tehran. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz from Texas and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio say they would rip up the nuclear deal and start over, on the thinking that the United States would be able to persuade European allies to reimpose economic sanctions. “The Europeans are going to have to decide do they want to deal with the Iranian economy or the American economy,” said Cruz foreign policy adviser Victoria Coates. “That’s the choice we have to put to them.” A Rubio adviser said the Senator from Florida feels strongly that Iran had gotten the better of the Obama administration and that Rubio would only begin to discuss better relations with Tehran if it were willing to respect human rights and change its stance on Israel. “I am going to cancel that ridiculous deal,” Rubio said last week in Mount Pleasant, S.C. Other candidates like Ohio Governor John Kasich and front-runner Donald Trump are more cautious, preferring to wait and see what the situation is with Iran once the next president is sworn in on Jan. 20, 2017. Kasich told Reuters that the United States should be working with U.S. allies now to ensure Iran sticks to the deal reining in its nuclear program and only if there are any violations the sanctions should be quickly reimposed. “I think as time goes on it’s going to be harder because people are addicted to money,” he said. “I don’t know where we’re going to be in 10 months. No one knows where we’re going to be.” Trump has said it would be tough to rip up the agreement with Iran on its nuclear program but has vowed that if he were elected president he would “police that contract so tough they don’t have a chance.” Republican Senator John McCain, the party’s 2008 presidential nominee, told Reuters the argument over whether to stick to the Iran agreement is academic because he believes Iran will violate the nuclear deal. “I think the best thing to do is evaluate it on Inauguration Day,” he said. “You’re going to have between the election and the Jan. 20 swearing-in to evaluate whether they have adhered to it and make a judgment then. But I think it’s a very bad agreement.”      (Reporting By Steve Holland; Editing by Alistair Bell) SAP is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of Reuters News Agency.",politicsNews,"January 19, 2016 ",0

In a statement, Flake did not say how he might vote on the proposal unveiled earlier Thursday. “I remain concerned over how the current tax reform proposals will grow the already staggering national debt by opting for short-term fixes while ignoring long-term problems for taxpayers and the economy,” he said. Both the Senate and House tax cut plans would add about $1.5 trillion to the U.S. national debt over 10 years. Lawmakers should achieve tax reform in a fiscally responsible manner, Flake said, adding that he looked forward to working with his colleagues “to deliver on that goal.”    ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2017 ",0
Mexico will 'immediately' respond to any U.S. border tax: minister,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico must be ready to respond immediately with its own tax measures if the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump imposes a border tax, the economy minister said on Friday, warning such protectionism may trigger a global recession.  Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has promised a “major border tax” on companies that shift jobs outside the United States, and such a measure could hobble Mexico’s exports to its top trading partner. “It is clear we need to be prepared to immediately neutralize the impact of such a measure,” Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said in an interview on Mexican television.  “And it is very clear how - take a fiscal action that clearly neutralizes it,” he said.  Trump has repeatedly attacked Mexico over trade, jobs and immigration since he first launched his run for the White House in 2015, driving the peso currency to historic lows and unnerving investors, especially in the auto sector.  Guajardo said Trump’s proposed tax “was a problem for the entire world” and that it “would have a wave of impacts that could take us into a global recession.”  Nonetheless, the minister said he expected foreign direct investment in Mexico this year to total around $25 billion, with investment in the energy and telecommunications sectors expected to more than make up for the loss of a planned $1.6 billion Ford Motor Co. (F.N) factory that the company said this month it is cancelling. Trump had strongly criticized the plan, but Ford said its decision was not the result of pressure from Trump. Guajardo also praised the government of Japan and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) for their “reasonable” response to Trump’s threat to impose a significant border tax if the company does not stop making its Corolla model in Mexico for the U.S. market. Toyota said last week the automaker has no immediate plans to curb production in Mexico.  “Toyota has 10 plants in the United States... and employs more than 130,000 Americans. If I were Mr. Trump, I’d treat them with more respect,” Guajardo said. He added that he expects total foreign direct investment during the six-year term of President Enrique Pena Nieto, which ends in late 2018, to average $30 billion annually. Guajardo has previously warned that U.S. corporate tax cuts proposed by Trump, as well as the border tax, could undermine foreign investment in Latin America’s No. 2 economy.

"Thailand says closely watching Myanmar crisis, ready to provide aid","BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand s foreign ministry, in a rare statement on an ongoing crisis in neighboring Myanmar s Rakhine state, said late on Saturday that it was  closely following the situation  and would provide aid to the governments of Myanmar and Bangladesh. Violence erupted in Rakhine last month when Rohingya militants attacked security posts, triggering a crackdown by the Myanmar army. More than half a million ethnic Rohingya - a mostly Muslim minority who are denied citizenship by Myanmar - have fled to Bangladesh since then. Those who fled accuse Myanmar s army, backed by Buddhist mobs, of a brutal killing campaign. The United Nations has described as ethnic cleansing a sweeping government offensive in the north of Rakhine State in response to those attacks.  Thailand is closely following the situation in the Rakhine State with concern,  the ministry said.  The Royal Thai Government has always placed great importance to providing care and protection to Myanmar displaced persons,  it added, pointing to some 100,000 refugees from Myanmar who live in nine camps along the Thai-Myanmar border. But many of those living in the camps are long-term residents who fled conflict decades ago. None are Rohingya, according to non-governmental organizations who work there. The Thai foreign ministry said its statement was in response to views raised by some human rights groups regarding Thailand s position on the unrest in Rakhine. Amnesty International last week said Thailand must not  push back  Rohingya fleeing violence and that it should provide refugees formal legal status and protection. Thailand does not recognize the status of any refugees or recognize the Rohingya as legitimate migrant workers. Thailand said it supported a statement on the issue by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a grouping of 10 nations. In the statement, ASEAN foreign ministers condemned the attacks on Myanmar s security forces and  all acts of violence which resulted in loss of civilian lives . Malaysia, an ASEAN member, disassociated itself from the statement, saying it misrepresented issues relating to the exodus of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya. So far,  none of the affected victims from the August unrest in Rakhine State have been found in Thailand,  the Thai foreign ministry said. ",worldnews,"October 1, 2017 ",0
"France's Macron, unions seek upper hand in struggle over reforms","PARIS (Reuters) - Emmanuel Macron may have won the opening salvo in his battle to reform France s economy, but a nationwide strike by public workers this week will put more pressure on a leader struggling to shake off criticism that he is  president of the rich . Strike notices have been lodged in schools, hospitals, airports and government ministries. Tuesday s protest over plans to axe 120,000 jobs and reduce sick leave compensation will be the first time in a decade that all nine unions representing 5.4 million public workers have united behind a protest call. The walkout comes as Macron, 39, looks to reverse damaging headlines after a week in which he scrapped a wealth tax and was recorded making unsympathetic remarks about workers at a struggling factory. Opponents reacted by branding him out of touch with ordinary voters.  It should be a massive mobilization of workers,  Mylene Jacquot, a senior official from France s largest trade union, the moderate CFDT, told reporters. Macron says France s economy needs re-shaping to lure investment and rein in spending, as he strives to persuade Berlin that Paris can be a credible partner with whom to drive European reform. Public sector workers say they are bearing the brunt of the government s effort to tame its fiscal deficit. Macron defied tens of thousands of protesters   far fewer compared with demonstrations of the past    last month to drive through labor reforms that simplify employment rules and give companies more power to set working conditions.  Civil servants, retired people and students are not giving up as they look anxiously towards a proposed overhaul of the employment insurance and pension systems.  So far, Unions have been unable to speak with a single voice. Among workers there are signs of mounting agitation for a tougher stance, notably from the CFDT and Force Ouvriere union which both shunned the labor reform strikes.  You can hear it in the room. The rank and file is saying  we ve got to act, we ve got to give a different answer ,  Norbert Raffolt told union bosses at a CFDT convention. Government measures to cut housing aid and increase certain social security contributions while reducing corporate tax and scrapping a levy on wealth have infuriated socialist opponents and drawn attacks from left-leaning media       Robin Hood robbed from the rich to give to the poor. Macron is more cold-hearted, more ruthless: he takes from the poorest to give to the wealthiest,  wrote one commentator in Liberation newspaper. The centrist government says its policies are balanced and will increase the spending power of households.  We want to create wealth in France ... and at the same time take steps to bolster the purchasing power of workers, of pensioners,  Francois de Rugy, a close Macron ally and president of the National Assembly, told Europe 1 radio on Sunday.      Until now, Macron, whose popularity has slumped since he came to power in May, has been able to take comfort from the divided response of unions to his sweeping reform agenda. France was once a champion of social protest, with unions able to shut down swathes of the economy and force ministers to respond. But strikes have become less frequent and less successful as the number heeding calls for industrial action falls. Companies in France lost 81 days to strikes per 1,000 workers in 2014, compared with more than 300 days in the late 1990s and over a thousand days in the late 1980s, according to government data. It is not clear how much disruption Tuesday s public workers  strike will cause to schools, transport networks, hospitals and libraries.  One teachers  union said nearly half of all primary school teachers in Paris would strike on Tuesday, forcing dozens of schools to close. The aviation authority has asked airlines to cancel a third of flights at airports across the country because of anticipated staff shortages.       ",worldnews,"October 8, 2017 ",0

So is McCain   who s a member of the press   insinuating that that the tenets that Streep is fighting for is what got Trump elected? Because if that s so (which it isn t), McCain missed the entire point of the speech (hint: she did).Perhaps Meghan would have felt differently if Streep brought up how Trump mocked her dad for being a POW.And, in all honesty, if Streep s speech was that traumatic that it drives right-wingers to the polls, they are way more fragile than the  snowflakes  Tomi Lahren decries.Democrats get called  baby killers  all the time by the right yet we move on and actually get stuff done, not complain on Twitter.Radio host Tim Young had this to say:Sorry Meryl Streep fans, there s nothing brave about a privileged millionaire white woman pandering to you and a room of her liberal friends  Tim Young (@TimRunsHisMouth) January 9, 2017Sorry, Tim, there s nothing admirable or acceptable about a billionaire orange man mocking  disabled person to pander to poorly-educated voters.Conservatives are mad that a Hollywood entertainer called a fellow Hollywood entertainer.

Native Americans move to frontlines in battle over voting rights,"BELCOURT, North Dakota (Reuters) - Elvis Norquay, a member of the Chippewa Indian tribe, has lived most of his 58 years on North Dakota’s remote Turtle Mountain reservation and says he’s never had a problem voting. That was before 2014, when he hitched a ride with a friend to cast a ballot in local and congressional elections and was turned away. Embarrassed, he asked why he couldn’t vote. He was told he lacked proper ID under new state requirements. He has no phone, no current driver’s license and his tribal ID lacks a street address. “When we left, my friend said, ‘that’s not right’,” said Norquay, who has lived on disability since 2002 in a rural county near the Canadian border. Norquay is among a growing number of Native Americans embroiled in court battles over changes to voting laws that could influence the outcome of some tight races in the November 2016 presidential and congressional elections. While the Native American population is small nationally, lawsuits involving tribes over voting problems have proliferated since the Supreme Court struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, a signature legislative achievement of the 1960s civil rights movement. North Dakota is one of 17 states that have new voting restrictions in place since the last presidential contest, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. Many of these changes have sparked lawsuits and accusations that black, Hispanic and other minority voters could be disenfranchised. Five federal lawsuits involving Native Americans have been filed since the Supreme Court decision, including three this year alone. Suits in North Dakota, Utah, South Dakota and Arizona claim new voting rules passed in majority Republican states are discriminatory and could reduce voting by tribal members, who tend to back Democrats. A suit in Alaska, for example, claimed the state violated federal rules by failing to translate voting materials for tribal voters. The tribes say changes to voting rules in those states disproportionately affect Native Americans, an allegation the states and counties deny. The Native American vote is not big enough to flip a safe Republican state such as North Dakota into the Democrat column in this year’s presidential election, but Native Americans are a growing proportion of the population and a majority in some counties where increased voter turnout in recent years has tipped the balance in some congressional races. In many states, the number of Native Americans is growing faster than the population as a whole. Between 2000 and 2010, the Native American population rose by 26.7 percent to 1.1 million, compared to 9.7 percent growth in America’s overall population, census data showed. Recent changes to voting laws, such as North Dakota’s new voter ID law, are part of “a much broader, deliberate, and concerted effort by Republicans to reduce turnout among particular groups of voters on election day,” said Pratt Wiley, head of voter protection issues at the Democratic Party in Washington. “Those voters are more vulnerable today than they were before the Supreme Court invalidated a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in 2013,” he said of Native Americans. Republicans deny that voting law changes passed by Republican-dominated legislatures are discriminatory and say they are intended to reduce fraudulent votes. “These are popular common sense laws to protect elections from fraud,” said Lindsay Walters, national spokeswoman at the Republican National Committee. At issue in North Dakota are revisions pushed largely by Republican state legislators in 2013 and 2015 to a 2003 state elections law that eliminated a provision that had allowed people without proper identification such as Norquay to vote if they were recognized by a poll worker or if they signed an affidavit swearing to their identity. Norquay and six other members of his tribe sued the secretary of state in January in U.S. District Court in North Dakota. They said they were refused the right to vote in November 2014 because many old tribal IDs such as Norquay’s don’t list a current residential address.  It says some tribal members can’t afford a new tribal ID or struggle to obtain proper identification because there are no state offices that provide driver’s licenses on the reservations.  Richard McCloud, chairman of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, said widespread unemployment and poverty among tribal members meant that some struggle to afford the $10 needed to obtain a new tribal card.  “Ten dollars is three pounds of hamburger and some macaroni for a family,” said McCloud at the tribe’s headquarters on the reservation of about 4,274 people a few miles (km) south of the Canadian border. “Maybe it’s no big deal if you work, but it’s a big deal to people that don’t have access to $10,” he said. North Dakota’s secretary of state, Al Jaeger, the only defendant in the suit, said in an interview that the law is not discriminatory and simplifies the voting process in the only state in the country that does not require voters to register ahead of an election. He said his office has spent heavily on ad campaigns to educate voters about what IDs are accepted. Jaeger’s deputy, Jim Silrum, said the ID requirements are not a barrier for the 97 percent of state residents with driver’s licenses, an accepted form of ID, so the number of people affected by the changes is miniscule. Those with no driver’s license, can get a non-driver state ID allowed at the polls from the motor vehicle department for free. Jaeger and Silrum said they could not respond directly to an assertion in the lawsuit that residents on reservations have to travel long distances to obtain a state ID. Republican state Representative Jim Kasper from Fargo repeated his party’s argument that the changes were aimed at reducing the risk of voter fraud, but Silrum said there was little evidence of such irregularities. In the 2012 presidential election, there were only nine cases of people voting twice, but that was because they used the same ID rather than a lack of proper identification, he said. State Representative Kylie Oversen, a Democrat from Grand Forks, said the changes could alter tight elections in favor of Republicans. She said Republicans pushed for the bill after Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2012 by less than 3,000 votes. In sparsely populated states such as North Dakota, with just 739,000 people, congressional elections have been decided by just a few thousand votes. Rolette County, surrounding Norquay’s reservation, is one of two counties in the state where about 75 percent of the population is Native American. Those two counties were the only places in North Dakota that gave President Barack Obama more than 70 percent of the vote in 2012. After the changes in the ID law were implemented in North Dakota, voter turnout in Rolette County dropped by more than 12 percentage points between the 2010 and 2014 mid-term elections, more than any other county in the state, election data from the secretary of state’s office shows. “What has happened is the Native American vote has become something that can tip elections,” said Jean Schroedel, a professor at Claremont Graduate University in California who studies Native American voting. The Native American Rights Fund, a non-profit law firm representing Norquay and other members of his tribe in the lawsuit against the state, plans to file a motion by June 30 requesting that the court invalidate the changes to the ID law ahead of November’s election, according to court documents.

Ryan urges Obama to rule out sanctions 'workarounds' for Iran,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, called on President Barack Obama on Monday to “definitively” rule out any possible sanctions “workaround” that might provide Iran, directly or indirectly, with access to the U.S. financial system or dollar. “Instead of helping the regime get richer, the administration should hold it accountable for its continued ballistic missile tests, egregious human rights violations and support for terrorism,” the Republican congressional leader said in his strongest statement yet on the issue.

" Good News Folks, God Is Now Protecting Donald Trump From A ‘Concentrated Satanic Attack’ (VIDEO)","Were you worried that Donald Trump might fall victim to a  concentrated Satanic attack?  Yeah? Well, you aren t alone. But good news folks, you don t have to worry about that anymore! God himself is now protecting the GOP nominee from the Dark Lord.On Wednesday, Trump attended the Midwest Vision and Values Pastors Leadership conference in Cleveland. Trump-loving black man who lost his damn mind pastor Darrell Scott was worried that Satan might be after Trump too, which is ironic since most of us assumed the Republican nominee was working for the Prince of Darkness already.Scott claims that before Trump began is bid for the presidency, a nationally known  preacher warned him  that if you choose to run for president, there s going to be a concentrated Satanic attack against you. He said there s going to be a demon, principalities and powers, that are going to war against you on a level that you ve never seen before and I m watching it every day,  Scott said.Scott s wife, Belinda Scott, prayed over Trump as those around him laid hands on the bigoted billionaire, making sure Satan knew they were serious, dammit: God we ask you right now that Your choice is this choice. God, I ask that you would touch this man, Donald J. Trump,  she continued,  give him the anointing to lead this nation. Because what would Jesus do? Well, duh! He d make America great again.

"Sanders blocks Obama nominee to lead FDA, citing industry ties","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said on Tuesday he has placed a hold on President Barack Obama’s nominee to head the Food and Drug Administration, claiming he is too close to the pharmaceutical industry to be an impartial regulator. The move by the U.S. senator from Vermont comes one day after Democratic Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts also placed a hold on the nomination until the agency agrees to reform its process for approving opioid painkillers. The nominee, Dr. Robert Califf, is a cardiologist and researcher who joined the FDA a year ago as a deputy commissioner. He previously held senior positions at Duke University, where he founded a large academic research center that received more than half of its funding from the drug industry. “Dr. Califf’s extensive ties to the pharmaceutical industry give me no reason to believe that he would make the FDA work for ordinary Americans, rather than just the CEOs of pharmaceutical companies,” Sanders said in a statement. A “hold” is a procedure by which a senator can prevent a measure from being voted on by the full Senate. Peter Pitts, a former associate commissioner for external affairs at the FDA who is now president of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, said no hold has ever killed a vote on an FDA commissioner and he does not expect it to now. “It would be very undemocratic not to let the other senators have their say,” he said. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions voted earlier this month to confirm Califf as FDA commissioner, a position open since Dr. Margaret Hamburg stepped down last February. Kevin Griffis, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, said Califf “is the right person with the right experience to build on the FDA’s unsurpassed record of protecting public health while encouraging innovation and the introduction of new life-saving therapies to the market.” He added: “We would like to see him confirmed as quickly as possible.” On Monday, HHS said that addressing the opioid crisis was “a top priority.” Markey wants opioid approval matters to be reviewed by an FDA advisory committee and believes the committee should consider the risk of addiction and abuse during the approval process. He also wants the agency to rescind approval of OxyContin for children and convene an advisory panel to guide that process. Sanders said he shared Markey’s concerns about the FDA’s approach to opioid painkillers. Too many Americans are dying from what has become an “opioid epidemic,” he said in a statement. U.S. deaths from drug overdoses hit a record in 2014, increasing 6.5 percent to 47,055, propelled by prescription painkiller and heroin abuse, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The FDA does not control drug prices, but Sanders said that “at a time when millions of Americans cannot afford to purchase the prescription drugs they require, we need a leader at the FDA who is prepared to stand up to the drug companies.” Last year, he said, one in five Americans, or 35 million people, could not afford to fill their prescriptions. Sanders has made healthcare a key theme of his campaign to be the Democratic Party’s candidate in the November election. He is competing with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley. Califf is widely expected to ultimately be confirmed as FDA commissioner. “I don’t think Senator Sanders’ hold will slow the process down,” Pitts said. Califf will need to meet with Sanders and reassure him of the FDA’s independence, Pitts said. “In the meantime,” he added, “He’s made his point.”  (Reporting by Susan Heavey; Editing by David Alexander, Jeffrey Benkoe, Jonathan Oatis and David Gregorio) SAP is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of Reuters News Agency.",politicsNews,"January 26, 2016 ",0
U.S. attorney general says tech companies should help access encrypted evidence,"(Reuters) - Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday accused technology companies of failing to adequately help federal investigators access encrypted communications, saying over the past year that the FBI was blocked from accessing nearly 7,500 mobile devices. Sessions criticized the technology sector in a speech in New York City, just two days after Sayfullo Saipov, an Uzbek immigrant, allegedly drove a truck down a lower Manhattan bike path, killing eight people and injuring 11. Saipov said he was inspired by Islamic State videos, according to investigators. Sessions, speaking at the U.S. attorney’s office not far from the site of the attack, addressed the tragedy by offering his condolences. He then laid out a three-point plan to combat terrorism more generally, which he said should include new immigration restrictions, improved access to electronic communications and continued efforts to “aggressively surveill non-citizen terrorists overseas.” “Terrorists should know: This administration will use all lawful tools at our disposal,” Sessions said, saying such tools will include using both federal courts and military proceedings at Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba to prosecute terrorism suspects.   “If anyone has any doubt about that, they can ask the more than 500 criminals whom the Department of Justice has convicted of terrorism-related offenses since 9/11, he said, referring to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. “And they can ask the dozens of enemy combatants in Guantanamo Bay.”  Sessions did not say whether he thought that Saipov should be sent to Guantanamo, though he did voice support for a proposal by President Donald Trump to scrap a diversity visa program and replace it with a merit-based system. On Wednesday, Trump said he would consider sending Saipov to a military prison at Guantanamo. No detainee has been sent to there since 2008. Sessions on Thursday also harshly criticized Silicon Valley, saying technology companies too often “refuse to cooperate with law enforcement or even to comply with court orders.”   As an example, he cited a 2015 terrorist incident in Garland, Texas, after two gunmen opened fired with assault rifles at an exhibit featuring caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed. Sessions said one of the terrorists had sent more than 100 instant messages to another terrorist overseas.  “What we don’t know, however, is what he said - because those messages are encrypted,” he said. The Justice Department in recent weeks has been signaling it plans to take a tougher stance with technology companies over accessing encrypted data. Last month, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein also discussed the topic, and suggested attempts to negotiate with the tech sector were a waste of time because they valued profit over stopping crime.

" EVERY State In America Just Turned On Trump, This Is A Major ‘F*ck You’ To POTUS (DETAILS)","From day one of Donald Trump s failure of a presidency, it was perfectly clear that the former reality television star thought he was a king and expected America to roll over and do whatever the hell he wanted. Unfortunately for the unworthy POTUS, his presidency is panning out a lot differently than he imagined, and he s just been sent another great big  f*ck you  by the United States.Trump s voter fraud conspiracy has just been dealt a major blow and suffered a humiliating defeat, as every single state in America is refusing to give up the voter data that Trump is demanding. According to The Washington Post: In a rare display of bipartisanship, officials in nearly every state have said they will partially or fully refuse to comply with President Trump s voting commission, which has encountered criticism and opposition after issuing a sweeping request for voter data nationwide. Even as some of the resistance centers on Trump and members of his commission, the broader responses from the states indicate a strong and widespread belief that local officials should be managing elections and that the White House s request for volumes of information went too far. That s right   America as a whole united and agreed that what Trump wanted was unconstitutional or illegal, and made moves to protect Americans  private data. This is not only extremely embarrassing for Trump, but it also reveals that his administration is increasingly lazy and sloppy, having not even bothered to look and see if their request for the voter data was legal by state law!Unlike Trump and his incompetent team, the majority of America is not so reckless and willing to bow down to a complete idiot. This will go down in the books as yet another one of Trump s failures, as he is once again defeated by the checks and balances he thought he could overrun with his dictator-style  leadership.

 Louisiana Governor Blasts Trump Over His Photo-Op Exploitation,"While Republicans try to make Louisiana s deadly floods  Obama s Katrina,  there is only one person getting flack for being a raging opportunist   you guessed it   Donald Trump.Louisiana s Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards, blasted the Republican nominee for president after he showed up to Louisiana for a photo opportunity. While citizens are dying and being displaced by the thousands, Trump has decided he would exploit the carnage in an attempt to undermine President Obama.Remember when President Obama was chided by the GOP for not calling Gov. Rick Scott for two days after the Orlando massacre? Well, flooding has been going on in Louisiana for a week and still, Donald Trump has not reached out to the governor or any state leader tasked with handling the crisis. A spokesman for the governor pointed out:Donald Trump hasn t called the governor to inform him of his visit. We welcome him to LA but not for a photo-op. Instead we hope he ll consider volunteering or making a sizable donation to the LA Flood Relief Fund to help the victims of the storm.Trump, the self described billionaire and charitable man, should donate.While Republicans continue to bash President Obama, Edwards has gone on the record asking that President Obama not travel to Louisiana for at least a week until the state is more secure   out of respect and timeliness of those working to aid the state.Trump s newest campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said the trip is  a decidedly nonpolitical event, no press allowed, going to help people on the ground who are in need. And what did Trump do as soon as she said that? He took questions from the press and said President Obama would rather play golf than help those affected in Louisiana. Even though President Obama has secured the relief funds for the state and has expressed his support and thoughts for those affected, the Trump train has decided to use the opportunity to smear him and once again make Trump look like the unsung hero of the day.So much for no media and not being political.Once again, Trump is exploiting and using people s pain for personal gain. He s done that his entire life, so why stop now.Featured image via Joshua Lott/Getty Images",News,"August 19, 2016",1
" John McCain Makes MASSIVE Error In Rush To Bash Obama, And It May Have Cost Him His Re-election","John McCain was already walloped by Barack Obama in a presidential election, so it s only natural that the president would be at the center of what very well end McCain s political career entirely.The man responsible for bringing Sarah Palin into our lives isn t exactly known for his impulse-control, but it appears he massively overplayed his hand in his latest rush to bash President Obama. In the days after long-time Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia passed away, McCain became one of the de facto cheerleaders for the Senate Republican plan to spend the next year preventing Obama from fulfilling his constitutional obligation to nominate a replacement.He announced that he would be standing with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in opposing any nomination until after the election   which means the seat would remain unfilled for nearly a year, and perhaps a great deal longer. For Republicans, this knee-jerk obstruction was so automatic that it seems almost nobody thought it through beforehand. So quick were they to oppose Obama, that they didn t stop to think about how it would look for the party already known for saying  no  to issue blanket opposition to a constitutional mandate.McCain, like many of his colleagues, is now discovering that his headlong rush into obstruction may be a career-ending blunder. A new poll conducted by Public Policy Polling found that his constituents in Arizona are fed up with his antics, and his already-low favorability numbers are tanking hard.As to McCain s position, 55 percent said it made them less likely to vote for his re-election this year; 21 percent said it made them more likely to vote for him; and 24 percent said it wouldn t make any difference.The poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.2 percentage points, also indicated that just 26 percent approve of McCain s job performance while 63 percent disapprove and 12 percent were unsure.In short: Nobody in Arizona seems to have any respect for John McCain. That s not a good position to be in, because McCain is facing a tough primary and an even tougher Democratic challenger in November. Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick is running for McCain s seat, and wasted no time calling out the senator: Members of the U.S. Senate have an obligation to uphold the Constitution and fulfill their duties, including voting on Supreme Court nominees regardless of party affiliation,  Kirkpatrick told the press via a prepared statement.  John McCain used to take that responsibility seriously. Care to hazard a guess what McCain s reaction to the poll was? Here s his campaign spokeswoman: This fake  poll from liberal activists is the creation of partisan Democrat hacks who have tried and failed for years to defeat John McCain. Liberal bias, right on cue.At this point in his life, McCain isn t just fighting for his continued career in politics, he s fighting for his legacy. Rather than go out with a modicum of integrity, he decided to listen to the lemmings in his party that promised him that salvation was just beyond that edge of that cliff they were headed towards. It s painful to watch. Sadly, for politicians, you are only as good as the last thing you did. McCain will go out being remembered as a deeply unpopular senator who was so blinded by his hatred of Obama that it prevented him from accomplishing anything.Featured image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",News,"March 5, 2016",1
German railway under fire for proposal to name train 'Anne Frank',"BERLIN (Reuters) - German rail operator Deutsche Bahn is facing a siege of online criticism over a proposal to name a high-speed train after Holocaust victim Anne Frank, who was deported by train to the Auschwitz concentration camp. The idea to name the high-speed ICE 4 train after Frank came from proposals made by Deutsche Bahn customers and the German public, which a panel reviewed. Of 19,400 submissions, Anne Frank was one of the most popular names, it said.  Aware of the historical responsibility we bear, we made a deliberate decision to help keep Anne Frank s memory alive,  Bahn said in a statement.  It was not our intention to disrespect the memory of Anne Frank in any way whatsoever.  Critics say the plan was insensitive. Frank was deported from her home in Amsterdam and taken to Auschwitz by train in September 1944. She was later moved the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where she died in early 1945. Iris Eberl, a conservative Bavarian lawmaker, said on twitter the plan was  disrespectful. Mirjam Wenzel, director of the Jewish Museum in Frankfurt, where Frank was born, tweeted that the idea was  based on historical amnesia . The Anne Frank House, the museum that preserves the family s hiding place in Amsterdam, said in a statement that the idea of naming the train after her  is painful for the people who experienced these deportations, and causes fresh pain to those who still bear the consequences of those times within them.

Clinton voices concern about Russian interference in election,"HAMPTON, Ill. (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Monday expressed concern about “credible reports” of Russian interference in the U.S. election and accused Donald Trump of being fixated on dictators including Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Taking questions from reporters for more than 20 minutes on her campaign plane, Clinton said both Democrats and Republicans should be concerned about Russia’s behavior. “The fact that our intelligence professionals are now studying this and taking it seriously raises some grave questions about potential Russian interference with our electoral process,” Clinton said. “We are facing a very serious concern. We’ve never had a foreign adversarial power be already involved in our electoral process. ... We’ve never had the nominee of one of our major parties urging the Russians to hack more,” she said. Trump, the Republican nominee, has praised Putin, the president of Russia, and has called on Moscow to dig up tens of thousands of “missing” emails from Clinton’s time as head of the U.S. State Department. He later said his comments were meant to be sarcastic. Clinton has previously tied Russian intelligence services to the cyber hack on the Democratic National Committee.  Asked on Monday if she believed the Russian government was trying to help elect her opponent, Clinton paused. “I often quote a great saying that I learned from living in Arkansas for many years: If you find a turtle on a fencepost it didn’t get there by itself,” she said. “I think it’s quite intriguing that this activity has happened around the time Trump became the nominee.” Clinton, a former secretary of state and a former first lady, has drawn criticism for not holding regular press conferences. On Monday she took questions on an array of topics for more than 20 minutes. Clinton dismissed concerns about her health as one of many conspiracy theories that were lobbed against her. She blamed seasonal allergies for a sustained coughing fit at an earlier event in Ohio. During the question and answer session on her plane, she also had to step away because of persistent coughing. Clinton, whose use of a private email account during her time as secretary of state has dogged her 2016  presidential campaign, said she understood and took classification seriously when she was President Barack Obama’s top diplomat. Clinton said that the attacks on her family’s foundation were not rooted in fact and sidestepped a question on whether her daughter, Chelsea, should step down from the foundation’s leadership if she is elected in November.

REVEALED: HOW BARACK OBAMA IS FUNDING The “Resistance” Movement Against President Trump,"Wall Street might be shocked to learn it is helping bankroll the anti-Trump  resistance  movement that s aggressively fighting policies it favors   including corporate tax cuts and the repeal of Obama-era banking and health-care regulations.The payola is potentially earmarked for third-party interest groups approved by the Justice Department and HUD without requiring any proof of how the funds will be spent. Many of the recipients so far are radical leftist organizations who solicited the settlement cash from the administration even though they were not parties to the lawsuits, records show. During the Obama administration, groups committed to  revolutionary social change  sent proposals and met with high-level HUD and Justice Department officials to try to get their pieces of the settlement pie,  Cause of Action Institute vice president Julie Smith told The Post.Some of the chosen beneficiaries are now actively militating against the Trump administration and its policies, including:The Hispanic-rights group strenuously protested the Republican-led  skinny  repeal of the Affordable Care Act after receiving at least $1.5 million from the Obama regime s bank settlement funds, congressional researchers say.La Raza works closely with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and has teamed up with the anti-Trump resistance group, Indivisible, which was co-founded by La Raza alumnus Angel Padilla. Indivisible is working with La Raza and its affiliates to make sure  any bill that punishes sanctuary cities never goes to Trump s desk to become law.  They are encouraging activists to send postcards with pre-printed messages on immigration and health care to moderate GOP senators.NATIONAL URBAN LEAGUEAfter receiving at least $1.2 million from the bank-settlement slush fund, the African-American advocacy group solicited its supporters to oppose efforts to repeal ObamaCare by signing a letter to senators arguing  African-Americans stand to be disproportionately impacted.  It claimed more than 5 million black people would lose coverage under repeal legislation.NATIONAL COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT COALITIONSince hauling in at least $2.6 million in funds under settlement in the Obama-era mortgage suits, the liberal housing-rights group has slammed tax-reform proposals by the Trump administration as unfair, while trying to block efforts to privatize mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, claiming doing so would  deepen the racial wealth gap. NCRC is also actively lobbying against regulatory repeal of many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.The Washington-based group boasts more than 600 member organizations who lobby lawmakers through list-serves, mailings, sign-on letters and conference calls. Though it s assumed that funds distributed to such  qualified organizations  will be used for housing assistance, the bank-settlement agreements do not enforce how the funds are spent. It stands to reason that some of the settlement funds have helped bankroll the resistance  bent on stopping the Trump agenda for America, Competitive Enterprise Institute senior fellow John Berlau said.It s not clear how much money, in all, has been diverted from settlement funds to these and other left-wing organizations. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered a full audit of the funds while discontinuing the practice of funneling Justice Department settlements to third-party groups. Any settlement funds should go first to the victims and then to the American people [through the US Treasury]   not to bankroll third-party special interest groups or the political friends of whoever is in power,  Sessions said in a recent statement.Still, The Post has learned that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau continues to force financial institutions it prosecutes to donate to third-party community organizers. More, penalties in such cases are deposited into the Bureau s now-$170 million-plus Civil Penalty Fund, which has, in turn, channeled almost $30 million to  consumer advocacy  groups.For entire story: NYP ",politics,"Sep 24, 2017",1

 Mainstream Media Gets Called Out For Manipulating Bernie Sanders’ NY Daily News Interview,"New York Daily News stooped incredibly low on April 6, by running a cover story using parts of an interview Bernie Sanders had with the paper s editorial board out of context to attack him.Despite their interview never mentioning Sandy Hook, the article, featuring two Connecticut Hillary Clinton supporters, attacked Bernie Sanders over a false assumption he is against gun manufacturers being sued.In the interview Senator Sanders outlined his gun control agenda, comparing it to President Obama s. When asked whether gun manufacturers should be susceptible to lawsuits (not should they receive immunity), Bernie Sanders said  no   while his explanation was largely omitted. In the same sense that if you re a gun dealer and you sell me a gun and I go out and I kill him [gestures to someone in room]. Do I think that that gun dealer should be sued for selling me a legal product that he misused? [Shakes head no.] But I do believe that gun manufacturers and gun dealers should be able to be sued when they should know that guns are going into the hands of wrong people,  said Senator Sanders.  So if somebody walks in and says,  I d like 10,000 rounds of ammunition,  you know, well, you might be suspicious about that. So I think there are grounds for those suits, but not if you sell me a legal product. Bernie Sanders went on to add he has a D-minus rating from the NRA and lost an election in 1988 by three points against an opponent who was backed by the NRA. Trying to lie and portray Bernie Sanders as an NRA-backed candidate is preposterous, especially while Hillary Clinton has a former NRA lobbyist, Jeff Forbes, co-hosting fundraisers for her.Gun control is a hot issue among Democrats, and the mainstream media is misrepresenting Bernie Sanders  record to favor Hillary Clinton when their agendas are virtually identical, but rather than sensationalize and further divide people on the issue, Bernie Sanders emphasizes prevention.Lawsuits are not meant to replace or make up for ground where legislation or laws have yet to be enacted. If any dealer or manufacturer acts within the confines of the law, they can t be held accountable in a lawsuit, whether it is guns or any other product.Other parts of the NY Daily News interview have been taken out of context and manipulated by mainstream media. CNN was recently called out for making it seem as though Bernie Sanders was confused about how he would break up the big banks. He wasn t and isn t. On CNN, Nomiki Konst corrected an uninformed CNN anchor on what Bernie Sanders said. Well actually, you know, there s great fact checking done on this in the New York Times, which I hold as a higher standard of a paper  I think most New Yorkers hold the Times a little bit higher than the Daily News and New York Post. But they fact checked this and they basically said that he was right on this. You know the point if you read the entire transcript, which is very long, took about 45 minutes to read. He went into detail about how the determination of how to break up the big banks lies within Congress or the president, and the president gives authority to the Fed.The problem is that we take, as we do in the media, take little bits out of context and don t show the full picture. And to be clear, to be even more fair, Bernie Sanders is the only Senator who brought this up in Congress  And you know what? The Daily News didn t talk about that, but the New York Times did. The mainstream media needs to stop taking the New York Daily News interview out of context to suit its agenda in trying to stop the surging Bernie Sanders.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 7, 2016",1
Australian women go pro on back of investment boom,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Lisa De Vanna once had to wash her sports bras in the sinks of cheap hotels to save money but the footballer is now relishing the good times as a surge of investment transforms women’s professional sport in Australia.  Over the last few months, De Vanna and her team mates in the ‘Matildas’ national soccer team have become the toast of the nation, playing to bumper home crowds even as their male counterparts struggle to qualify for the World Cup. The 2-1 defeat of Brazil in Sydney last Saturday drew some 15,000 fans, more than one of the weekend’s playoff matches in the hugely popular men’s Australian Football League and a rugby union international between Australia and Argentina. Another victory over the Brazilians on Tuesday attracted an even bigger crowd and, on Wednesday, Victoria sports minister John Eren proudly trumpeted that the state would host two Matildas friendlies against China in November. The recent success of the Matildas has played its part in the explosion of interest but it also echoes the development of women’s professional leagues in cricket and Australian Rules football, the popular indigenous sport. The large swell of support for a once-neglected outfit has been surreal for De Vanna, who after playing the 2007 World Cup had to return to her job as a petrol station attendant. Until quite recently, conditions were still “crap” for the country’s top women players, the plainspoken De Vanna told Reuters, using a more profane term to describe her early playing days. “I came in when they just had the (professional) contracts,” the prolific 32-year-old striker said in an interview. “I was still wearing boy’s clothes, still washing my undies and bras in the sink. We didn’t have internet, we were staying in budget hotels. “It was really tough back then but what we had was the love for the game and that hasn’t changed. “What’s changed is that we’ve got the proper support to be better athletes and it took a very long time for it to happen. But you’ve seen the outcome.” Basic salaries for women footballers in the domestic W-League remain modest, even if they are expected to double to A$15,500 ($12,300) next season. Top internationals, however, can expect to earn a respectable A$130,000 a year, giving young girls hope of carving out a full-time professional career — aspirations that were until recently only the province of talented boys. Cricket is another sport with growing opportunities for women.        Under the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement, the average pay of international cricketers will more than double to A$180,000 in the 2017/18 season, according to figures from governing body Cricket Australia (CA). State players, on average, can expect A$55,000 and will be able to top that up by playing in the third season of the women’s Big Bash Twenty20 league. Underlining confidence in the women’s game, tickets for this year’s women’s Ashes cricket series against England will be sold for the first time rather than given away for free. CA has made significant investment in women’s sport and chief executive James Sutherland is “very confident” it will ultimately pay for itself. “I’m not under any illusions that success will come overnight,” Sutherland told Reuters. “That’s not the case. Beyond the economics of building demand and having the game pay for itself, either way, it’s still good economics to be investing into women’s cricket in the way that we do. “(It’s) increasing the profile of the game and creating a clear and obvious pathway for young females to pursue as they have so many choices.” Another pathway that has opened up only recently is in the women’s Australian Football League (AFLW), which proved a roaring success in its inaugural season this year. The AFL, the governing body of top flight Australian Rules football, had planned to launch the competition in 2020 but took the plunge after huge crowds turned out at exhibition games.   Debbie Lee, women’s football operations manager at the Melbourne Demons club and a key architect of the AFLW, had to pay to play her 300-odd games in the full-contact sport but women players can now earn up to A$40,000 a season. Free-to-air TV broadcasts of games have helped boost the tournament but its development is largely driven by a new wave of fans, Lee said. “There’s a whole swell of support from a new generation of young people who are asking, ‘Why shouldn’t women play football? Why shouldn’t have they have these opportunities, the same opportunities as men?’” New competition between the women’s sports is welcomed across the board by national federations, who see a chance to tap into new markets while fulfilling pledges to boost equal opportunity. But the rivalry may eventually get heated as the battle for talent heats up. Just like in the men’s sports, where rival codes fight bitterly to retain and lure marquee players, the movements of top women athletes are now covered closely in major newspapers. Former Matildas goalkeeper Brianna Davey played domestic soccer for Melbourne City last year but switched codes to play as a defender for Carlton in the AFLW. “It’s going to be really interesting,” said Lee. “Other sports will realize if they don’t have a good deal, they’ll lose their players.”  ",politicsNews,"September 21, 2017 ",0
BARACK OBAMA GOES THERE…Compares President Trump To Hitler In Front Of Chicago Audience,"Crains Chicago Business   American democracy is fragile, and unless care is taken it could follow the path of Nazi Germany in the 1930s.Mixed in with many softer comments, that was the somewhat jaw-dropping bottom line of Barack Obama last night as, in a Q&A session before the Economic Club of Chicago, the Chicagoan who used to be president dropped a bit of red meat to a hometown crowd that likely is a lot closer to him than the man whose name never was mentioned: President Donald Trump.Obama s comments came after a series of playful questions from moderator and Ariel Investments President Mellody Hobson in the great Batman vs. Superman debate, for instance, we learned Obama sides with Batman before she eventually asked him what he s learned as a world citizen of sorts.One thing he s learned is that  things don t happen internationally if we don t put our shoulder to the wheel,  Obama said, speaking of the U.S.  No other country has the experience and bandwith and ideals. . . .If the U.S. doesn t do it, it s not going to happen. Obama gave one specific example, but it was a solid one: Ebola. To fight the virus the U.S. did everything from build an airport tarmac in Africa to send in medical teams and ferry medicos from other countries.  We probably saved a million lives by doing that,  he said.At least indirectly, those comments could be seen as criticism of Trump, whose foreign policy focuses on an  America first  paradigm that critics say distracts from this country s unique role.Obama moved from that to talking about a nativist mistrust and unease that has swept around the world. He argued that such things as the speed of technical change and the uneven impact of globalization have come too quickly to be absorbed in many cultures, bringing strange new things and people to areas in which  people didn t (used to) challenge your assumptions.  As a result,  nothing feels solid,  he said.  Sadly, there s something in us that looks for simple answers when we re agitated. Still, the U.S. has survived tough times before and will again, he noted, particularly mentioning the days of communist fighter Joseph McCarthy and former President Richard Nixon. But one reason the country survived is because it had a free press to ask questions, Obama added. Though he has problems with the media just like Trump has had,  what I understood was the principle that the free press was vital. The danger is  grow(ing) complacent,  Obama said.  We have to tend to this garden of democracy or else things could fall apart quickly. That s what happened in Germany in the 1930s which, despite the democracy of the Weimar Republic and centuries of high-level cultural and scientific achievements, Adolph Hitler rose to dominate, Obama noted.  Sixty million people died. . . .So, you ve got to pay attention. And vote. ",left-news,"Dec 6, 2017",1

" Former GOP Congressman TRASHES Paul Ryan: If Trump Were A Dem, You’d Impeach Him","Now that fired FBI Director James Comey has offered explosive testimony to the Intelligence Committee of the United States Senate, Republicans are scrambling to defend Trump and try to make excuses for what could very well be obstruction of justice. Very few of them are willing to break ranks and criticize Trump, when they know damn well that if this were Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama, they d be howling for impeachment posthaste. Well, there is one Republican who is willing to call them out on it: Former Congressman Bob Inglis.Rep. Inglis took to Twitter after a story was posted about House Speaker Paul Ryan claiming that he wouldn t impeach a Democrat if that person were to do the same things that Trump has engaged in. In a series of tweets, Inglis trashed Ryan for lying:.@SpeakerRyan you know this isn't true. You know that you would be inquiring into impeachment if this were a D. https://t.co/mBFn4aCGi4  Bob Inglis (@bobinglis) June 9, 2017.@SpeakerRyan, no, it isn't time to draft Articles of Impeachment. But it is time to pursue the Russia investigation with vigor.  Bob Inglis (@bobinglis) June 9, 2017.@SpeakerRyan and if the investigation leads to the Pres., his family or his campaign, so be it. Don't obstruct justice. Put country first.  Bob Inglis (@bobinglis) June 9, 2017Inglis is correct, of course. Elected Republicans are being craven, cowardly weasels right now. They are putting their party and their political futures ahead of their country while the nation and the world burn under Trump s criminal behavior, rank ignorance, and stunning incompetence. Further, if this were Hillary Clinton, they know they d be trying to find something   anything   to remove her from office. Hell, they d do that even if she didn t do anything wrong. In fact, House Oversight Chair Jason Chaffetz said that he had years of investigations lined up and waiting for Hillary when it seemed sure that she would win. They d be calling for her removal the second she took her hand off the Bible whether she did anything wrong or not. They ve admitted as much.In short, more elected Republicans need to grow a spine and admit the mistake they have made for the nation and the world, and do something about Donald Trump while we still have a nation left to save.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"June 11, 2017",1
 Watch Seth Meyers’ Hilarious And Convincing Argument About Trump’s Chances In The Primaries (VIDEO),"With the Republican primaries less then a month away, Donald Trump has started to spend millions on his campaign. While the billionaire can throw plenty of money at Trump-style racist and crazy television ads, he s already received lots of free media attention and leads in most polls. However, late night talk show host Seth Meyers isn t convinced. Myers said: But here s the thing about those polls: There s reason to think they might not really mean anything. One reason is that people hate talking to pollsters   the response rate has fallen from 90 percent to a dismal 8 percent, according to one study, which is a lower response rate than student-loan collector and mother-in-law. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zmnGlWjFWM]Meyers said that there s a correlation with Trump saying  outrageous and offensive things  and the media coverage he receives. The enormous attention he s getting  in combination with these polls makes it seems like Trump is the winning horse. But Meyers isn t buying it. Rudolph Giuliani had a three point lead for the Republican nomination and Howard Dean had a whopping 15 point lead and both went on to fade. For all of us very concerned folks out there that Trump has a shot at the presidency, here are more examples that give us hope that Trump will also fade.In 2007, Hillary Clinton was the clear front runner, polling ahead of John Kerry and John Edwards and she had a huge advantage over Barack Obama by 15 points from January all the way through June. In 2003, Joe Lieberman led in most polls of the Democratic primary but he lost to John Kerry.So, it all comes down to the people who go out and vote and not the polls that precede an election. In one of his speeches that Meyers broadcasts, Trump says,  If I don t win, I will consider this, and I mean it, a total and complete waste of time.  As Meyers said and as I m sure most of the readers out there also think, Trump,  you are not alone. Featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 5, 2016",1
" ‘Responsible Gun Owner’ Holds Children At Gunpoint, Lectures Them About Crime","On Wednesday, three young Washington teens received a terrifying  lesson  from one of the people the NRA says will save us from any and all danger. Kitsap Sheriff s deputies are investigating an incident in which a man held three 13-year-olds at gunpoint while he lectured them about crime in the area.The teens, who were playing an innocent game of basketball in a community court, say the man approached them. According to the kids, he had been dropped off by another man in a silver pickup truck with orange cab lights. He shined a flashlight at the children then pointed a semi-automatic pistol and told them he was not  playing around,  ordering them face-down on the ground.The Kitsap Sun reports that the man, who is described as a caucasian in his 60s or 70s with white hair, interrogated them about what they were doing, and informed the frightened teens that there had been a rash of car thefts and vandalism in the area. He told the kids he had been asked to  investigate  by a neighbor.After the interrogation, the pickup truck returned and another white man got, heavyset with grayish hair, got out and shook the kids  hands, patting one on the back. The gun-toting gentleman got in the truck and they drove off. Police are still investigating the incident.Unfortunately, this is where we are at in America. Two men, empowered by the NRA and Republicans  rhetoric that places them as judge, jury, and executioner, conducted their own firearm-assisted  interrogation  against three children who had done nothing worse than playing basketball in the evening.

Factbox - What's next for Catalonia's exiled separatist leader?,"MADRID (Reuters) - Exiled Catalan separatist leader Carles Puigdemont looks set to regain power after regional elections on Thursday, but what comes next is unlikely to be an easy ride. - CAN HE GO BACK TO CATALONIA?  Puigdemont is targeted by an arrest warrant for his role in organizing an illegal independence referendum on Oct. 1 and leading the secession bid. He is now in Brussels but he faces arrest the minute he steps foot in Spain. Seven of the 70 separatists elected on Sunday are either in jail or in exile on allegations of sedition and rebellion. Unless they are released or they return home, they cannot vote in parliament to form a workable majority. They could hope to be freed or have arrest warrants dropped if they swore no to pursue independence unilaterally. But that in turn could jeopardize support for a Puigdemont government from Catalonia s most vehement pro-independence party, the CUP. Another option would be for these leaders to forfeit their seats and hand them to the next candidates on the list. Puigdemont cannot take absolutely for granted that he will be Catalonia s next president because the other two separatist parties, the CUP and ERC, have shown some reluctance to put him back at the helm. His party got more votes than the other two.  - WHAT S ON THE AGENDA? Negotiations to form a government are likely to start following a holiday break, after Jan. 6.  Around the same date, conservative Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy will say when regional parliament will begin preliminary proceedings ahead of its first sitting. That process must start no later than Jan. 23. Parliament must then vote by Feb. 8 on putting a new government into place. By then, Puigdemont should also clarify whether he will put himself forward as Catalonia president. If no leader can command an absolute majority of the 135-seat regional assembly, a second vote will be held where a leader only needs a majority of votes cast in the chamber. If that does not work, talks can go on for another two months. If they fail, parliament is dissolved and new elections are held. ",worldnews,"December 22, 2017 ",0

World Food Programme cuts rations for refugees in Kenya,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - The U.N. World Food Programme is cutting food rations by 30 percent for more than 400,000 refugees living in camps in Kenya due to insufficient funding, it said on Monday. Dadaab and Kakuma camps in Kenya are primarily home to refugees from neighboring Somalia and South Sudan, both ravaged by wars that have forced millions of people to flee.  The World Food Programme said it needed $28.5 million to cover the food assistance needs of the 420,000 refugees living in the camps for the next six months.   An abrupt halt to food assistance would be devastating for the refugees, most of whom rely fully on WFP for their daily meals,  said Annalisa Conte, the top WFP official in Kenya.  The funding shortfall comes six months after the United Nations warned that the world was facing its greatest humanitarian disaster since World War Two because of the threat of famine in South Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria and Yemen. It said in March that 20 million people risked starvation in what it called largely man-made hunger crises in addition to drought.   The Famine Early Warning Systems Network said in a report last month that risk of famine persists in parts of Somalia due to the extended drought and disease outbreaks.

Senators look to new sanctions against Iran for missile development,"MUNICH (Reuters) - U.S. Republican senators plan to introduce legislation to impose further sanctions on Iran, accusing it of violating U.N. Security Council resolutions by testing ballistic missiles and acting to “destabilise” the Middle East, a U.S. senator said Sunday. “I think it is now time for the Congress to take Iran on directly in terms of what they’ve done outside the nuclear program,” Senator Lindsey Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told the Munich Security Conference. Graham said he and other Republicans would introduce measures to hold Iran accountable for its actions.     Tensions between Tehran and Washington have risen since an  Iranian ballistic missile test that prompted U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration to impose sanctions on individuals and entities linked to the country’s Revolutionary Guards. “Iran is a bad actor in the greatest sense of the word when it comes to the region. To Iran, I say, if you want us to treat you differently then stop building missiles, test-firing them in defiance of U.N. resolution and writing ‘Death to Israel’ on the missile. That’s a mixed message,” Graham said. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif told the conference earlier on Sunday that Iran did not respond well to sanctions or threats. James Jones, a former Supreme Allied Commander in Europe and President Barack Obama’s first national security adviser, told a separate event in Munich that he remained convinced that sanctions had persuaded Iran to negotiate the 2015 landmark deal with six world powers to curb its nuclear program. “The sanctions did work. Iran would never have come to the negotiating table without sanctions,” Jones said. “This is a new form of response that if properly utilized can change behavior and get people to do things that they otherwise wouldn’t do.” Senator Christopher Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told the same panel there was nothing preventing Congress from imposing sanctions beyond those that were lifted as a result of the 2016 nuclear agreement with Iran. Murphy, a Democrat, said had backed the nuclear deal in the explicit understanding that it would not prevent Congress from taking actions against Iran outside the nuclear issue. “There’s going to be a conversation about what the proportional response is,” Murphy said, referring to Iran’s missile test. “But I don’t necessarily think there’s going to be partisan division over whether or not we have the ability as a Congress to speak on issues outside of the nuclear agreement.” Murphy said the United States needed to decide whether it wanted to take a broader role in the regional conflict. “We have to make a decision whether we are going to get involved in the emerging proxy war in a bigger way than we are today, between Iran and Saudi,” he said.

REPUBLICAN PROPOSES HOUSE BILL TO FORCE Supreme Court Justices And Employees To Join Obamacare,"Of course, we d be okay with excluding three of the Justices who didn t go along with the rubber stamping of Obama s reckless socialized medicine plan. While we re at it, it s only fair for Barry and his family to be forced to use his signature  Obamacare  insurance plan as well A House Republican on Thursday proposed forcing the Supreme Court justices and their staff to enroll in ObamaCare.Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas) said that his SCOTUScare Act would make all nine justices and their employees join the national healthcare law s exchanges. As the Supreme Court continues to ignore the letter of the law, it s important that these six individuals understand the full impact of their decisions on the American people,  he said.  That s why I introduced the SCOTUScare Act to require the Supreme Court and all of its employees to sign up for ObamaCare,  Babin said.Babin s potential legislation would only let the federal government provide healthcare to the Supreme Court and its staff via ObamaCare exchanges. By eliminating their exemption from ObamaCare, they will see firsthand what the American people are forced to live with,  he added.His move follows the Supreme Court s ruling Thursday morning that upheld the subsidies under ObamaCare that are provided by the government to offset the cost of buying insurance.The 6-3 decision, authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, said consumers purchasing health insurance from the federal exchange in roughly 34 states could continue to do so.The ruling in King v. Burwell has spurred anger on the right, with conservatives questioning the logic of the decision. They deserve an Olympic medal for the legal gymnastics,  Rep. Joe Pitts (R-Pa.), the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee, told The Hill.Roberts argued in his decision that eliminating subsidies would have pulled state healthcare markets into a death spiral. That chain of effects, he added, was not consistent with ObamaCare s intent. The argument that the phrase  established by the State  would be superfluous if Congress meant to extend tax credits to both State and Federal Exchanges is unpersuasive,  he wrote.Justice Antonin Scalia strongly criticized that interpretation in his dissent. We should start by calling this law SCOTUScare,  he wrote, lambasting Roberts for the ObamaCare decision in 2012 declaring the law s mandate that people buy insurance constitutional.Via: The Hill ",politics,"Jun 26, 2015",1
U.S. spy agencies to begin top secret Trump briefings within days,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. intelligence agencies will soon begin giving President-elect Donald Trump the same top secret national security briefings they give President Barack Obama, current and former intelligence officials said Wednesday. The briefings by veteran career intelligence analysts, which will begin in the next few days, will include some of the government’s most closely-guarded secrets, including details of undercover espionage operations and classified intelligence collection methods, including the National Security Agency’s controversial eavesdropping operations, the officials said. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which will be in charge of Trump’s briefings, had no immediate comment. “I’m certain the intelligence agencies will approach these briefings with absolute professionalism,” said John McLaughlin, a former Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency who participated in presidential briefings. “Once the American people have chosen a president he or she is entitled to complete support from intelligence, and intelligence agencies have to assume that a president-elect will be equally professional,” McLaughlin said.  He added: “I have seen the transformation that occurs when candidates become presidents and realize the awesome responsibility that rests on them. We can only hope it happens again.” “The president-elect has received the final anointing by the American people, and is the person the intelligence community knows it will be serving over the next four years,” said Paul Pillar, a former senior CIA analyst. “There is every reason to be as thorough and forthcoming briefing the president-elect as in briefing the incumbent president.” Not long after Trump was confirmed as the Republican presidential nominee, intelligence officials gave him and a small team of advisors two general briefings on threats and foreign policy issues facing the United States. Those pre-election briefings contained some classified information, but not anything about covert operations or intelligence-collection methods. ",politicsNews,"November 10, 2016 ",0
Qatar retools after boycott by top auto parts supplier Dubai,"DOHA (Reuters) - In a dusty industrial zone in the south of Doha where the city s auto repair shops are clustered, one unlucky blue Hyundai Santa Fe has been sitting with its front smashed in since June 5, the day four Arab nations announced a boycott of Qatar.  The SUV has fallen foul of the tiny state s dependence on Jebel Ali in neighboring Dubai, the first port of call for car companies distributing spare parts across the region but no longer an option for Doha since its neighbors severed ties. The United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia accused Qatar of supporting terrorism, which it denies.   With its traditional land, sea and air trade routes cut off, Doha has had to scramble to find new suppliers to replace everything from Saudi Arabian milk to Emirati engine oil. It also has had to quickly pull together complicated new logistics, involving a mix of new air and maritime routes and use of nearby ports in Oman and Kuwait for re-export. In many ways it has been a success. The boycott, which entered its sixth month this week, touches life on the streets only in minor ways, with Turkish dairy and Iranian vegetables taking the place of Arab foodstuffs on store shelves. Items are generally available and prices only modestly higher. One exception has been auto parts, residents say. In car-obsessed Qatar, where status symbol Bentleys and BMWs zip down the Doha corniche at night, spare parts that once arrived in days from Dubai can now take weeks or even months, leaving vehicles languishing in shops and drivers frustrated. A manager at one American automobile dealership in the industrial area, who asked not to be named, described the situation as desperate.  You have customers coming in and screaming, saying  my car has been here two to three months.  And you re just helpless. What do you say?   Although most imports have recovered to near pre-crisis levels after dropping sharply on the boycott, auto imports in September were 40 percent lower than their year-earlier level.         The manager said attempts to re-route orders from Jebel Ali to Oman and Kuwait for re-export were abandoned because paying two sets of customs fees and additional shipping spiked costs 20 to 40 percent. The situation has improved in recent weeks after the dealership moved to import directly by air from the United States, he said, but the process took months to set up.  Until ten days ago we didn t have batteries or oil. We were taking batteries out of the new cars.  Some 58 percent of imports to Qatar were either produced in or shipped from the four boycotting countries in 2016, according to a Ministry of Development Planning and Statistics estimate. How much of that is autos and auto parts was not possible to determine, but two parts businesses in Doha said about 80 percent of their supplies previously came through Jebel Ali.  The boycott has driven a campaign to make the country less dependent on its Gulf Arab rivals even if the boycott ends. Hundreds of cows have been flown in to scale up dairy farms that traditionally competed with Saudi Arabia, trade ties have increased with Turkey and Iran, and a draft law was passed that would grant greater trade protection to local producers. The legislation is still pending.  Nobody will buy from Dubai even if it opens up. Why would we let Dubai take any profit from us?  said a spare parts dealer whose goods are now sourced from Vietnam and Korea.  At a high-end garage where a cream Porsche 911 Turbo awaited repair, the general manager said his shop has in recent months established direct import links with European suppliers,  cutting down average delivery time to about three weeks, about twice as long as before the boycott.  It s taught all of us how to import because we have to find new sources ... even if this story ends and the blockade is lifted, we won t go back to buying from Dubai,  he said.

U.S. Commerce secretary says Trump did not endorse border tax plan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said President Donald Trump did not endorse a proposed border tax system on Tuesday in  his first speech to Congress on Tuesday, despite a vow to level the tax playing field for U.S. companies that export. Ross, speaking to reporters after the speech, said that Trump was merely pointing out an export tax inequity between the United States and many other countries, not specifying how it should be remedied. Trump said he was asking for a change in the way U.S. imports are taxed, saying that other countries “make us pay very high tariffs and taxes,” but the United States charges “nothing or almost nothing” on imports. Trump referred to tariffs of 100 percent by some countries on U.S.-made Harley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N) motorcycles, saying that the company was used to being “mistreated” in foreign markets. “They weren’t even asking for a change, but I am,” Trump told the joint session of Congress. Asked if Trump’s remarks on the topic effectively endorsed a  plan by House of Representatives Republicans to levy a border tax of about 20 percent on imports into the United States, Ross said, “No, he did not.” “What he addressed was the issue that needs to be solved,  which is there’s inequitable treatment of the U.S. Other countries have a value-added tax which they rebate on exports,” Ross said. He said the World Trade Organization has turned down past U.S. requests to allow American companies to deduct income taxes paid on exports. The proposed border tax is under attack from import-heavy businesses but is supported by large exporters, such as manufacturers. “Border advisability, other programs are possible ways of solving that. But I didn’t hear him coming out clearly in favor of any one system,” said Ross, who was sworn in earlier on Tuesday. Trump has not clearly endorse or opposed the border tax proposal, although he spoke favorably of it in a Reuters interview. He has also called the proposal “too complicated.” Asked if WTO compliance was a crucial factor in the solution, Ross, a billionaire investor and corporate turnaround expert, said that the first negotiation over export tax would be with Congress.

 Bernie Sanders Consoles Sister Of Police Violence Victim In Emotional Backstage Discussion (VIDEO),"On April 11th, before he spoke at his rally in Albany, New York, Bernie Sanders met with local Black Lives Matter activists.  The local police department has a long history of corruption and abuse. In April 2015, Albany Police Officers killed unarmed 39-year-old Dontay Ivy. While he was walking home from an ATM they tasered him and beat him to death with police batons. Mr. Ivy was mentally ill. In the video, his aunt takes Bernie Sanders through what happened. No officers were charged in the death and a grand jury found no criminal wrongdoing because of a lack of witnesses. Allegedly the dash cams in the patrol cars were turned off. I worried about my brother all the time. I thought outside elements would hurt him. But the people who were supposed to protect him, they re the ones who hurt him,  Dontay Ivy s sister, Johnson, told Senator Sanders in tears.Bernie Sanders has lead the call for police reform in the Democratic Primaries. He was the only candidate who called for a Department of Justice investigation in December 2015 after it was announced there would be no indictment of the police officers involved. He was the only candidate who called for Mayor Rahm Emanuel to resign over his administration s overt cover up of unarmed teenager LaQuan MacDonald s death. Bernie Sanders is the only candidate who has proposed that the Department of Justice investigates every death caused by police involvement or in police custody so police departments can t cover up the incidents or protect their own from being held accountable for their actions. I got the racial profiling issues, I got it. And I got the need for police reform. What we should be doing is training police officers to deal with issues, although this doesn t seem to be a terribly difficult issue, this is not like somebody with a weapon or anything. It s a guy walking down the street, right? Going home. It s not exactly a major crime,  Bernie Sanders told the group backstage. What we don t have yet is a culture in this country that says to the police departments that lethal force, in this case using a Taser several times is a last resort, not a first resort, right? Clearly, in this particular case, it can be dealt with in a hundred different ways. The full video below, released by the Albany chapter of Black Lives Matter, shows the group s entire discussion backstage at the Washington Avenue Armory in Albany, New York. https://www.facebook.com/BLMUpstateNY/videos/1084906804903398/Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 15, 2016",1
 Jason Chaffetz Prepares To Run For The Hills As The Russia Probe Heats Up (DETAILS),"Earlier this year, Jason Chaffetz, the House Oversight Chairman who carried around a two year obsession when it came to investigating Hillary Clinton, suddenly shocked Washington when he announced that he will not run for another term in Congress in 2018. Now that the probe into Trump s ties to Russia is getting too hot for a lot of Republicans to handle, it is being reported that Chaffetz won t even finish his term. In fact, according to Politico, he could be gone by June 30.Now, this development comes just one day after former FBI Director Robert Mueller has been named as a special counsel into the Russia probe. This is most curious, seeing how just last year, Chaffetz showed the world just how much he likes investigating people. In fact, he once said he had years of investigations lined up for Hillary, had she won the presidency. However, now that it s his guy in the Oval Office, Chaffetz suddenly has no interest in sticking around to see this thing through to the end.Could it be that Chaffetz knows that Trump s days are numbered, and he doesn t want to be around with the rest of the Republicans who are ending their careers by keeping their wagons firmly hitched to the disaster that is Donald Trump? Or, could it be that Chaffetz himself knows more than he is letting on? After all, it just leaked that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and House Speaker Paul Ryan knew that Trump was being paid by the Russians and tried to cover it up.This scandal could be coursing through the entire Republican Party, and by the time we get to the bottom of it all, they might all find themselves on the wrong side of the law and going down in flames.Good going, GOP. You see what you ve done to your party and to the nation by backing the treasonous Trump? If the rest of you had any sense, you d be resigning before the shit hits the fan just like Jason Chaffetz.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 18, 2017",1
"U.S. wants stronger India economic, defense ties given China's rise: Tillerson","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said before a visit to India next week that the Trump administration wanted to  dramatically deepen  cooperation with New Delhi, seeing it as a key partner in the face of negative Chinese influence in Asia. Speaking on Wednesday, less than a month before President Donald Trump is due to make his first state visit to China, Tillerson said the United States had begun to discuss creating alternatives to Chinese infrastructure financing in Asia. In another comment likely to upset Beijing, he said Washington saw room to invite others, including Australia, to join U.S.-India-Japan security cooperation, something Beijing has opposed as an attempt by democracies to gang up on it. The remarks coincide with the start of a week-long Chinese Communist Party congress at which President Xi Jinping is seeking to further consolidate his power.  The United States seeks constructive relations with China, but we will not shrink from China s challenges to the rules-based order and where China subverts the sovereignty of neighboring countries and disadvantages the U.S. and our friends,  Tillerson told the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.  India and the United States should be in the business of equipping other countries to defend their sovereignty, build greater connectivity, and have a louder voice in a regional architecture that promotes their interests and develops their economies,  Tillerson added. The U.S. decision to expand relations with India almost certainly will upset India s rival, Pakistan, where Tillerson also will stop next week, said a senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Pakistan was the main U.S. ally in South Asia for decades, but U.S. officials are frustrated with what they charge has been Pakistan s failure to cut support for the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan, where the administration wants India to play a bigger role in economic development. As part of a South Asia strategy unveiled by Trump in August, Tillerson is expected to press Islamabad, which denies aiding the Taliban, to take stronger steps against extremists and allied groups and intensify efforts to pressure them to agree to peace talks with Kabul.  We expect Pakistan to take decisive action against terrorist groups based there that threaten its own people and the broader region,  Tillerson said. Trump has threatened further cuts in U.S. aid to Pakistan if it fails to cooperate. China, a strategic rival to the United States and India, is also vital to Trump s efforts to roll back North Korea s efforts to create nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching the United States, an issue expected to top the agenda in Trump s Nov. 8-10 Beijing visit. A senior State Department official defended the timing of the speech, saying Tillerson also said he wanted a constructive relationship with China.  For many decades the United States has supported China s rise,  said the official.  We ve also supported India s rise. But those two countries have risen very differently.  In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China hoped the United States could abandon bias when viewing its actions overseas.  China will never develop itself at the expense of other countries,  Lu told a regular briefing on Thursday.  At the same time we will never give up our justly deserved rights and interests.   Healthy relations between China and the United States are good for the people of both countries and are expected by the Asia-Pacific region, he added. Tillerson did not say what he meant by creating an alternative to Chinese infrastructure financing, but said the Trump administration had begun a  quiet conversation  with some emerging East Asian democracies at a summit in August. He said Chinese financing was saddling countries with  enormous  debts and failing to create jobs.  We think it s important that we begin to develop some means of countering that with alternative financing measures.   We will not be able to compete with the kind of terms that China offers, but countries have to decide what are they willing to pay to secure their sovereignty and their future control of their economies and we ve had those discussions with them as well,  he said.

Trump hustled off stage in Nevada by security agents,"RENO, Nevada (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was hustled off the stage by security agents at a campaign event in Reno on Saturday after a perceived threat in the crowd. Two security agents grabbed Trump by the shoulders and rushed him back stage. The threat was unclear, but a man near the front of the crowd was pounced on by other security agents.

WISCONSIN PRIEST COMES OUT AS “GAY” During Sunday Mass…Gets Standing Ovation…Wait…What?,"In 1992, the Vatican under Pope John Paul II published the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which stated, among many other things, that  homosexual tendencies  are  objectively disordered.  One of the principal theologians who shaped the document was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who would succeed John Paul II as Pope Benedict XVI. He too would take a hard-line stance against homosexuality.Two decades later, Pope Francis has signaled what many believe to be a softening on the matter.In 2013, when asked about gay priests, he famously replied,  Who am I to judge?  He has continued to call for the Catholic Church to treat LGBT people with dignity and respect, and to fight discrimination against sexual minorities.  RNSFrom the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel   The Rev. Gregory Greiten told his congregation Sunday,  I am Greg. I am a Roman Catholic priest. And, yes, I am gay! The priest in the Milwaukee Archdiocese serves as the pastor of St. Bernadette Parish. On Monday, he came out to the rest of the world with a column in the National Catholic Reporter. He received a standing ovation from his parishioners when he made his announcement before the column s publication.Greiten said he was breaking the silence of gay men in the clergy so he could reclaim his own voice.While it is established that there are gay men who serve as priests, it is rare for a priest to come out to his congregation in this way. Greiten shares an estimate in his article that there are between 8,554 and 21,571 gay Catholic priests in the United States from  The Changing Face of the Priesthood.  Church theology teaches that acting upon homosexuality is a sin.In announcing his identity as a gay man, Greiten chastised the Catholic Church for its stance on homosexuality.He wrote: By choosing to enforce silence, the institutional church pretends that gay priests and religious do not really exist. Because of this, there are no authentic role models of healthy, well-balanced, gay, celibate priests to be an example for those, young and old, who are struggling to come to terms with their sexual orientation. This only perpetuates the toxic shaming and systemic secrecy. NYP-Greiten wrote that has decided to stand with the  few courageous priests who have taken the risk to come out of the shadows and have chosen to live in truth and authenticity. The church s silent stance on gay priests perpetuates toxic shaming and systematic secrecy, Greiten wrote. The church needs healthy role models for priests who are struggling to come to terms with their sexual orientation, he said.Greiten met with Milwaukee Archbishop Jerome Listecki before coming out, according to an archdiocese spokeswoman. We support Father Greiten in his own personal journey and telling his story of coming to understand and live with his sexual orientation,  Listecki said in a statement Monday.  As the Church teaches, those with same-sex attraction must be treated with understanding and compassion. ",politics,"Dec 20, 2017",1

BROTHER OF SETH RICH Works For Cyber Security Firm…Reportedly BLOCKED Family’s Private Investigator From Determining If Seth Was Wikileaks Source…Refused To Let Investigator See Seth’s Computer: “I already checked it…Don’t worry about it”,"What the heck is going on? Why is the media, who has been virtually silent about former DNC staffer Seth Rich s death until now, coming out to attack President Trump and his administration, accusing them of pushing a false narrative about his murder? Shouldn t every American regardless of political affiliation want to get to the bottom of Rich s suspicious death? Why is there so much secrecy and mystery surrounding the staffer who was getting ready to move over to the Hillary campaign when he was murdered on the streets of DC, only blocks from his home early in the morning, after he was last seen leaving a local bar he frequented. The DC police called it a robbery. The  robbers  didn t take his wallet, the contents of his wallet or his expensive watch.Aaron Rich, who had reportedly been blocking his family s private investigator from looking into whether or not his brother Seth was a WikiLeaks source, works for an influential defense contractor that provides cyber security.According to a source close to the Rich family, Aaron works for Northrup Grumman, which was named as the fifth-largest defense contractor in the world in 2015. The source did not provide what his specific role is at the company. It s not just hacking and defending, there s a lot more to it,  a cyber software engineer at Northrup Grumman says in a video on the company s website.As we previously reported, Aaron Rich was actively attempting to shut down anyone looking into the WikiLeaks connection according to Rod Wheeler, who was brought on as a private investigator in his brother s murder case.Wheeler said that brother Aaron Rich tried to block Wheeler from looking at Seth s computer, even though there could be evidence on it.  He said no, he said I have his computer, meaning him,  Wheeler said.  I said, well can I look at it? He said, what are you looking for? I said anything that could indicate if Seth was having problems with someone. He said no, I already checked it. Don t worry about it. Aaron also blocked Wheeler from finding out about who was at a party Seth attended the night of the murder. All I want you to do is work on the botched robbery theory and that s it,  Aaron told Wheeler, according to Wheeler s claim on the audio. Wheeler said that Seth s father Joel  does not appear to have any hidden agenda. Rich was shot in the back in the early morning hours of July 10, 2016, near his home while he was on the phone with his girlfriend   12 days before the publication of the DNC emails by WikiLeaks. The police initially ruled that it was a botched robbery   but his wallet, watch, and necklace were still on his person when he was discovered by police.Big League Politics has also released an audio recording of journalist Seymour Hersh stating that Seth Rich was in fact WikiLeaks  source.Listen to the Seymour Hersh interview here: All I know is that he offered a sample, an extensive sample, I m sure dozens of emails, and said  I want money.  Later, WikiLeaks did get the password, he had a DropBox, a protected DropBox,  he said. They got access to the DropBox. Hersh also states that Rich had concerns about something happening to him,  the word was passed, according to the NSA report, he also shared this DropBox with a couple of friends, so that  if anything happens to me it s not going to solve your problems,  he added.  WikiLeaks got access before he was killed. For entire story: Big League Politics ",Government News,"Aug 2, 2017",1
Obama takes on role of America's pitchman at German trade show,"HANOVER, Germany (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama slipped on on a pair of virtual reality glasses bedecked with plastic googly eyes and mused about someday using the technology to talk with his daughter after she leaves home for college. The display was but one of many stops on a two-hour tour of Hanover Messe, the world’s largest trade show of industrial technology, and a tour de force of economic diplomacy by Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. “It’s a brave new world,” Obama said, doffing the glasses, and moving on to the next elaborate booth. Obama often tours American businesses and factories - and often spends time with world leaders - but the marathon tour with Merkel was a sign of how much the leaders want to conclude talks on an EU-U.S. trade deal before Obama’s presidency ends on Jan. 20. “This is another chance for me to tell everyone to come here and buy ‘Made in America,’” Obama said. The high-profile visit was a way to promote the benefits of trade for the economy, said Michael Froman, the U.S. Trade representative, who is negotiating the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). “It helps underscore you can’t build walls around the U.S.,” Froman said in an interview. Merkel personally invited Obama to feature U.S. businesses at the trade fair and almost 400 U.S. businesses were represented. At times, the tour resembled a protracted television infomercial with the leaders gripping hand-held microphones to ask exhibitors about their products. A herd of photographers galloped from station to station to keep up. “Chancellor Merkel is a scientist so she can figure this out very quickly,” Obama said as they examined the Gekko Gripper, a modest silver device able to grab hold of space debris. “It reminds me of Spiderman,” Obama said. “Does it have any earthbound application?” At the Siemens booth, Chief Executive Joe Kaeser presented Obama with a pair of golf clubs designed using the company’s software, a nod to the president’s favorite weekend pastime. “I’m going to teach Angela how to play,” Obama said before posing for a photo. Several stops featured 3-D printers. Obama joked he might soon buy one and start designing things. “When I get out of office, I’m going to have a lot of time on my hands,” he said.

CNN’S DRAMA QUEEN HOST Tears Up After Reading Letter To Trump On-Air [Video],"CNN s Don Lemon gave an OSCAR-worthy performance on air when he teared up after reading his  open letter  to President Trump in response to Trump s tweet attempting to respond to charges from the widow of a fallen soldier who was killed in Niger earlier this month. Lemon is further politicizing the phone call from President Trump to the widow. Shame on him.Myeshia Johnson, the widow of Sgt.

President Trump responded to Myeshia Johnson s account on Twitter, writing,  I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sgt.

Johnson s interview and Trump s subsequent tweet led Lemon to write Trump an open letter, which read in part:Your tweet this morning essentially called her a liar.Mr. Trump, please stop it.

 Secret Memo Shows That Every Single Congressman Could Be Hit In Russian Investigation,"Yet another day and yet another leak. A secret Republican National Committee memo was released on Monday that shows that Republicans are preparing for what may be inevitable. They may all be implicated, or at least investigated, in the growing Russian scandal.According to a Buzzfeed report, the RNC has issued a memo to their employees telling them to preserve absolutely everything regarding the 2016 election. Given the important role that the RNC plays in national elections and the potentially expansive scope of the inquiries and investigations, it is possible that we will be contacted with requests for information,  reads a July 28 memo to staff from the RNC Counsel s Office. Therefore, we must preserve all documents potentially relevant to these matters until they are resolved or until we are informed by all necessary parties that preservation is no longer necessary. BuzzFeed News obtained a copy of the memo, which orders employees not to  delete, destroy, modify, or remove from your paper files, laptop computer, desktop computer, tablet, mobile device, e-mail, or any storage system or device, any documents, records, or other materials that relate to the 2016 presidential election or that may relate to any investigation concerning the election.  An RNC source confirmed the memo s authenticity Monday morning.Source: BuzzfeedGotta give them credit. At least they aren t telling their minions to shred everything. Perhaps that s in the subtext.The RNC insists that they aren t currently being investigated and that they don t have a specific reason to believe that they will be, but they are taking the measures, just in case. If Russia did hack voting machines, you can be sure that the RNC, along with every GOP Congressman, should be investigated.This is all pretty ironic, given all the hubbub surrounding the Democratic National Committee, who should be laughing all the way to the White House. Instead, they re still drowning their sorrows in vodka tonics over an election that was stolen.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"July 31, 2017",1
"Trump's refugee ban no solution to problems, Turkey PM says","ANKARA (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s sweeping ban on people seeking refuge in the United States is no solution to problems, Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said on Saturday, adding that Western countries should do more to help ease Turkey’s refugee burden. The new Republican president on Friday put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily barred travelers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries, although NATO ally Turkey was not among them. When asked by a reporter about Trump’s ban during a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May in Ankara, Yildirim said: “Regional issues cannot be solved by closing the doors on people. We expect the Western world to lighten Turkey’s burden.” “You can build a wall but it’s not a solution. That wall will come down like the Berlin wall,” he said, adding Turkey has spent some $26 billion on sheltering refugees. May, who met with Trump in Washington a day earlier, told the news conference that the United States was responsible for its position on refugees. She has previously said a “special relationship” between the United States and Britain meant the two countries could speak frankly to each other when they disagreed on issues. [S8N1EY00D] Yildirim said little directly about Trump. “We are not very informed about Trump’s decisions. But problems are solved through dealing with the causes,” he said. Turkey, a member of the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic  State, has been hoping for a reset in its relationship with the Washington under the Trump administration. Ankara was long frustrated by former President Barack Obama’s decision to back a Syrian Kurdish militia. Turkey considers the group a terrorist organization. Turkey is home to the world’s largest refugee population sheltering some 3 million people, most of them Syrians.  ",politicsNews,"January 28, 2017 ",0
"Togo forces fire on protesters, seven wounded","LOME (Reuters) - Security forces in Togo fired bullets and teargas on Thursday, wounding at least seven people as they sought to break up violent protests against the 50-year ruling family dynasty in the West African banking and transport hub. Activists have been demonstrating since August against President Faure Gnassingbe s refusal to give a clear date for stepping aside and to allow opposition parties to flourish in the region s only country that still does not accept presidential term limits. A Reuters cameraman saw trucks carrying armed paramilitary gendarmes drive into crowds and fire volleys of teargas. Protesters in the Lome suburb of Be, flanked by rundown buildings and palm trees, set up barricades, burned tyres and threw stones at the security forces.  We ve received seven people wounded by bullets so far,  said a doctor at the Social Medical Centre in Be, where some were being wrapped in bandages. The former French colony of 8 million people is home to several large firms, including Ecobank and regional airline ASKY, and has undergone major port upgrades as the president has sought to turn the resource-poor nation into a commercial hub. But a history of repression and the monopoly of power by one family - Faure took power in 2005 upon the death of his father Gnassingbe Eyadema, who had ruled for 38 years - threaten its stability.  Ghassingbe s opponents says reforms announced last month, in response to August s protests, will still allow him to run the West African country until 2030. ",worldnews,"October 19, 2017 ",0
TUCKER CARLSON Shocked At Lawyer’s Delusion On Rejection Of Voter ID Law In Texas [Video],"A Texas federal judge appointed by Obama has again rejected the 2011 Texas voter ID law, stating that the legislators meant to discriminate against minority voters.Tucker Carlson interviewed one of the lawyers involved in the case. The reasoning is beyond flawed! The only people being discriminated against are the LEGAL voters of this nation! Why is this activist judge assuming that minorities are being discriminated against? You will find her reasoning to be biased and racist. The Court of Appeals even came back with this statement:  some of the evidence used by the judge wasn t relevant. U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos made this same ruling in 2014, which forced an appeal. The Fifth Circuit issued a stay against the order. The Supreme Court stepped in and allowed Texas to use the voter ID law.But last July the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans asked the judge  to re-examine the decision  since the judges found that  some of the evidence used by the judge wasn t relevant.  The two sides reached a deal for the 2016 election, which allowed a voter to  sign a declaration swearing that he or she has had a reasonable difficulty that prevented obtaining one of the accepted forms of photo identification. Ramos went back to the drawing board but came to the same conclusion.The Texas Tribune reported:After weighing the evidence again, she came to the same conclusion, according to Monday s ruling. Her decision did not identify what some have called a smoking gun showing intent to discriminate, but it cited the state s long history of discrimination;  virtually unprecedented radical departures from normal practices  in fast-tracking the 2011 bill through the Legislature; the legislation s  unduly strict  terms; and lawmakers   shifting rationales  for passing a law that some said was needed to crack down on voter fraud. The Court holds that the evidence found  infirm  did not tip the scales,  Ramos wrote. Civil rights groups and others suing the state offered evidence that  established a discriminatory purpose was at least one of the substantial or motivating factors behind passage of SB 14,  she added.The law requires a voter to use  one of seven forms of identification  when they vote. The voter can use a driver s license, concealed handgun license, military ID, passport, or a state-issued personal ID card.Democrats and civil rights activists claimed the  Republican legislators departed from procedural norms in passing the law, including classifying it as emergency legislation, cutting debate short and bypassing the ordinary committee process in both chambers. But Republican officials, which includes Governor Greg Abbott, insists the law stops voter ID and strengthens the integrity of elections.From The New York Times:They said that the law was aimed at preventing voter fraud and that the departures from the normal legislative process were made to prevent Democratic lawmakers from manipulating procedural rules to thwart passage. They maintained that opponents had turned up no evidence that any legislator had intended to discriminate against blacks and Hispanics.Texas lawmakers have not announced how they ll respond, but they can choose to appeal again.Fox News reported:Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton did not immediately react to the ruling, although the state could once again appeal, which is what one of Paxton s top deputies appeared to suggest would happen while testifying to lawmakers just as the ruling came down. Brantley Starr, a deputy first assistant attorney general, acknowledged that Texas could be dragged back under preclearance but noted there was little precedent. It s possible. It s our belief that you d have to have multiple instances of discriminatory purpose,  he said. ",politics,"Apr 11, 2017",1

Obama says expects Taliban to continue strategy of violence under new leader,"ISE-SHIMA, Japan (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Thursday he expects the Taliban to continue a strategy of violence following the appointment of a hardline leader, adding that the United States aims to uphold Afghanistan’s fragile democratization and prevent its use as a base by Islamic State.   “This continues to be an organization that sees violence as a strategy for obtaining its goals and moving its agenda forward in Afghanistan,” said Obama, told reporters during a Group of Seven summit at Ise-Shima in central Japan. “In the short-term, we anticipate that the Taliban will continue to pursue an agenda of violence and blowing up innocent people.”  “Our goal right now is to make sure (Afghanistan’s) constitution and democratic process is upheld (and) maintain the counter-terrorism platforms that we need in the region so that al Qaeda and now ISIL are not able to take root and use it as a base to attack us in the United States,” he said, using an acronym for Islamic State. The selection of cleric Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada as the new Taliban chief on Wednesday all but dashes Obama’s hopes for opening peace talks before he leaves office, one of his top foreign policy goals, current and former U.S. defense and intelligence officials said. Akhundzada, a conservative Islamic scholar from the Taliban’s stronghold in southern Afghanistan, succeeded Mullah Akhtar Mansour four days after he was killed in a U.S. drone strike.  Some U.S. officials had expressed hope that Mansour’s death would eliminate an obstacle to peace negotiations between the Taliban and the government of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.

"In Pakistan, North Korean diplomat's alcohol stash raises bootlegging suspicions"," ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Neighbors say when three men kicked down the doors and burgled the home of a North Korean diplomat in Islamabad last month, it took them more than three hours to lug out their booty: thousands of bottles of Scotch whisky, beer and French wine.  The robbers came prepared. Police and witnesses said they brought three cars and a small truck to plunder Hyon Ki Yong s trove of alcoholic drinks, which is worth more than $150,000 on the black market in a country where it is illegal for Muslims to consume alcohol.  The police, who recovered much of the stash soon after the Oct. 3 burglary, say that the three robbers were police officers and have issued arrest warrants for them and for a member of a well-known bootlegging family. They have also arrested Hyon s housekeeper.  Senior police and customs officials say the discovery of such a large amount of liquor has led them to conclude that some North Korean diplomats are involved in selling alcohol either to make money for themselves or to provide funds for the cash-starved regime in Pyongyang.  The North Korean government is facing increasingly tough United Nations-backed economic sanctions because of its nuclear weapons and missile development programs.   This North Korean was involved in liquor selling,  said a senior police official in Islamabad who is familiar with the investigation, in reference to Hyon.  The officer said North Korean diplomats in Pakistan had been doing this for years, though he didn t provide direct evidence of such sales.  Reuters could not independently verify that Hyon had been selling alcohol.  A diplomat from the North Korean embassy declined to comment on Hyon s case, or the wider allegations about alcohol sales.   It has been discussed between the embassy and MOFA (Pakistan s ministry of foreign affairs),  said the diplomat, who put the phone down before identifying himself. He did not respond to subsequent calls.  Reuters was unable to reach Hyon for comment.  The investigating police officer, Ishtiaq Hussain, said that the housekeeper, Boota Masih, had  confessed  to his role in the crime and had provided all the details.  Masih is in custody and he could not be reached for comment. Reuters couldn t determine if he has a lawyer.  One of the officers being sought by police, Malik Asif, told Reuters when contacted by phone that he denies being involved in the burglary. He said he is currently in hiding.    He said he had no doubt that North Koreans were involved in the alcohol smuggling business.   They have been doing this business for a long time,  he added.       Some foreign diplomats in Islamabad have long-held suspicions that North Korean diplomats in Pakistan are involved in bootlegging.  They say they believe Pakistan has turned a blind eye to bootlegging by North Koreans, perhaps out of courtesy to the historic ties between the two countries. Abdul Qadeer Khan, the Pakistani scientist lionized as the father of Pakistan s atomic bomb, in 2004 said he had sold nuclear secrets to North Korea.  Pakistan denies being lax in policing such behavior by North Korean diplomats.  No such activity has ever been, or shall ever be tolerated,  foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Faisal told Reuters.  When asked about this particular case, Faisal said:  Pakistan is actively investigating the case and any indiscretion, if proven, will be punished as per national and international laws.   Pakistan has also always denied helping North Korea with its nuclear program.  This summer, the U.S. embassy in Islamabad along with South Korean and Japanese counterparts lodged a complaint with Pakistan s Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the size of the North Korean mission in Pakistan, because they wanted to reduce its ability to raise funds for Pyongyang by reselling imported alcohol, according to diplomatic sources in Islamabad and Seoul.  The Japanese and South Koreans had been making such requests for more than a year, according to a source in Seoul. A Japanese foreign ministry source has denied knowledge of the demarche.  The source in Seoul estimates North Korea has 12-14 diplomats in Pakistan, split between Islamabad and Karachi, prompting some diplomats to wonder why Pyongyang needs so many representatives when   according to Pakistan central bank data - its official trade with Pakistan has ceased since August 2016.  Washington has been tightening the diplomatic and economic noose around North Korea, seeking to cut its foreign sources of funding amid fears the world s most isolated regime is on the cusp of developing intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads to American shores.  The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan declined to comment.  Japan s foreign ministry declined to comment.  The South Korean foreign ministry said:  Our government is closely monitoring any movement concerning illegal activities of North Korea but we cannot officially confirm this case.   Pakistan s foreign ministry didn t respond to questions about the pressure it faced from other nations over the size of North Korea s mission.  When Hyon discovered the robbery on Oct. 4 after returning to Islamabad from a trip to China,  the diplomat rushed to the nearby police station to report the crime.   He was angry and upset,  said Hussain, the police officer who interviewed Hyon in Islamabad s Kohsar police station.  And very worried.   Hyon told the police the robbers had fled with 1,200 bottles of Johnnie Walker Black Label whisky, 200 cases of wine, 60 cartons of beer, dozens of bottles of tequila, two diamonds and $3,000 in cash, according to a police document reviewed by Reuters. On the black market, the whisky alone is worth $80 per bottle, or a total $96,000.  Hyon and the North Korean embassy told police the alcohol was imported legally and presented documents to back up its case. Police declined to make the documents available.  A week after the robbery, North Korea s ambassador to Pakistan met the foreign ministry s chief of protocol and requested Hyon s missing items be returned, according to a Pakistani foreign ministry document seen by Reuters.  It is unclear whether Hyon, who would have diplomatic immunity, is himself under investigation.  Documents reviewed by Reuters showing four separate alcohol import orders by North Korea s embassy between March-December 2016 paint a picture of a mission importing alcoholic drinks that would be far above any reasonable personal needs of its diplomats.  During the nine-month period, the embassy imported 10,542 bottles of French Bordeaux wine through Truebell, a United Arab Emirates-based company. The four orders, billed by Truebell at $72,867, also included a total of 17,322 cans of Heineken and Carlsberg beer, as well as 646 bottles of champagne.  A person who answered the phone on Truebell s Sharjah, UAE number told Reuters that the company no longer has any dealing with North Korea, but did not elaborate, and would not answer any more questions.       Alcohol is a sensitive issue in Pakistan.  Muslims, by law, are not allowed to consume alcohol but many among the Westernized elite drink.  Non-Muslims such as Christians, Hindus and Sikhs, accounting for about 3 percent of the population between them, are allowed to drink alcohol but obtaining high-quality imported liquor and wine is almost impossible through legal means.  This has spawned a lucrative black market. Alcohol is smuggled across borders and through sea ports, while several diplomats from poorer countries told Reuters they had been offered thousands of dollars by bootleggers to buy their quarterly  alcohol quotas.    I ve been approached five times, usually at diplomatic receptions,  said one non-Western diplomat.  Under Pakistan s rules, Hyon, who has the first secretary rank at the North Korean embassy, would every three months be allowed to import a consignment of alcohol. Under one of the allowed formulas that would mean 120 liters of various spirits, 18 liters of wine and 240 liters of beer   only a fraction of the amount he reported missing.

Mike Pompeo leads the Deep State crusade to destroy Assange and Wikileaks.Pompeo s comments come nine months after WikiLeaks began releasing Vault7, a massive trove of classified CIA documents purportedly detailing the agency s hacking capabilities. The documents include reports of the agency s arsenal of malware and tech exploits, as well as its methods of infiltrating smartphones, TVs and laptops.The CIA is believed to have lost control of this arsenal before WikiLeaks obtained it. The hacking capabilities were doing the rounds among government hackers, one of whom provided WikiLeaks with the collection, the whistleblowing site explained. According to WikiLeaks, the Vault7 source wanted to  initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons. Some of the biggest revelations in Vault7 were the CIA s ability to mask its hacking exploits to make them appear to be the work of other countries, namely Russia, China and Iran.

Croatia and Slovenia fail to move forward in talks on border dispute,"ZAGREB (Reuters) - Croatia and Slovenia failed to reach a compromise solution for their border dispute in talks on Tuesday, with Slovenia gearing up to implement an international court ruling which Croatia dismisses as invalid.  The Permanent Court of Arbitration in June ruled that most of the Piran Bay area shared between the two neighbors was Slovenia s territorial waters, and that Slovenia should have a sea corridor through Croatian waters to international waters. The Hague-based court s six-month deadline for the states to implement the ruling expires on Dec. 29. Croatia rejects the  ruling, saying it withdrew from the process in 2015 because of Slovenia s violation of the arbitration procedure.  We intend to implement the ruling and expect Croatia to do the same,  Slovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar said at a news conference following talks in Zagreb on Tuesday with his Croatian counterpart Andrej Plenkovic.  Slovenia will start the implementation where it can do it alone, and it will seek dialogue and cooperation from Croatia where it cannot act alone.  Plenkovic said the ruling was not obligatory for Croatia, which had withdrawn from the arbitration process after a leaked tape showed that a Slovenian judge on the arbitration panel had improperly exchanged confidential information with the Ljubljana government. The court acknowledged the arbitration violation but concluded that it was not serious enough to halt the case.   The issue of borders is an open issue for Croatia,  Plenkovic said, adding that Croatia had proposed to Slovenia a legal framework for new talks on the borders. Cerar dismissed the idea, saying the arbitration ruling was final for Slovenia. Plenkovic warned against  unilateral acts that could cause incidents on the borders .      The two countries have been arguing over their sea and land borders since both declared independence from former Yugoslavia in 1991 as it disintegrated and slid into war. The dispute held up Croatian accession to the EU for many years. Only after both parties agreed to arbitration was Zagreb granted entry to the bloc in 2013. The court ruled that Slovenia should have most of the Piran Bay area recognized as its territorial waters.  In addition, the tribunal established a 2.5 nautical mile-wide and some 10 nautical mile-long corridor through Croatian waters to give Slovenia much-coveted direct access to international waters.

 Donald Trump Tried To Manipulate Stock Market Against One American Company; It Worked For A Few Hours,"Donald Trump hates Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, the world s number one online retailer. Trump doesn t hate Bezos because he received a package late or even because (as he claims) Amazon is responsible for a lot of brick and mortar stores closing down. Trump hates Bezos because the Amazon boss also owns the Washington Post, a newspaper that has been relentlessly following the Trump/Russia story.On Wednesday, Trump lashed out at Bezos via Twitter, causing Amazon stocks to significantly dip, before rebounding.Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers.

South Korea braces for possible new missile test to mark North's founding day,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea braced for a possible further missile test by North Korea as it marked its founding anniversary on Saturday, just days after its sixth and largest nuclear test rattled global financial markets and further escalated tensions in the region.  Throughout the week, South Korean officials have warned the North could launch another intercontinental ballistic missile, in defiance of U.N. sanctions and amid an escalating standoff with the United States. Pyongyang marks its founding anniversary each year with a big display of pageantry and military hardware. Last year, North Korea conducted its fifth nuclear test on the Sept. 9 anniversary. Tension on the Korean peninsula has escalated as North Korea s young leader, Kim Jong Un, has stepped up the development of weapons, testing a string of missiles this year, including one flying over Japan, and conducting its sixth nuclear test on Sunday. Experts believe the isolated regime is close to its goal of developing a powerful nuclear weapon capable of reaching the United States, something U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to prevent. Celebrating its founding anniversary, a front-page editorial of the Saturday edition of North Korea s official Rodong Sinmun said the country should make  more high-tech Juche weapons to continuously bring about big historical events such as a miraculous victory of July 28. . The July date refers to the intercontinental ballistic missile test.  Juche is North Korea s homegrown ideology of self-reliance that is a mix of Marxism and extreme nationalism preached by state founder Kim Il Sung, the current leader s grandfather.      South Korean nuclear experts, checking for contamination, said on Friday they had found minute traces of radioactive xenon gas but that it was too early to link it to Sunday s explosion. The Nuclear Safety and Security Commission (NSSC) said it had been conducting tests on land, air and water samples since shortly after the North Korean nuclear test on Sunday. Xenon is a naturally occurring, colourless gas that is used in manufacturing of some sorts of lights. But the NSSC said it had detected xenon-133, a radioactive isotope that does not occur naturally and which has in the past been linked to North Korea s nuclear tests. There was no chance the xenon  will have an impact on South Korea s territory or population , the agency said. Trump has repeatedly said all options are on the table in dealing with North Korea and on Thursday said he would prefer not to use military action, but if he did, it would be a  very sad day  for North Korea.  Military action would certainly be an option. Is it inevitable? Nothing is inevitable,  Trump told reporters.  If we do use it on North Korea, it will be a very sad day for North Korea.  Even as Trump has insisted that now is not the time to talk, senior members of his administration have made clear that the door to a diplomatic solution is open, especially given the U.S. assessment that any pre-emptive strike would unleash massive North Korean retaliation. North Korea says it needs its weapons to protect itself from U.S. aggression and regularly threatens to destroy the United States.  South Korea and the United States are technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty. The USS Ronald Reagan, a nuclear-powered carrier, left its home port in Japan for a routine autumn patrol of the Western Pacific, a Navy spokeswoman said. That area included waters between Japan and the Korean peninsula, she added, without giving any further details.  The Ronald Reagan was out on routine patrol from May until August, and was sent to the Sea of Japan with the another carrier, the USS Carl Vinson, to take part in drills with Japan s Self Defense Forces as well as the South Korean military.  North Korea vehemently objects to military exercises on or near the peninsula, and China and Russia have suggested the United States and South Korea halt their exercises to lower tension. While Trump talked tough on North Korea, China agreed on Thursday that the United Nations should take more action against it, but it also pushed for dialogue. The U.N. Security Council is expected to vote on a new set of sanctions soon. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that it was too early to draw conclusions about the final form of the U.N. resolution, Russia s Interfax news agency quoted Lavrov as saying at a news conference on Friday. The United States on Friday told the U.N. Security Council that it intends to call a meeting on Monday to vote on a draft resolution establishing additional sanctions on North Korea for its missile and nuclear program, the U.S. Mission to the United Nations said in a statement. U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said last Monday that she intended to call for a vote on Sept. 11 and then the United States circulated a draft resolution to the 15-member council on Wednesday. The United States wants the Security Council to impose an oil embargo on North Korea, ban its exports of textiles and the hiring of North Korean laborers abroad, and to subject Kim Jong Un to an asset freeze and travel ban, according to a draft resolution seen by Reuters on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear how North Korean allies China and Russia would vote, but a senior U.S. official on Friday night expressed scepticism that either nation would accept anything more stringent than a ban on imports of North Korean textiles. Chinese officials have privately expressed fears that imposing an oil embargo could risk triggering massive instability in its neighbor.  North Korea offered fresh vitriol against the pending sanctions, specifically targeting Haley, who this week accused Kim of  begging for war .  There is nothing more foolish than thinking we, a strong nuclear state, will endure this evil pressure aimed at overthrowing our state,  the North s official news agency said in a commentary.  Even if Nikki Haley is blind, she must use her mouth correctly. The United States administration will pay for not being able to control the mouth of their U.N. representative.  China is by far North Korea s biggest trading partner, accounting for 92 percent of two-way trade last year. It also provides hundreds of thousands of tonnes of oil and fuel to the impoverished regime.   China s economic influence has been felt by South Korea as well. The two countries have been at loggerheads over South Korea s decision to deploy a U.S. anti-missile system, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, which has a powerful radar that can probe deep into China. Shares in South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor (005380.KS) and key suppliers slid on Friday on worries over its position in China after highly critical Chinese state newspaper comments. The military section of China s Global Times newspaper on Thursday referred to THAAD as  a malignant tumor . ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",0
House Republicans float controversial budget plan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Republicans on Tuesday insisted they will proceed with a fiscal 2017 budget plan despite a flat-out rejection from their party’s fiscal hawks that poses an important test of Speaker Paul Ryan’s leadership.  The $3.9 trillion proposal, which the House Budget Committee hopes to embrace formally on Wednesday for an eventual floor vote, would provide Ryan with a first step in his political goal of uniting the Republican Party behind a detailed policy plan ahead of November’s presidential and congressional elections. The plan aims to achieve a balanced budget within a decade.  “I promise in this speakership that we’re not going to have a top-down, cram-it-down-people’s-throat kind of leadership,” Ryan told reporters.  “We’re going to make decisions as a team. We’re going to push power out to the members, and we’re going to make a team decision on this issue,” he added.    But the House Freedom Caucus, which includes dozens of outspoken conservatives who dethroned Ryan’s predecessor John Boehner, has been complaining for months about a $1.07 trillion ceiling for discretionary spending that was enacted into law last November. It says the cap should be $30 billion lower and has warned leaders of its opposition.  Several Freedom Caucus members sit on the House budget panel, including Representative Dave Brat, a Virginia Republican who described the group’s position as mainstream: “We’re where the American people want us to be.” Brat said he was leaning toward voting against the proposal in a committee work-session set for Wednesday. Stubborn opposition among Freedom Caucus members, despite weeks of behind-the-scene talks among House Republicans, call into question the ability of party leaders to muster the 218 votes needed to pass the budget without help from the chamber’s 188 Democrats. Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the panel’s top Democrat, slammed the Republican proposal as a plan that would hurt the middle class and harm the Medicare healthcare program for the elderly and disabled. Democratic attacks and fiscal hawk opposition are leading some Republicans to call for a seldom-used “Queen of the Hill” strategy that would allow members to consider different proposals but deem the one with the most votes as having passed the chamber. The budget blueprint is non-binding, meaning it is not subject to President Barack Obama’s approval. But it provides guidance to appropriators as they write bills to fund an array of government programs beginning Oct. 1, the start of the next fiscal year.  ",politicsNews,"March 15, 2016 ",0

Mexico presidential hopeful hemmed in by ruling party legacy,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mired in allegations of corruption, Mexico s ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has thrown its weight behind an untainted outsider in a bid to clean up its image and hang on to the presidency in elections next July. But having never been a member of the party, former finance minister and PRI presidential hopeful Jose Antonio Meade faces a delicate balancing act persuading undecided voters he will cut out graft without alienating the grassroots support he needs to win. It is proving to be a tough job. The awkward symbiosis limits Meade s ability to play to the strengths that PRI grandees hope will overcome the accusations of embezzlement, fraud and vote buying that have plagued the party under President Enrique Pena Nieto. Reliant on the PRI machinery to deliver votes, Meade must wrap himself in the party banner, while distancing his campaign from the failures of the outgoing government he also represents.  He s between a rock and a hard place,  said Andres Rozental, a former deputy Mexican foreign minister. Pena Nieto is constitutionally barred from re-election, and the centrist PRI will not formally elect its candidate until Feb. 18. However, the party has lined up behind Meade, who held various cabinet posts across two opposing administrations before announcing his run late last month. Meade, a technocrat with a sharp command of the minutiae of the economy, launched his campaign for the PRI candidacy in a straw sombrero festooned with red and green streamers in the poor southern town of San Juan Chamula on Dec. 14. Meade acknowledged Pena Nieto in his speech, which called for a  secure and just Mexico.  But he did not detail policies or directly address corruption. Like the president, he has said graft must be attacked by strengthening institutions. In subsequent outings to rally the PRI faithful, he has continued to frame his vision in general terms - prompting expressions of dismay by some of his supporters.  It s a typical PRI campaign,  said one pro-Meade lawmaker, shaking his head, and speaking on condition of anonymity. Polls show Meade has plenty of work to do. A survey by polling firm Parametria published on Dec. 19 put him 11 percentage points behind leftist front-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor who has spent years railing against corruption and inequality. Another survey, by pollster Mitofsky, showed this month that 57.4 percent of voters reject the PRI, up nearly seven points from October, and 17 points more than any other party. In December 2011, the same point in the previous campaign, the PRI had a lead of about 17 points and only one in five voters rejected the party, according to Mitofsky data. Serving in the cabinet for almost seven years running, Meade has sold himself as irreproachably honest and the safest pair of hands for the economy, painting Lopez Obrador and conservative rival Ricardo Anaya as risky bets for Mexico s stability. However, his time in government has left the 48-year-old with a problematic legacy to defend. Gang violence has worsened in the past couple of years, with murders hitting a record high in 2017. [L1N1ON0EQ] Meanwhile the economy is growing at barely 2 percent annually, less than half the rate the government first targeted, inflation is near a 16-year high and the peso has depreciated by more than 34 percent against the dollar under Pena Nieto. A study by the Pew Research Center in September identified crime and corruption as the top concerns for Mexicans. As standard-bearer for an unpopular government, Meade has to present more compelling solutions to those problems than his rivals, said one senior official backing him.   It was one of this government s biggest mistakes not to see the damage that corruption could do to its reputation,  said the official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said he believed Meade s policies could become clearer once he is formally invested as PRI candidate. Meade s campaign did not reply to requests for comment. Another government official closely following the campaign said that while Meade could recognize failings in the PRI, he could not be expected to attack the party.  You can t take the PRI s core vote for granted,  the official said. With some PRI governors, lawmakers and Pena Nieto facing allegations of corruption, it could be  suicidal  for Meade to  push a tough line on graft, said Juan Pardinas, general director of the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, a think tank.  How could you (take) a strong stance against corruption, being the PRI candidate?,  he asked.  It s like (taking) a strong stance against racism at a Ku Klux Klan rally.

" Republican Goes Rogue, Blames Trump For Baseball Game Attack On GOP (VIDEO)","There have been many reactions to the horrific shooting at a Republican baseball game this week, but the one that was just given by Congressman Mark Sanford (R-SC) is one of the most shocking.While many Republicans have been quick to blame Democrats and Liberals for the shooter s actions, Sanford went on Morning Joe today to point the finger at America s president, Donald Trump. Sounding like a Republican who might actually have a tiny grip on reality, Sanford argued that Trump helped create a toxic political environment, which may have motivated yesterday s attack. Sanford said: I think we have to watch out as a society because, if we don t watch out, civility is indeed a part of civilized government and an open political system. If you let these forces play out, I think we end up at a very, very bad spot. I think what happened yesterday was symptomatic of it. Sanford then turned his focus on Trump, stating that he is part of the reason America has become so deeply divided, and his rhetoric has undoubtedly had an effect on the country. Sanford didn t mince his words when he said: I would argue that the president is at least in partially   not totally   but partially to blame for demons that have been unleashed. The fact that you have the top guy saying I wish I can hit you in the face. Why don t you and I ll pay your legal fees. That s bizarre. We ought to call it as such. What I ve said back home, some of these people have been frankly weird and different in a town hall meeting. I say what is going on. They ll say look, if the guy at the top can say anything to anybody at any time, why can t I? I think we all need to look for ways to learn from what happened yesterday and to say, wait a minute, this is a pause moment. What might I do a little differently in the way I reached out to other members. Finally, a Republican who has the guts to point out just how insane and inappropriate Trump s behavior is, and to acknowledge that there are consequences to having a POTUS who is this unhinged.

 Republican Greg Abbott Picks Supporting Israel Over Obama – Plans With Bibi To Antagonize Iran,"Governor Greg Abbott of Texas recently traveled to Israel to kiss the ring of Bibi Netanyahu. While there, he pledged that he will do what he can as Texas  leader to obey Israel s desires and begin working on new ways to re-antagonize Iran.Abbott, like most Republicans, owes his true loyalty to Netanyahu s craving for discord instead of America s effort at peace and cooperation. Abbott pledged to craft laws in Texas to curb the flow of any public funds to Iran. He seeks to accomplish this by banning any state-level investments in Iran or by banning Texas government from doing business with any company that does business in Iran. The second part of that is particularly hypocritical. Republicans have always used terms like  free trade  and the concept of little to no government regulation of business to attack liberals. However, when  free trade  conflicts with the desires of Benjamin Netanyahu   a leader of a foreign nation   there suddenly isn t enough regulation that can be enacted.When asked for an example of how many Texan public dollars flow to Iran, Governor Abbott s office was unable to provide any figures. Without some real data, the impact of Abbott s new laws will be unproven at best, and he would likely have to spend more state money to audit companies to make that determination. Fiscal conservatism at its best Governor Abbott will obviously not be able to single-handedly bring Iran to its knees over new state-level  sanctions,  but the politics on this are clear. Republicans still want to do everything they can to sabotage what is otherwise an incredibly successful and historic win for President Obama on his diplomatic victory with Iran. Being able to show their undying loyalty to a foreign leader in the process is just a nice bonus.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 18, 2016",1
 Karma’s Latest Victim: Birthers Drag Ted Cruz To Court To Challenge His Eligibility For Presidency,"They say karma s a bi*ch, and it continues to be for the Republicans. First, it was Rubio who was dragged off to court by the birthers who claim that he s not eligible to be president. Now, birthers have gone after Ted Cruz in Texas.A Texas attorney has filed suit in federal district court saying that Cruz can t be president because he s not a  natural born citizen  of the United States. Cruz was born in Canada. One of the few requirements to become president in the U.S. Constitution is to be a  natural born citizen  of the United States. Attorney Newton B. Schwartz, Sr.. in a 28 page complaint, is demanding that the U.S. Supreme Court address the issue since  natural born  has never been defined. Schwartz said:  This 229-year question has never been pled, presented to or finally decided by or resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court. Only the U.S. Supreme Court can finally decide, determine judicially and settle this issue now. Cruz, who ironically is an anti-immigration hawk, believes there is no issue. During Thursday s debate, Cruz went on the defensive against Trump, who s been at the forefront of questioning Cruz s eligibility. Cruz said:  There s nothing to this birther issue. Since September, the Constitution hasn t changed. But the poll numbers have. I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa. But the facts and the law are really clear. Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen abroad is a natural born citizen. Not so simple says respected constitutional lawyer Mary Brigid McManamon at Widener University s Delaware Law School: The Constitution provides that  No person except a natural born Citizen . . . shall be eligible to the Office of President.  The concept of  natural born  comes from common law, and it is that law the Supreme Court has said we must turn to for the concept s definition. On this subject, common law is clear and unambiguous. The 18th-century English jurist William Blackstone, the preeminent authority on it, declared natural-born citizens are  such as are born within the dominions of the crown of England  while aliens are  such as are born out of it.  The key to this division is the assumption of allegiance to one s country of birth. The Americans who drafted the Constitution adopted this principle for the United States. James Madison, known as the  father of the Constitution,  stated,  It is an established maxim that birth is a criterion of allegiance. . . . [And] place is the most certain criterion; it is what applies in the United States.' Based on this interpretation, Cruz is disqualified. The irony in all this is that Cruz supports denying citizenship to children born in the United States, but whose parents are not US citizens.Is it karma that the Republicans are now reeling from the prospect of two of their leading candidates being ineligible for the presidency?  Throughout President Obama s seven years in the White House, many Republicans have floated the idea that he was not born in the United States. In fact, they propagated the idea so much that 53% of Republicans believe this nonsense today.The birther movement, which consists of many Republicans, has attacked and tried to discredit the president for years. Now, that same movement is after the very same institution, the Republican Party, that propagated it in the first place.Featured image via Nation of Change",News,"January 15, 2016",1
 GOP Rep. Says People Could Use Bales Of Marijuana To Smuggle Nukes Into The Country (VIDEO),"Republicans have been coming up with some pretty ridiculous reasons for why they think we need to ban Muslims and build that stupid wall. Donald Trump and his administration have taken to making up fake terrorist attacks, which is sad enough. But now, we apparently have to worry about people smuggling nuclear weapons into our country   hidden inside bales of marijuana, no less.Rep. Trent Franks did an interview with CNN on Wednesday and was trying to explain why we need Trump s border wall. Sadly, he was being completely serious when he made this ridiculous assertion. We sometimes used to make the point that if someone wanted to smuggle a dangerous weapon into America, even a nuclear weapon, how would they do it?  he said.  The suggestion is, maybe we ll hide it in a bale of marijuana. There are national security implications here for a porous border. As a group of nations, we need to understand that America is the world s flagship of freedom. If we don t have a secure border, that hurts everyone in the long run. As absurd as this idea is, this isn t the first time it has been suggested that someone could sneak in a nuclear weapon by stuffing it inside bales of pot. Earlier this month, Rep. Brad Sherman made the comment that  missile defense is OK politically, but remember you can smuggle a nuclear weapon inside a bale of marijuana. As David Kay of the International Atomic Energy Agency explains, the scenario might not be as ridiculous as it sounds on the surface. I ve often said, my preferred method for delivering a nuclear device is, I would hide it in a bale of marijuana, contract it out to the drug lords and move it,  he said. Marijuana is a good shielder actually for radiation. The drug lords have a superb record for delivery. They re not Fed Ex, but they re awfully close to it. And contract it out and get it across the border. Even Frank Ciluffo, the director of George Washington University s Homeland Security Policy Institute, floated the idea back in 2014. If you want to smuggle in a tactical nuclear weapon, just put it in a bale of marijuana,  Ciluffo said.  Because we re not doing that well in terms of some of our drug enforcement. Luckily, we won t have to worry about any of this because Trump is going to build his massive wall and no bad people will ever be able to get into our country again!You can watch Frank s CNN interview, here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"February 22, 2017",1

Muslims in the United States joined those around the world during the holy month of Ramadan to focus on acts of faith and charity,  they said.

France would not recognize unilateral Catalan declaration: minister,"PARIS (Reuters) - France will not recognize Catalonia if the Spanish region unilaterally declares independence, European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau said on Monday.  If there were to be a declaration of independence, it would be unilateral, and it would not be recognized,  Loiseau said on CNews television. Catalonia, which has its own language and culture and is led by a pro-independence regional government, held a referendum on Oct. 1 over secession in defiance of Spain s constitutional court, which had declared the vote illegal.      Catalonia cannot be defined by the vote organized by the independence movement just over a week ago,  the French junior minister said.  This crisis needs to be resolved through dialogue at all levels of Spanish politics.  A hasty decision to recognize independence following such a unilateral declaration would amount to fleeing France s responsibilities, Loiseau added.  If independence were to be recognized - which is not something that s being discussed - the most immediate consequence would be that (Catalonia) automatically left the European Union.

U.N. warns of new Syrian refugee wave to Europe if aid dries up,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Syrian refugees could again seek to reach Europe in droves if aid programs are not sustained in five neighboring countries hosting the bulk of them, the United Nations said on Tuesday. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was giving details of the $4.4 billion appeal to support 5.3 million Syrian refugees in surrounding countries as well as to host communities in Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan and Egypt that have taken them in. The agency, which has received only 53 percent of its $4.63 billion appeal for 2017, needs international support, Amin Awad, director of UNHCR s Middle East and North Africa bureau, told a news briefing. He listed  many reasons , including:  The vast number of refugees that we have in the region, the geopolitical status of that region, the risk that a population of 5.3 million people can bring to an area, a small region already volatile as it is, if there is no assistance.  We had the experience of 2015, we don t want to repeat that,  he said. The lack of funding led to an acute shortage of services that year, when one million refugees fled to Europe, he added. About half were Syrians, UNHCR figures show. An EU-Turkey deal has largely halted the flow, but a UNHCR funding shortfall has led to fresh cutbacks in vital programs providing food, health care, education and shelter to Syrian refugees, Awad said.  That means we re not able to provide stoves, we are not able to deliver kerosene, we are not able to deliver enough thermal blankets, we are not able to winterise tents, we are not able to drain water and snow from camps, we are not able to do engineering work to insulate some of the buildings. People are sitting in cold, open buildings,  he said. Turkey currently hosts 3.3 million Syrian refugees, the largest number, followed by Lebanon with one million.  These are the biggest donors, these are the real donors. They provided space, international protection,  Awad said.   Now the material assistance is left to the donors and international community... And that s not coming through. So we have to be prepared for consequences,  he said. Awad, asked about countries in the region closing their borders to Syrian refugees, replied:  Borders are managed, in some instance are closed.  Host countries have cited concerns over security, economic crises, and xenophobia, but Syrians continue to arrive, he said.  Lebanon is still accepting vulnerable cases, medical cases, so is Turkey,  Awad said. There have been cases of  refoulement , returning refugees to places where they could face war or persecution, in violation of law, he said.  We are seeing expulsion, we are seeing people sent back.  UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards declined to provide specifics on Syrian refugees being expelled. ",worldnews,"December 12, 2017 ",0
"After political storm, Indonesia president faces economic clouds","JAKARTA (Reuters) - During the first months of this year, President Joko Widodo was an embattled leader grappling with Indonesia s most serious political and religious tensions in two decades. Now, he has come through the storm looking stronger than ever. His popularity is near record highs and, thanks to deft maneuvers against foes trying to exploit a blasphemy case against one of his allies, Widodo has stamped his authority on the ruling coalition, parliament and the security forces. The quietly spoken former furniture salesman may have proved his political mettle, but his next challenge is an economy that refuses to respond to conventional policies to fire up growth. That could dent his re-election chances in 2019, especially with a budget that won t stretch to lavish government spending. Senior government officials worry that Widodo has been distracted by the battles with political opponents and taken his eye off the economy.  We are suffering from bad policy right now ... if we don t fix it or we don t regain the initiative I could easily see GDP growth going down, and is that a risk you want to take?  said one senior government official, who asked not to be identified. According to a June survey, nearly 60 percent of people polled were satisfied with Widodo s performance, almost an all-time high. But the poll also showed high expectations that he would deliver on promises to revive the lackluster economy.  If he doesn t perform on the economy, that would give ammunition to the opposition to challenge Jokowi in 2019,  said Djayadi Hanan of the Saiful Mujani Research Center, a Jakarta-based pollster, using the president s nickname. Indonesia s GDP growth has shambled at around 5 percent for the past two years, too low to lift the country out of the middle-income trap, largely because domestic consumption - once the engine of the economy - and bank lending have been sluggish. An unexpected cut in interest rates last month highlighted the struggle to lift growth despite government initiatives, including a tax amnesty program, an infrastructure drive, and a series of regulatory tweaks designed to make business easier. The government has little fiscal room to breathe life into the economy: the budget deficit is already close to a legally mandated ceiling of 3 percent of GDP and parliament could impeach Widodo if he allowed the deficit to run past that limit. David Sumual, chief economist at Indonesia s Bank Central Asia, said a hike in electricity tariffs and slow disbursement of subsidies to farmers have weakened the purchasing power of middle- to lower-income households. Meanwhile, higher-income groups are worried that the government is pushing for aggressive tax reform that will leave them less well off.  The problem now is confidence in the prospect of the economy. People don t want to spend,  Sumual said. In his state-of-the-nation address last month, Widodo pledged to tackle income inequality by cutting red tape and making land acquisition easier to accelerate infrastructure projects. And last week he urged his cabinet to focus on attracting investment to boost growth and create jobs. But two officials who spoke to Reuters said they worried he was not matching his rhetoric with bold steps that need to be taken now for growth to be marching higher next year, when campaigning for the 2019 presidential election will begin. On the to-do list remains finding a way to rein in the overbearing dominance of state-owned enterprises on the economy, which was singled out by the World Bank in July as something preventing private funds flowing in. In addition, there is a need to speed up efforts to tackle a tortuous regulatory and licensing regime to lift investment, an area where Widodo said last week, during the launch of a new policy package,  there s so much we have to improve, so much to fix . Just months ago, Widodo appeared to be fighting for his political survival as political opponents joined forces with radical Islamist groups to foment popular fury over alleged blasphemous comments made by Widodo s ally Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, the former Christian governor of Jakarta. Amid massive protests in central Jakarta, there were rumors of treason plots and even a military takeover.  Beating the drum of Indonesia s  unity in diversity  motto, Widodo embarked on a frenzy of public appearances at military barracks, the homes of both political rivals and allies, and at moderate Islamic boarding schools - all aimed at projecting an image of unity and control.  He has been busy in the past six to eight months fighting back against destabilizing forces,  said Endy Bayuni, editor-in-chief of the most widely read English daily, the Jakarta Post.  He s showed that he is very much in control of the situation and has become even more mature as a politician.  Widodo s latest move to regain political authority took aim at hardline Islamist groups. By executive decree, he banned Hizb-ut Tahrir, a group that calls for Indonesia to be ruled by Islamic sharia law, saying its ambitions ran counter to the country s secular ideology. Such political dominance could provide Widodo with a false sense of security, the senior government official said.  The dark side of the story is ... the economy,  he said.  I think the biggest threat now, potentially   and it s the flip side of the incredibly strong political position he is in   would be complacency.  ",worldnews,"September 4, 2017 ",0

 W. Virginia Halloween Store Boasts Shockingly Racist Costume Display Featuring Pres. Obama (VIDEO),"West Virginia is solid Trump country. The argument has been made that the opioid crisis, along with the  forgotten  population of white working class voters, is the reason for that state being overwhelmingly Trump Nation. However, there is one element that cannot be ignored here: Those same white working class voters also feature a lot of racists who hate President Barack Obama, and the ultimate way to stick it to him was to put Donald Trump in the White House.Well, it seems that putting Trump in power wasn t enough for these people. Even though the orange fascist has been steadily shredding the country, degrading the office of the presidency, emboldening our adversaries and scaring the hell out of our allies for nigh on a year now, these people simply cannot resist the temptation to attack President Obama in ever more stunningly racist ways.

U.S. lawmakers question Mylan's Medicaid EpiPen rebates,"(Reuters) - Two key U.S. congressional committee members on Friday called for an investigation into whether Mylan NV, under fire for raising the price of its EpiPen device, overcharged the government’s low-income healthcare program for the allergy treatment. In a letter to the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Senator Ron Wyden and Representative Frank Pallone, both Democrats, seek clarification of whether EpiPen was classified as a generic, “non-innovator” drug, or a brand-name drug by the Medicaid program. Under current law, branded drugs, and generic drugs available from a single source, are required to pay a rebate amount of at least 23.1 percent of the average manufacturer price. Generic drugs are subject to a much lower 13 percent rebate. Mylan, in an emailed statement, said it has complied with all laws and regulations regarding Medicaid rebates, and intends to file with regulators, by next April as required under new guidelines, for EpiPen to be classified as a “non-innovator” product. The device jabs a dose of the drug epinephrine into the thigh to counter dangerous allergic reactions such as to peanuts, food allergies and bee stings.  Mylan, whose tax address is in the Netherlands but which has corporate headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, has raised the U.S. price of EpiPen from less than $100 when it acquired the product in 2007 to more than $600. Amid an outcry by parents, consumer groups and U.S. politicians, the company said on Monday it will soon launch the first generic version of the device for $300, half the list price of its branded product.  Wyden, ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, and Pallone, ranking member of the House Energy & Commerce Committee, said in the letter on Friday: “It has recently come to our attention that Mylan has classified EpiPen as a generic drug” under the Medicaid rebate program, even though it is considered a new drug by the Food and Drug Administration. Shares of Mylan, which fell 4.7 percent to close at $39.97 on Friday, have dropped 19 percent since mid-August. ",politicsNews,"September 2, 2016 ",0

Voice of triumph or doom: North Korean presenter back in limelight for nuclear test,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Wearing a pink Korean dress and flashing a wide smile, television presenter Ri Chun Hee delivered the news of Pyongyang s sixth nuclear test with her usual gusto. Using her trademark bombastic delivery, Ri announced on state television on Sunday the hydrogen bomb test was  a perfect success!  and a key step in  completing the state nuclear force.  The 74-year-old grandmother is considered a national hero who first took to the airwaves in 1971, leaving a career in acting for the broadcaster Korean Central Television (KCTV) Ri s dramatic flare set her apart from other announcers - whether she was angrily denouncing the West or boasting of the regime s achievements and the strength of its leaders.  She s the perfect person to voice North Korea s hard-line stance,  said Ahn Chan-il, a high-ranking North Korean defector who now lives in South Korea.      There is no one else who has that power in her voice as she does. It s just right for talking about nuclear weapons or missiles,  Ahn said. Ri, who usually wears a traditional Korean dress known as a hanbok, has also shown a softer side.  She famously wept on air when announcing North Korea s founder Kim Il Sung s death in 1994. When his son Kim Jong Il died in 2011, it was Ri - clad in black funeral clothes and her voice trembling - who delivered the news to North Koreans.   Despite officially retiring in 2012, Ri has been brought back for major announcements. Sunday s broadcast underscored her longevity at a time when current leader Kim Jong Un has purged some party and military officials from his father s era.  Outside North Korea, the  pink lady  is a familiar face of the regime during the latest tensions over Pyongyang s weapons programs.

 WATCH: Jimmy Kimmel Hilariously WRECKS Trump For Whining About ‘Hamilton’,"If Donald Trump doesn t want to be booed or lampooned over the next four years he should start acting presidential instead of like a big baby.Instead of putting on his big boy pants and accepting the reality that people are going to boo him and Mike Pence for the way they have treated others, Trump chose to lash out after hearing that Pence was booed by the audience at a performance of  Hamilton  on Broadway.But Trump focused his ire on the cast for reading a message to Pence at the end of the play.Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016Despite Trump s claims, the cast of  Hamilton  did not disrespect Mike Pence. They merely expressed their hope that he learned something by watching the play and the hope that he will be a vice-president for everyone. And even Mike Pence has twice said that he wasn t offended. So, Mike Pence wasn t offended and Donald Trump was,  Kimmel said.  Why do I feel like we re going to see a lot more of this dynamic? Who gets into a fight with a musical?  Kimmel continued.  How is it possible that Donald Trump can get along with Putin but not  Hamilton? Kimmel went on to say that if Trump really wants  Hamilton  to apologize he should apologize to the long list of people he insulted and offended over the last year and a half and proceeded to run that list on the screen.Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump cannot continue lashing out every time he he thinks someone is disrespecting him. We have freedom of speech in this country and our leaders are supposed to be busy running the nation instead of ordering people to be nice to them. The bottom line is that the level of disrespect towards Trump is nowhere near to how conservatives have treated President Obama for the last eight years. So Trump should stop being a total hypocrite, and if he can t do that he should step aside, tell the electors he can t do this job, and allow an adult like Hillary Clinton to do it.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"November 22, 2016",1
Militant threat hangs over Islamic State's former Libyan stronghold,"SIRTE, Libya (Reuters) - Nearly a year after Islamic State was driven from its Libyan stronghold Sirte, residents surveying their wrecked homes feel neglected and vulnerable, still afraid of the militant threat that has waned but not vanished. Though security in the Mediterranean coastal city has improved, residents remain wary of jihadists in the desert to the south who have stepped up their activity in recent months, setting up checkpoints and carrying out occasional attacks. In a country where fighting between rival forces frequently flares, Sirte is particularly exposed. It sits in the center of Libya s coastline on the dividing line between loose alliances aligned with rival governments in Tripoli and the east.  If the situation continues like this then Daesh (Islamic State) will come back, no doubt. There was a reason why they came. People were angry, felt sidelined,  said Ali Miftah, a civil servant and father of five.  Now we don t get any support from the government. Look at these ruins. We lost everything.  Last month, Islamic State gunmen staged a suicide attack in Misrata, the coastal city about 230 km (140 miles) to the northwest that led the campaign last year to expel the militants from Sirte. IS also has sleeper cells in other cities along Libya s western coast, security officials say, and there is concern foreign fighters seeking sanctuary after defeats in Syria and Iraq could once again exploit the country s security vacuum and link up with al Qaeda-linked militants in the desert south. Divisions among Libya s many armed factions and uncertainty over how long the forces from Misrata that drove Islamic State out will remain in Sirte are compounding residents  worries. In parts of the city, life is slowly returning to normal, though Islamic State s black logos are still visible on some shops and inhabitants struggle with cash shortages and failing public services, as they do elsewhere in Libya. But in areas that saw the heaviest fighting, families see little hope of rebuilding their homes. Sirte, the home city of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, was pounded by nearly 500 U.S. air strikes between August and December last year. In El Manar and Giza Bahriya, once among Sirte s best neighborhoods, houses looking onto the crystal blue Mediterranean are now crumpled piles of twisted metal and concrete, doors blasted from their metal frames.  A damaged primary school said to have once been attended by Gaddafi lies abandoned. Residents say skeletons among the rubble have been left to be tested to see if they belong to Islamic State fighters, or their captives. They are also scared to search their ruined homes because of the unexploded ordnance in the wreckage. Local forces man checkpoints on the outskirts of Sirte and carry out patrols to the south. But they say they lack the vehicles and weapons to pursue the jihadists, who have retreated into mobile desert camps. Instead, they rely on the U.S. air strikes that have killed dozens of suspected militants this year.  We contain the threat but we cannot chase them in their camps because we lack the right equipment like four-wheel cars needed to drive in the desert,  said Taher Hadeed, an official with the forces securing Sirte.  It won t be possible for Daesh to take back the city, but there is a risk of attacks.  The forces that led the campaign against Islamic State in Sirte last year are nominally loyal to the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli to the west - and Sirte now represents the eastern limit of their control. Beyond, forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar s Libyan National Army control oil terminals they seized during the campaign. But for now, the two sides do not coordinate, said Mohamed al-Ghasri, a military spokesman from Misrata. Residents and officials in Sirte say the threat cannot be dealt with without proper support from the state and professional security forces.  They are suffering from a lack of services and we don t see any real efforts or results on the ground at any level,  said Siddeeq Ismaiel, a municipal official. An estimated 2,500-3,000 homes need to be built so families forced to live in other parts of Sirte or Misrata can return.   This will never end if there is no government,  said Hamza Ali, a 34-year-old university employee, standing near his brother s ruined house.  It will stop maybe for two, three, four, five, six months, then you will hear an explosion somewhere if there is no official security, police.  ",worldnews,"November 10, 2017 ",0
Clinton rejects Mexico invitation after Trump's diplomatic ruckus,"(Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said on Monday she will not accept an invitation from Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto for a visit after rival Donald Trump created what she called a “diplomatic incident” in his foray there. In a written excerpt from an interview with ABC News that will air Tuesday morning, Clinton simply said “no” when asked if she would travel to Mexico before the election on Nov. 8, without elaborating further. Her campaign later confirmed her decision. “We understand and respect her decision to propose the time to hold a meeting,” said Mexican Foreign Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu in a tweet, adding that contact with Clinton’s campaign was ongoing. Pena Nieto extended invitations to both candidates last month, and Trump flew to Mexico City last Wednesday for a meeting that appeared to be friendly but later revealed deep tensions. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has been highly critical of Mexico, saying the country sends rapists and drug dealers to the United States. He has called for a wall to be built on the border that would be paid for by Mexico.  Trump said at a joint news conference with Pena Nieto that they did not discuss who would pay for the wall. Pena Nieto remained silent on the issue at the event, but said later on Twitter that he made it clear Mexico would not pay for the wall. “He came out saying one thing and the Mexican president contradicted him almost immediately,” Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, said in the ABC interview. “He didn’t raise it, so he did choke. He didn’t know how to even communicate effectively with a head of state. And I think that’s a pretty clear outcome from that trip,” she added.    ",politicsNews,"September 6, 2016 ",0
"Iran, EU and Russia defend nuclear deal after Trump threat","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Iran, U.S. allies in Europe and Russia on Friday defended the 2015 nuclear agreement with Tehran and said they would stick by it, after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to terminate the agreement. Trump said in a Washington speech that he would not certify that Iran is complying with its agreement with six world powers and the European Union, despite a determination by the U.N. s nuclear watchdog that Tehran is meeting the deal s terms. The Republican president threw the issue to the U.S. Congress, which has 60 days to decide whether to reinstate U.S. sanctions. He warned that if  we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.  Trump s actions appeared to leave the United States relatively isolated on the world stage. His hawkish new stance toward Iran, including steps against the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, received strong backing only from Israel and Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Iran will remain committed to the multinational deal as long as it serves the country s national interests. Trump s decision to decertify the deal will isolate the United States, as other signatories of the accord remained committed to it, Rouhani said in a live television address. The deal was not renegotiable, he said. The agreement, negotiated by Trump s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama, eased sanctions on Tehran in returns for strict limits on its nuclear program. Trump s stance put him at odds with key U.S. allies, including Britain, France and Germany who, along with Russia and China, negotiated the deal with Iran alongside the European Union. In Brussels, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said Washington could not unilaterally cancel the agreement.  We cannot afford as the international community to dismantle a nuclear agreement that is working,  said Mogherini, who chaired the final stages of the landmark talks.  This deal is not a bilateral agreement.  The international community, and the European Union with it, has clearly indicated that the deal is, and will continue to be, in place,  Mogherini told reporters in Brussels. The leaders of Britain, France and Germany issued a joint statement warning the United States against taking decisions that could harm the nuclear deal such as re-imposing sanctions. The three leaders also said they shared U.S. concerns over Iran s ballistic missile program and regional destabilizing activities and were ready to work with Washington to address those concerns. French President Emmanuel Macron s office said he had spoken with Rouhani by telephone and assured him of France s commitment to the deal, but that Tehran must strictly comply with it. Russia s foreign ministry said there was no place in international diplomacy for threatening and aggressive rhetoric, and said such methods were doomed to fail, in a statement issued after Trump s speech. The ministry said Trump s decision to de-certify the deal would not have a direct impact on implementation of the agreement but that it ran counter to its spirit. There was no immediate reaction from China, though Alexei Pushkov, a pro-Kremlin lawmaker in the upper house of the Russian parliament, said neither Moscow nor Beijing backed Trump s stance.  Russia of course does not support the U.S. position, nor does China. So Trump will be left in proud isolation in an attempt to improve his image among his own supporters,  Pushkov told Russia s state-run Rossiya-24 TV station.  The head of the U.N. s International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran was complying with the accord, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, under the world s  most robust nuclear verification regime.   The nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran under  the JCPOA are being implemented,  Yukiya Amano, director general of the IAEA said in a statement.  What has been agreed ... must be fully implemented. It is a very important deal, I m sorry to see what is now happening,  former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told reporters at the United Nations on Friday. Ban, who stepped down at the end of 2016, was U.N. chief when the deal was agreed. Trump received support from Israel, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, all of which oppose what they say are Iran s expansionary moves in the Middle East.  President Trump has just created an opportunity to fix this bad deal, to roll back Iran s aggression and to confront its criminal support of terrorism,  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video statement. In their comments, the Gulf states focused on Trump s overall Iran policy rather than the nuclear deal itself. Saudi Arabia welcomed what it called Trump s  decisive strategy  toward Iran and said lifting sanctions had allowed Tehran to develop its ballistic missile program, step up its support for militant groups including Hezbollah and the Houthis in Yemen, and attack global shipping lanes.   The Riyadh government said in a statement it had supported the nuclear agreement,  but Iran took advantage of the economic gain from raising sanctions and used it to continue destabilizing the region . The United Arab Emirates said it fully supported the new U.S. policy toward Iran and renewed its commitment to work with Washington to counter Iran s support of extremism, the state news agency WAM reported.  The UAE announces its full support to the new U.S. strategy to deal with the Iranian policies undermining security and  stability,  WAM said on its Twitter account. ",worldnews,"October 13, 2017 ",0

 Video Of Man Casually Doing Interview After Just Being Shot Goes Viral (VIDEO),"A Quincy, Il, man was shot in the hourly hours of Thursday morning and then right after, did an interview while smoking a cigarette, in what appears to be one of the most interesting interviews of the year.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_wMhAFL188]The Quincy man, Devon, was  in the room, kicking like I usually do, drinking,  when someone fired bullets through his apartment, striking him in the chest.Despite the danger, Devon said that he  wasn t trippin, it was a petty wound and sh*t.  The first thing he thought about wasn t his wound though. His main concern was to get his son out of the way. Luckily, his son wasn t hurt.During the interview, Devon lifted his shirt to show his bandages from the wound, casually shrugging off the event, saying some people  probably want [him] dead  and are  on some other stuff. One can t help but notice how unaffected, calm, and desensitized Devon seems to be, at least while conducting the interview. Even the journalist, Reyna Harvey, who was interviewing him is calm, which lead Chad Douglas a broadcaster at the studio to lament that the entire event was  incredible. While the event is indeed incredible, there seems to be something quite eerie about the desensitization of all involved in this almost tragic event.

China tells Australia off over South China Sea stance,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China s naval chief has told his Australian counterpart that his country s actions on the South China Sea run counter to the general trend of peace and stability in the disputed waterway. Australia, a close ally of the United States, has repeatedly expressed concern over the disputed South China Sea, where China has built manmade islands, some of which are equipped with runways, surface-to-air missiles and radars. Australia has previously drawn criticism from China for running surveillance flights over the South China Sea and supporting U.S. freedom of navigation exercises there. However, Australia has not conducted a unilateral freedom of navigation voyage of its own. China claims most of the South China Sea, a strategic waterway where $3 trillion worth of goods passes every year. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei all have overlapping claims. Meeting in Beijing, China s navy commander Shen Jinlong told Australian Vice Admiral Tim Barrett that at present the situation in the South China Sea was  steady and good , China s Defence Ministry said in a statement late on Thursday.  But in the last year the Australian military s series of actions in the South China Sea have run counter to the general trend of peace and stability,  the ministry cited Shen as saying, without pointing to any specific examples.  This does not accord with the consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries nor the atmosphere of the forward steps in cooperation in all areas between the two countries,  Shen added.  This also is not beneficial to the overall picture of regional peace and stability.  Over the past week or so China and Australia have also traded barbs over Canberra s allegation that Beijing had sought to interfere in Australian politics, with China summoning Australia s ambassador to complain last week. China has continued to install high-frequency radar and other facilities that can be used for military purposes on its man-made islands in the South China Sea, a U.S. think tank said on Thursday. In August, Australia, Japan and the United States urged Southeast Asia and China to ensure that a South China Sea code of conduct they have committed to draw up will be legally binding and said they strongly opposed  coercive unilateral actions .

Factbox: Business empire of Czech election front-runner Babis,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - Andrej Babis, whose ANO movement is heavily tipped to win this weekend s Czech national election, is his country s second-richest man with an empire of chemicals, food processing, farming and media firms.  He also owns a restaurant on the French Riviera with two Michelin stars.  Forbes magazine puts his worth at $4 billion, behind only Petr Kellner at $14.2 billion. Babis said in an interview with Blesk daily this week he had valued his main asset Agrofert at $4.6 billion. Babis set up fertilizer trader Agrofert in 1993 as the Czech unit of Slovakia-based and formerly state-owned trading firm Petrimex that had Babis worked for since the 1970s. He took control of Agrofert in 1995 and has since expanded it, often through acquisitions. Babis moved ownership of Agrofert and his other main firm SynBiol to two trust funds at the beginning of this year. The step was required by new conflict-of-interest legislation that applied to him as finance minister at the time. The two trust funds   AB private trust I and AB private trust II   are managed by long-term collaborators of Babis, Agrofert Chairman Zbynek Prusa and board member Alexej Bilek. Babis s firms receive national and EU subsidies, both regular farming payments and investment aid, have numerous business deals with the public sector, and also depend on government regulation in sectors such as biofuels. Babis, finance minister from 2014 until May this year, has admitted being at some points in conflict of interest but has denied abusing the position. Police charged Babis earlier this month over a 2 million euro EU subsidy awarded in 2008 to one of his projects, Stork Nest, and have also been looking into his past tax strategies which cost him the finance ministry in May. He denies any wrongdoing. A group of over 250 firms and 34,000 employees, it has activities in 18 countries, notably the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany and Hungary, focusing on chemicals, farming, food processing, forestry and media.  Agrofert had sales of 155.3 billion crowns ($7.16 billion) and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of 14.7 billion crowns in 2016. It reported receiving subsidies, mostly EU farming funding, of 1.5 billion crowns last year.  - About 9,000 people work for a host of firms including Deza, Lovochemie, Precheza, Synthesia, Fatra, Slovakia s Duslo and Germany s Stickstoffwerke Piesteritz. - Products include fertilisers, sulfur, aromatic reactants, phenols, tar oils, pigments, acids, salts, PVC, polymers, pesticides, urea. - 103,000 farmed hectares - grains trade, storage, seeds, feed, crop growing and livestock.  - forestry and timber - 16,500 employees  - meat, poultry, dairy, bakeries  - operations in Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany - includes a large new bakery plant in Germany - The largest Czech producer of rapeseed-based biofuels, which are by law mixed into motor fuels. - Major supplier to state-owned fuels distribution firm Cepro. - Babis s most criticized acquisition, including 23 newspapers and magazines, 3 small TV stations and a national radio.  The main asset is MAFRA, the publisher of two national broadsheet daily newspapers, Mlada fronta Dnes and Lidove Noviny as well as free newspapers, magazines and a number of news and entertainment websites, which Babis acquired when he was running in the 2013 election.  MAFRA says it reaches 2.5 million print and 2.8 million internet readers. The purchase sparked an exodus of staff who said they would not work for an owner who was a politician.  Babis has denied ever influencing content although a leaked tape earlier this year suggested he discussed coverage of opponents with a journalist. The journalist was fired.  Media holdings also include Radio Impuls, the largest private radio station by number of listeners.  Firm controlling other main investments. Assets include FutureLife, a network of fertility clinics valued at over 100 million euros; smaller biotech, food and real estate investments. An arm looking after real estate, some farming and other projects, including the conference center and mini-Zoo Capi Hnizdo (Stork Nest), the source of Babis s biggest legal trouble. Police charged Babis with hiding ownership of the project a decade ago so it qualified for a 2 million euro European Union development subsidy which was meant for small business. He denies any wrongdoing. He faces possibly years in jail if convicted.  A restaurant near Cannes, France, that has received two Michelin stars.

China says no excuses for foreign officials meeting Dalai Lama,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Foreign leaders can t think they can get away with meeting exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama just because they are doing it in a personal capacity, as they still represent their government, a senior Chinese official said on Saturday. China considers the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, to be a dangerous separatist. The Nobel Peace Prize winning monk says he simply seeks genuine autonomy for his Himalayan homeland. Visits by the Dalai Lama to foreign countries infuriate China, and fewer and fewer national leaders are willing to meet him, fearing the consequences of Chinese anger, though some have tried to placate Beijing by saying they are meeting him in a personal not official capacity. Zhang Yijiong, who heads the Communist Party s Tibet working group, told reporters on the sidelines of a party congress that there could be no excuses to meeting the Dalai Lama.  Although some people say, the Dalai is a religious figure, our government didn t put in an appearance, it was just individual officials, this is incorrect,  said Zhang, who is also a vice minister at the United Front Work Department, which has led failed talks with the Dalai Lama s representatives.  Officials, in their capacity as officials, attending all foreign-related activities represent their governments. So I hope governments around the world speak and act with caution and give full consideration their friendship with China and their respect for China s sovereignty,  he added.  China took control of Tibet in 1950 in what it calls a  peaceful liberation  and has piled pressure on foreign governments to shun the Dalai Lama, using economic means to punish those who allow him in. China strongly denies accusations of rights abuses in Tibet, saying its rule has brought prosperity to what was a remote and backward region, and that it fully respects the religious and cultural rights of the Tibetan people. China also insists that Tibet in an integral part of its territory and has been for centuries. Zhang, who worked in Tibet from 2006-2010 as a deputy Communist Party boss, said that Tibetan Buddhism was a special religion  born in our ancient China .  It s a Chinese religion. It didn t come in from the outside,  he said. ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",0
Why Not A Probe of ‘Israel-Gate’,"21st Century Wire says Investigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.As the mainstream media in the United States continues to double down on  Russia-Gate , Parry begs the question, why not probe an Israel-Gate.Robert Parry is a past guest of Patrick Henningsen Live on 1100KFNX and Alternate Current Radio and his last interview can be found hereMore on this article from Consortium News  (Image by Brendan Smialowski   AFP)  Robert Parry Consortium NewsThe other day, I asked a longtime Democratic Party insider who is working on the Russia-gate investigation which country interfered more in U.S. politics, Russia or Israel. Without a moment s hesitation, he replied,  Israel, of course. Which underscores my concern about the hysteria raging across Official Washington about  Russian meddling  in the 2016 presidential campaign: There is no proportionality applied to the question of foreign interference in U.S. politics. If there were, we would have a far more substantive investigation of Israel-gate.The problem is that if anyone mentions the truth about Israel s clout, the person is immediately smeared as  anti-Semitic  and targeted by Israel s extraordinarily sophisticated lobby and its many media/political allies for vilification and marginalization.So, the open secret of Israeli influence is studiously ignored, even as presidential candidates prostrate themselves before the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both appeared before AIPAC in 2016, with Clinton promising to take the U.S.-Israeli relationship  to the next level    whatever that meant   and Trump vowing not to  pander  and then pandering like crazy.Congress is no different. It has given Israel s controversial Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a record-tying three invitations to address joint sessions of Congress (matching the number of times British Prime Minister Winston Churchill appeared). We then witnessed the Republicans and Democrats competing to see how often their members could bounce up and down and who could cheer Netanyahu the loudest, even when the Israeli prime minister was instructing the Congress to follow his position on Iran rather than President Obama s.Israeli officials and AIPAC also coordinate their strategies to maximize political influence, which is derived in large part by who gets the lobby s largesse and who doesn t. On the rare occasion when members of Congress step out of line   and take a stand that offends Israeli leaders   they can expect a well-funded opponent in their next race, a tactic that dates back decades.Well-respected members, such as Rep. Paul Findley and Sen. Charles Percy (both Republicans from Illinois), were early victims of the Israeli lobby s wrath when they opened channels of communication with the Palestine Liberation Organization in the cause of seeking peace. Findley was targeted and defeated in 1982; Percy in 1984.Findley recounted his experience in a 1985 book, They Dare to Speak Out: People and Institutions Confront Israel s Lobby, in which Findley called the lobby  the 700-pound gorilla in Washington.  The book was harshly criticized in a New York Times review by Adam Clymer, who called it  an angry, one-sided book that seems often to be little more than a stringing together of stray incidents. Enforced SilenceSince then, there have been fewer and fewer members of Congress or other American politicians who have dared to speak out, judging that   when it comes to the Israeli lobby   discretion is the better part of valor. Today, many U.S. pols grovel before the Israeli government seeking a sign of favor from Prime Minister Netanyahu, almost like Medieval kings courting the blessings of the Pope at the Vatican.During the 2008 campaign, then-Sen. Barack Obama, whom Netanyahu viewed with suspicion, traveled to Israel to demonstrate sympathy for Israelis within rocket-range of Gaza while steering clear of showing much empathy for the Palestinians.In 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney tried to exploit the tense Obama-Netanyahu relationship by stopping in Israel to win a tacit endorsement from Netanyahu. The 2016 campaign was no exception with both Clinton and Trump stressing their love of Israel in their appearances before AIPAC.Money, of course, has become the lifeblood of American politics   and American supporters of Israel have been particularly strategic in how they have exploited that reality.One of Israel s most devoted advocates, casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, has poured millions of dollars in  dark money  into political candidates and groups that support Israel s interests. Adelson, who has advocated dropping a nuclear bomb inside Iran to coerce its government, is a Trump favorite having donated a record $5 million to Trump s inaugural celebration.Of course, many Israel-connected political donations are much smaller but no less influential. A quarter century ago, I was told how an aide to a Democratic foreign policy chairman, who faced a surprisingly tough race after redistricting, turned to the head of AIPAC for help and, almost overnight, donations were pouring in from all over the country. The chairman was most thankful.The October Surprise MysteryIsrael s involvement in U.S. politics also can be covert. For instance, the evidence is now overwhelming that the Israeli government of right-wing Prime Minister Menachem Begin played a key role in helping Ronald Reagan s campaign in 1980 strike a deal with Iran to frustrate President Jimmy Carter s efforts to free 52 American hostages before Election Day.Begin despised Carter for the Camp David Accords that forced Israel to give back the Sinai to Egypt. Begin also believed that Carter was too sympathetic to the Palestinians and   if he won a second term   would conspire with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to impose a two-state solution on Israel.Begin s contempt for Carter was not even a secret. In a 1991 book, The Last Option, senior Israeli intelligence and foreign policy official David Kimche explained Begin s motive for dreading Carter s re-election. Kimche said Israeli officials had gotten wind of  collusion  between Carter and Sadat  to force Israel to abandon her refusal to withdraw from territories occupied in 1967, including Jerusalem, and to agree to the establishment of a Palestinian state. Kimche continued,  This plan prepared behind Israel s back and without her knowledge must rank as a unique attempt in United States s diplomatic history of short-changing a friend and ally by deceit and manipulation. But Begin recognized that the scheme required Carter winning a second term in 1980 when, Kimche wrote,  he would be free to compel Israel to accept a settlement of the Palestinian problem on his and Egyptian terms, without having to fear the backlash of the American Jewish lobby. In a 1992 memoir, Profits of War, former Israeli intelligence officer Ari Ben-Menashe also noted that Begin and other Likud leaders held Carter in contempt. Begin loathed Carter for the peace agreement forced upon him at Camp David,  Ben-Menashe wrote.  As Begin saw it, the agreement took away Sinai from Israel, did not create a comprehensive peace, and left the Palestinian issue hanging on Israel s back. So, in order to buy time for Israel to  change the facts on the ground  by moving Jewish settlers into the West Bank, Begin felt Carter s reelection had to be prevented. A different president also presumably would give Israel a freer hand to deal with problems on its northern border with Lebanon.Ben-Menashe was among a couple of dozen government officials and intelligence operatives who described how Reagan s campaign, mostly through future CIA Director William Casey and past CIA Director George H.W.

OBAMA DEFENDS KAEPERNICK’S Decision to Disrespect American Flag: “He’s generated more interest in something that needs to be talked about”,"When Obama had the opportunity to speak out against 49er s quarterback Colin Kaepernick s disrespect for our flag, he chose instead to defend his actions, explaining that it was okay for him to sit out the national anthem, as long as he was bringing attention to the cop-hating/killing, divisive Black Lives Matter terror group President Obama said San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick is  exercising his constitutional right  to sit out the national anthem, but the president acknowledged that the silent protest is a  tough thing  for military service members to accept.At a news conference in China on Monday, the president said he did not doubt Kaepernick s sincerity in his decision not to stand for the anthem ahead of games to protest the treatment of African Americans by law enforcement in U.S. cities. Obama noted a  long history  of sports figures protesting political or social issues. There are a lot of ways you can do it,  Obama said after the G-20 summit here.  As a general matter when it comes to the flag and the national anthem and the meaning that holds for our men and women in uniform and those who fought for us   that is a tough thing for them to get past to then hear what his deeper concerns are. But I don t doubt his sincerity. I think he cares about some real, legitimate issues that have to be talked about. If nothing else, he s generated more conversation about issues that have to be talked about. Obama said he has not closely followed the controversy surrounding Kaepernick s actions while he has been overseas, but he said he was aware of the public response, which has been sharply divided. The president has sought to balance his own response to the unrest and mistrust between African Americans and police officers over the past several years, including in Baton Rouge and Dallas this year. You ve heard me talk in the past about the need for us to have an active citizenry,  Obama said.  Sometimes that s messy and controversial and gets people angry and frustrated. But I d rather have young people that are engaged in the argument and trying to think through how they can be part of our democratic process than people just sitting on the sidelines not participating at all. My suspicion is that over time he s going to refine how he thinks about it. Maybe some of his critics will start seeing that he had a point about concerns about justice and equality. That s how we move forward.    Washington Post",left-news,"Sep 5, 2016",1
"Clinton to release 2015 tax returns within days, criticizes Trump","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will release her 2015 tax returns and her running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, will release the last 10 years of their tax returns within days, according to a source close to Clinton. The returns will show Clinton paid an effective tax rate of 35 percent and gave about 10 percent to charity, CNBC reported. The release comes as Republican Donald Trump is facing criticism for not releasing his tax returns - a political practice that is not required by law but has been done by every White House nominee since 1973. “He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns,” Clinton said on Thursday in an economic speech in Michigan.   Clinton’s campaign has already released tax returns going back to 2007. In addition, tax returns are publicly available for the eight years her husband, former President Bill Clinton, was in the White House. Prior years were released by his campaign. Tax returns filed by the Clintons have been made public, in some form, for every year back to 1977. Trump, a New York businessman, has refused to release his tax returns, saying they are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service. He has said he is unlikely to do so before the Nov. 8 presidential election.  Critics, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, have blasted Trump for failing to disclose his tax rate and raised questions about what his returns say about his net worth and various business ties, particularly in Russia.     Asked in a television interview in May what tax rate he pays, Trump replied “It’s none of your business.” The IRS has said Trump can release his tax returns even while under audit. Besides showing sources and amounts of income, tax returns show what percentage tax rate a person ultimately pays, as well as how much they claimed in deductions and the amounts given to charities.   Earlier this month, at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, billionaire investor Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to make his returns public. “I’m under audit, too, and I would be delighted to meet him anyplace, anytime, before the election,” Buffett said. “I’ll bring my tax return, he can bring his tax return ... and let people ask us questions.” Trump has declined to do so.

 Idaho Republican OUTRAGEOUSLY Says Female Lawmakers Only Rise In Rank By Giving Sexual Favors,"A member of the Idaho House of Representatives has been punished for making absolutely offensive accusations against every female lawmaker.After Rep. Judy Boyle was named the chair of the House Agriculture Committee, Rep. Heather Scott remarked that Boyle got the position because female lawmakers  spread their legs  to rise in rank, suggesting that women perform sexual favors to get leadership positions.The incident occurred on December 1st in the House lounge and the remark was said loudly enough that several witnesses heard it.Scott then repeated the remark in the House chamber, not only upsetting female lawmakers, but male lawmakers as well. That s not true,  Rep. Stephen Hartgen, told the Spokesman-Review in response to Scott s claim.  I ve been here almost 10 years. People get ahead here on the basis of merit, in my humble opinion. I ve never seen anything that would cause me to question that premise. Rep. Christy Perry also blasted Scott s behavior.  It s important to me that the public understands that it s absolutely a false allegation   that it s not what happens in this building. It s extremely disrespectful. A number of the lady legislators are very upset about this. It s just entirely inappropriate. And the Idaho legislature responded as a whole by stripping Scott of all her committee assignments.According to the Statesman Review,As the House convened today, it moved to the 13th order, and the clerk read the list of committee assignments, listing all members of three committees   Commerce, Environment and State Affairs. Missing from all three was the name of Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard.So maybe Scott will think twice about what she wants to say next time she wants to react to her colleagues getting leadership roles. Because spreading lies about how those positions were attained won t earn her any respect.Let s hope the voters in Scott s district follow up by kicking her out of office in the next election.Featured image via Electablog",News,"January 14, 2017",1
" Samantha Bee Invited Trump Fans To A Party, And All Hell Broke Loose (VIDEO)","Full Frontal host Samantha Bee braced herself and attempted a dialogue with Trump fans away from the mud-slinging happening across the internet. She gave Trump s followers a chance to show a better side of themselves and they blew it. Bee didn t cheat. She didn t walk into a roadside bar and grab a couple drunks with KKK t-shirts on. She invited a diverse array of Trump supporters: women, gay, black, Asian, college graduates, bi-partisan. All were represented. The common theme: none of them were able to put forward a single coherent response when asked the most simple questions about their candidate. And when pressed, all hit the hot button of anger.The host begins by showing footage of some of the racist violence spilling out at Trump rallies across the country. This includes the moment John Franklin McGraw of North Carolina sucker-punching a black protester and threatening to kill him (Trump later stated he would pay the attacker s legal bills, and those of anyone arrested for violence at his rallies).While Trump pinned the blame for violence on Bernie Sanders supporters, Bee showed footage of Trump fans telling bystanders to go to Auschwitz. Go to f**king Auschwitz.  Clearly, not a Sanders fan.But, Bee states, surely the millions of Trump supporters across the country can t be hysterical racists? There must be some sane, rational, people who are choosing to back Trump too. So she picked a sample and offered to put on a lavish party for them in exchange for an open conversation about their candidate and their views.It s actually more terrifying than the racist violence. What you see is smart, open-minded people  choking down their own souls to belong. Bee starts by asking the group how they feel about their candidates statements on banning muslims from the country. Temporarily!  they say, almost in unison.  For our national security. As if this somehow resolves the dilemma. They take no issue with lumping the world s 1.7 billion Muslims together as terrorists.However, when Bee asks them how they feel about white supremacists backing their candidate, they are up in arms at the lumping together of themselves with other Trump fans. One supporter doesn t even look remotely convinced of her own argument as she mumbles: We all love America, I guess. If there s something we can come together on, we want this country to be great, I think everyone can get behind that. Getting angry at the clear embarrassment this question has caused the group, one supporter strikes out with: It s clearly illogical to play the guilt-by-association game because we could do this all day long, To which Bee points out that they have no problem playing that game against Muslims.Silence.Bee moves on, asking the group how they feel about the racist violence breaking out at Trump rallies. They argue that the media is continuing to quote Trump out of context. So Bee plays the video of Trump inciting the crowd to attack a protester, stating that he would do it himself. She turns to the group and asks: Can you acknowledge that it is literally impossible, as a member of the media, to ignore a person when they say they would punch a protester in the face? One supporter dismisses the question out of hand, stating that if you get enough people in a space, somebody is always going to get punched in the face. Ok.Bee mingles around the the party, and chats to the woman who stated that Trump would bring America together. She tells Bee she really wants the wall, to keep out undesirables. When asked who will pay for it, the woman states with glee that Mexico will. Bee s fact checker points out that Mexico is on the record as stating they will not pay for the wall. To which the woman replies, wide-eyed: And you know what Trump said? The wall just got 10 feet taller! Her final chat at the party is with a man clearly on the verge of rage. Bee states that he is making her feel uncomfortable because although he is smiling, there is real anger in his eyes. With another burst of barely suppressed rage and pointing a finger in Bee s face, the man states: There s no anger, it s passion. Don t mistake that. Bee signs off with a resigned sigh that we have to withstand 8 months more of this  passion , while a rolling a montage of violence at Trump rallies.What is clear from the footage is that there s no way of holding a rational argument with a zealot. And what s clear from the Trump fan party is that he is encouraging zealotry, the unquestioning evangelism of Trump, in groups that might otherwise display all the signs of being critical thinkers and evidence-based voters. That is way if anything, this bizarre party is more terrifying than the hysterical scenes at the rallies   because these people know better, and they re choosing to be sucked into the dark world of Donald Trump anyway.

SERIOUSLY? PRO-ILLEGAL ALIEN Supporters Demand Cops Explain Why They Can’t Physically Attack Trump Supporters [VIDEO],"The video begins with a clearly agitated pro-illegal alien female approaching Trump supporters. After a few of the agitators who were part of her group began to act in a hostile and threatening manner, police officers stepped in to form a barrier between the groups. The human barrier they formed was clearly not okay with the agitators who were looking to use physical force to shut up and shut down their opponents. Shortly after the police officer explained that the Trump supporters had a permit (which means nothing to people who have no regard for the law and are actually protesting on behalf of lawbreakers), another man who appears to be Hispanic, wearing a hoodie began to aggressively approach the crowd. We re not sure if these people were being paid to threaten the pro-Trump supporters or if they just happened to be angry supporters of illegal aliens, and were in the area.The Hispanic man on the pro-Trump side in the background, who was holding a  Deport Illegals  sign can be heard telling the pro-illegal agitators that he s  a legal American citizen  and he stands by President Trump. He hilariously follows up his comment with,  Homies for Trump.

DON’T LET HILLARY HIJACK THE FLINT WATER CRISIS: Audit Finds State Regulators At Fault,"Hillary Clinton came to visit the citizens of Flint recently and then campaign commercials popped up claiming the Flint residents would be  saved  by Granny Clinton. It s what she does best pandering to the black community. She wants the people to believe that the Republicans have decided to poison the people of Flint and she s here to save the day. Well, we ve got the truth and we re hoping you ll spread it far and wide. This is about STATE regulators who dropped the ball when Flint switched from Detroit water to Flint:FLINT, Mich. (AP)   Michigan environmental regulators made crucial errors as Flint began using a new drinking water source that would become contaminated with lead, auditors said Friday, as crews in the city started to dig up old pipes connecting water mains to homes.The report by the state auditor general found that staffers in the Department of Environmental Quality s drinking water office failed to order the city to treat its water with anti-corrosion chemicals as it switched to the Flint River in April 2014, but also said the rules they failed to heed may not be strong enough to protect the public.Flint had been using water from the Detroit system but made the change to save money, planning eventually to join a consortium that would have its own pipeline to the lake. The corrosive river water scraped lead from aging pipes that tainted water in some homes and schools, and has been blamed for elevated lead levels in some children s bloodstreams. If consumed, lead can cause developmental delays and learning disabilities.Crews on Friday dug up a lead service line in Flint and replaced it with a copper one at the home of an expectant couple. It marked the first residential lead pipe removal that is part of Mayor Karen Weaver s Fast Start initiative designed to replace all lead service lines in the city.Barry Richardson II, who lives in the home with his pregnant fiancee, thanked mayor and said he no longer will  have to worry about the lead poisoning  his water.Weaver said the work that started Friday will target lead service lines at homes in neighborhoods with the highest number of children under 6 years old, senior citizens, pregnant women, people with compromised immune systems and homes where water tests indicate high levels of lead at the tap.More than two dozen Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, also visited Flint on Friday to hear from families affected by the water crisis. Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee of Michigan said it let lawmakers hear about Flint s problems firsthand and kept up pressure for Congress to act on a stalled bill aimed at helping the city. Kildee criticized Senate Republicans for delaying the bill and noted that lawmakers who have visited Flint in recent weeks were all Democrats.Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, who has repeatedly apologized for the state s response, said it s taking longer than expected to locate all the lead pipes in the city but the state is working to find them.The DEQ has acknowledged that its staffers who worked with Flint misread federal regulations designed to prevent lead and copper pollution of drinking water supplies. Three DEQ employees, including the director, have lost their jobs.Director Keith Creagh said Friday the DEQ appreciates the auditor general s  thorough review  and  is committed to developing and implementing process and program improvements to address the findings in the report. But the DEQ said the federal Lead and Copper Rule was ambiguous, and the auditors agreed, saying it and Michigan s Safe Water Drinking Act needed improvements. Snyder said he d also like to set a higher water quality standard than the federal rule.The audit said the federal rule does not require using indicators such as blood screenings to monitor for human exposure to lead. Sampling of drinking water that does take place relies mostly on samples from single-family residences, leaving out other locations such as schools and hospitals.Additionally, many samples are taken by residents, who might use incorrect procedures, the report said.Other DEQ shortcomings it noted included a failure to ensure that Flint drew enough water samples for testing from high-risk homes with lead pipes or fixtures. The agency said it would  put in place appropriate audit procedures that will increase the confidence and accuracy of water supply submissions. DEQ also does not conduct surveillance visits, sanitary surveys and other monitoring within required time frames, a problem in places other than Flint, the report said. The department said 95 percent of sanitary surveys and 64 percent of surveillance visits meet required deadlines, exceeding goals set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.Via: KMOV",politics,"Mar 6, 2016",1

Syrian government push for Damascus rebel enclave kills at least 23,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - An intensifying push by the Syrian government and allied forces to take the last major rebel stronghold near the capital Damascus killed at least 23 people on Sunday and injured many, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The group said at least 127 people, including 30 children, have been killed by air strikes and shelling since the Syrian army backed by Russian jets began an offensive nearly two weeks ago to take the besieged rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area. Eastern Ghouta is one of several  de-escalation  zones across western Syria, where Russia has brokered deals to ease the fighting between rebels and President Bashar al-Assad s government. A Reuters witness said there had been drones in the sky since Sunday morning and warplanes had heavily bombarded the towns of Mesraba and Harasta. Heavy shelling also hit Eastern Ghouta and dozens had been injured.    Assad s forces have besieged Eastern Ghouta since 2012 and the area is suffering a humanitarian crisis.  Ghouta residents are so short of food that they are eating trash, fainting from hunger and forcing their children to eat on alternate days, the U.N. World Food Programme said in a report this week.      The opposition Eastern Ghouta Damascus Countryside local council said this week the escalating bombardment was forcing people to seek shelter in unsuitable and unsanitary places which it feared could lead to disease outbreaks.  A number of shells from the rebel enclave have hit government-held Damascus in the past two weeks.       Syria s six-year-old civil war has killed hundreds of thousands of people and forced millions to flee in the worst refugee crisis since World War Two.   U.N.-backed peace negotiations are due to begin in Geneva on Nov. 28. Several previous rounds of Geneva talks have failed to agree a political transition for Syria or a way to stop the violence.    Yahya Aridi, spokesman for the Syrian opposition Geneva delegation, said on Sunday it was now time for the Syrian government and the opposition to  get to the table and start talking about transition, from dictatorship to freedom  in Geneva.

"WRONG COLOR: If Left Really Cared About Police Brutality, They’d Be Protesting Death Of White 6 Yr Old Autistic Boy Whose Dad Was Unarmed With “Hands Up” [VIDEO]","As it turns out, police brutality really isn t the issue at all. It s about dividing a nation down racial lines and the good police men and women are just part of a scheme by the Left that is being orchestrated in the highest office of our nation Police investigating the fatal shooting of a six-year-old autistic boy by two Louisiana state marshals are looking into whether one of the cops had a grudge with the child s father.Jeremy Mardis was shot five times in the head and chest as he sat in the passenger seat of his father Chris Few s car last week by officers Derrick Stafford, 32, and Norris Greenhouse.Investigators are exploring the possibility that Greenhouse, 23, had a personal issue with Few, after Few s fianc e Megan Dixon said the marshal had been messaging her on Facebook and coming round to their home.Ms Dixon has previously said she  was the reason this all started , adding that she knew what happened in the moments leading up to the shooting.Few and Ms Dixon were drinking Budweisers and shots of tequila in T.J. s Lounge and pool bar that evening before getting into an argument, the Denver Post reported.She announced to the bar that they were not seeing each other any more and started dancing with one of the barmen.Few reportedly stormed out of the bar, kicking a door as he left, before getting into a blazing row with Ms Dixon in the parking lot.They drove off in different vehicles and someone called 911.A short while later, after Few had picked up Jeremy, he pulled up next to Ms Dixon at a red light and asked her to come home with him. She said she declined because she was  stubborn .As she pulled away, Ms Dixon said she saw two marshals  cars approaching from behind with their lights flashing.She said she saw Few was pointing at his son s head, showing that he was in the car and he wasn t sure what to do.According to investigators, Few drove down a cul-de-sac as marshals Greenhouse and Stafford came round the corner.Police say Few started reversing and at this point the men opened fire, pumping 18 bullets into the SUV, five of which hit Jeremy in the head and chest.Police are investigating whether Greenhouse (left) had a grudge with Few, who was said to have confronted the cop over Facebook messages and visit to his fiancee. Pictured right, StaffordFew s attorney says footage from a bodycam worn by one of the cops shows the father putting his hands up before the officers started firing.Col. Edmonson on Friday described the footage as  the most disturbing thing I ve seen .He added:  That video was incredible. I mean, as a father, much less head of the state police, I looked at that tape, I said this is incredibly disturbing. Initial reports suggested the marshals had a warrant but it was subsequently discovered that they did not, and it is not known why they pursued Few.Greenhouse and Stafford were charged with second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder. They are being held on $1million bonds.As you can see here, these two cops were about as bad as two cops can be.

"Paul Manafort, Special Counsel Mueller tussle over Ukrainian op-ed","(Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort did not violate a court gag order when he helped edit an opinion piece about his political work in Ukraine, his defense lawyer Kevin Downing argued in a court filing on Thursday. A federal grand jury indicted Manafort and his business associate Rick Gates in October as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into accusations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The charges against Manafort include conspiracy to launder money and failing to register as a foreign agent working on behalf of former pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s government, who was ousted in 2014.     Thursday’s filing came after prosecutors working for Mueller said earlier this week that they no longer could agree to more lenient bail terms for Manafort after discovering that he was working with a colleague tied to Russian intelligence agencies on an opinion piece that cast his work in a favorable light.     Mueller’s office argued that his efforts to work behind the scenes on the piece as recently as November 30 ran afoul of the judge’s November 8 order instructing all parties to refrain from making statements to the media or in public settings that could prejudice the case. Jason Maloni, a spokesman for Manafort, declined to comment.  Joshua Stueve, a spokesman for Mueller, also declined to comment. Downing said in Thursday’s filing that his client was involved only in editing the piece to ensure accuracy, and that it would not prejudice the case because it was ultimately published in a Ukrainian newspaper, not an American one. “The defense did not, and does not, understand that the	 court meant to impose a gag order	 precluding Mr. Manafort from addressing matters, which do not ‘pose a substantial	 likelihood of	 material prejudice to this case,’” Downing wrote. Earlier in the week, prosecutors said in a filing that they had reached out to Manafort’s lawyers when they discovered the draft and had been assured that it would not be published. The piece appeared online in the English-language Kyiv Post on Thursday. The article, which was authored by Oleg Voloshyn, a former spokesman for Ukraine’s foreign affairs ministry, praised   Manafort’s political work in helping Ukraine secure better relations with the European Union. “I can only wonder why some American media dare falsely claim that Paul Manafort lobbied Russian interests in Ukraine,” the piece said. “Without his input Ukraine would not have had the command focus on reforms that were required to be a nation candidate to the EU.”   Brian Bonner, the chief editor at the Kyiv Post, told Reuters that the article was submitted on Monday. Bonner said Voloshyn claimed to have written the article and then sent it to Manafort and the American’s longtime Russian colleague, Konstantin Kilimnik, for fact-checking before submission.  Bonner said he did not immediately publish the article because he was suspicious of the contents and wanted to confirm that Voloshyn had written it.   “It was blatantly pro-Manafort with an opinion about his activities that most people don’t share and that his record in Ukraine doesn’t support,” Bonner wrote in an email.  Voloshyn told Reuters he was not immediately in a position to comment. It was not clear when U.S. District judge Amy Berman Jackson would decide the issue, but Manafort and Gates are due to appear before her on Monday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for a status hearing.

 NC Republicans PROUDLY Brag About How Well Their Voter Suppression Tactics Are Working,"While the Supreme Court blocked the worst of North Carolina s voter suppression laws (including their voter ID law, and their decisions to cut early voting and end same-day registration across the state), the state s Republican Party still managed to find ways to cut early voting to harm the state s black citizens, as well as intimidate them into not voting. Sickeningly, it seems to have worked.And they re bragging about it in a press release. Openly. Loudly. Proudly. Gleefully. The title reads,  NCGOP Sees Encouraging Early Voting, Obama/Clinton Coalition Tired, Fail to Resonate in North Carolina. That would all well and good if it were actually true. What they re really doing, though, is bragging about lower black voter turnout and higher white voter turnout.  North Carolina Obama Coalition Crumbling,  is the heading of one section of the release, and it highlights the decrease in black voter turnout in the state between 2012 and now.Image via NC GOPSure, whites and minorities are two different demographics, but keep in mind that the Supreme Court blocked their voter suppression law because  the new provisions targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision.  In response to that, Governor Pat McCrory threw a tantrum, and the state went about finding other ways of suppressing voters.The party s solution to the Supreme Court s ruling was to pressure individual county boards to limit early voting, especially Sunday voting, and many did despite the fact that the black community overwhelmingly votes early, and often on Sunday after church. The state s elections board mitigated some of these restrictions, but not all, and the black and student communities were still disproportionately harmed.Other states in the South have shown increases of black voters during early voting as much as 18 percent in one case but North Carolina saw a sharp decline:Something went very wrong for African-Americans  voting in North Carolina pic.twitter.com/ZpwjyEavmd  Michael McDonald (@ElectProject) November 6, 2016What s happened is that Republicans knew they d lose the state if minority voters were able to vote more easily because they tend to vote Democratic. A longtime GOP consultant even said that, if black voters voted Republican, none of these suppression tactics would ever have been considered.It s bad enough that they ve worked so hard to severely curtail the right to vote in order to maintain control of the state, and try and deliver a White House win to Herr Trump. To openly brag about it like this, though? They just reinforced the fact that this was literally about suppressing votes, not ensuring voting rights remained intact and without fraud.Featured image by Brian Blanco via Getty Images",News,"November 7, 2016",1
"Attack ads, protests and phone calls: selling the Supreme Court nominee","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As President Barack Obama unveiled his Supreme Court nominee on Wednesday, a carefully crafted operation to sell his choice to Americans and to resistant Republicans rolled into action. Liberal groups announced a national campaign to target Republican Senate opponents with demonstrations and television ads in what is likely to be one of the most bitter fights ever over a Supreme Court nomination.  The White House has enlisted legal scholars and corporate executives to make the case for centrist judge Merrick Garland despite resistance from Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and other senior Republicans who have said Obama should let the next president fill the position. Garland himself, an appeals-court judge, immediately started making calls to Capitol Hill, signaling the start of a battle for public perceptions as Obama seeks to highlight what Democrats characterize as unprecedented obstructionism. The pressure may not be enough to convince Republicans to give Garland a hearing, let alone a confirmation vote.  But the White House is betting that since many Republicans face tough re-election battles, they may be less willing to reject Garland out of hand.  The White House has enlisted former White House officials Stephanie Cutter and Katie Beirne Fallon to mobilize liberal groups, which see the fight as a historic chance to push the Supreme Court to the left as well as mobilize their supporters ahead of the elections. “We’re going to organize in record numbers,” said Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, which plans rallies outside the offices of Republican senators in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin and New Hampshire starting next week. Republicans likely won’t be swayed by such messages, but voters may be, said Michael Gottlieb, a lawyer at Washington firm Boies, Schiller, & Flexner who was involved with the last four Supreme Court nominations. “What moves the needle is if your average person, an independent voter or a moderate Republican, sees inaction on a nominee as the Senate not doing its job,” Gottlieb said.  Some 57 percent of Americans believe Obama should name a replacement for the vacant seat while 33 percent say he should not, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.  Events planned by a slew of Democrat-linked groups will feature “working Americans telling Senate Republicans to do their jobs,” according to a former White House official who is involved in the efforts. Social media will play a big part. A petition under the Twitter tag #DoYouJob has already collected 1.5 million signatures.  A central target is Republican Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, who has said any Obama nominee would not get a hearing before his Judiciary Committee.  Facing a tough Democratic challenger and pressure from liberal activists, Grassley talked with Garland by phone on Wednesday and held out the possibility of a meeting.  Democratic aides say they aim to pressure Grassley into holding a hearing. Whether he does or not, they see Grassley in the meantime struggling to justify his current hard-line position, which they think could help his Democratic opponent in November, former Lieutenant Governor Patty Judge. RE-ELECTION WORRIES Republican senators facing re-election in New Hampshire, Illinois, and Ohio have said they are willing to meet with Garland. Democrats view those seats as among the most promising targets in their effort to win back control of the 100-seat body. Some 34 seats are up for grabs in the Senate, where Republicans have a 54-46 seat majority.  Democrats say the fight could make Senate races in Missouri and North Carolina competitive as well, though independent analysts say they still face an uphill climb. With the election still seven months away, “it will be tough to keep the issue at the forefront of voters’ minds,” said Nathan Gonzales, who tracks elections for the Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report.  Despite the political overtones, Obama opted to pick a relatively uncontroversial candidate. Garland, the top judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, is viewed as a centrist who is not ideologically driven.  Some conservative groups say Garland’s past rulings indicate that he would push the court to the left on gun rights, government regulations and other key issues. But others plan to keep the focus on Obama, not his nominee.  “If you start eviscerating him in the public sphere, you’re going to create sympathy and the White House will use that,” said Jason Pye, a spokesman for libertarian group FreedomWorks. Members of the network have sent more than 500,000 emails urging Republican senators to stick to their position, he said. The White House said it had enlisted 356 legal scholars, 217 corporate lawyers and 17 environmental executives in a letter-writing campaign urging Republican senators to act. Some on the left say they may have a hard time rallying their members behind a centrist, 63-year-old white male candidate. “We have to go where grassroots energy is. We can’t just manufacture it out of thin air,” said Neil Sroka, a spokesman for Democracy For Action, a network of 1 million progressive activists. ",politicsNews,"March 17, 2016 ",0
 Trump’s America: White Supremacist Blogger Given Job As Federal Judge,"The most controversial judicial nominee on President Trump s list was just confirmed on Thursday in a U.S. Senate vote catastrophe.Meet John Bush, a lawyer from Kentucky and an outspoken political blogger who bashes on gay rights and who believes that the Roe v. Wade decision was equally as deplorable as the Supreme Court s 1857 pro-slavery decision.This right-wing nutjob is now the newest judge on the 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.John Bush has published over 400 articles in his career as a right-wing blogger. Under a fake pen name, he regularly cites conspiracy theories and fake news stories from alt-right media reports   including the ridiculous story that President Obama was born outside the U.S.During his confirmation hearing, Bush attempted to downplay his destructive alt-right views as  political activity.  He openly made a pledge to separate his personal politics from his work as a judge on the courtroom bench.The confirmation hearing final vote came in with 51-47, without Republican John McCain.This is the fourth judicial nominee of Trump s to win confirmation, with twenty-two pending nominations. There are far more judicial vacancies on the federal bench than usual, and Trump is actively seeking to fill the slots. The president is looking for judges who are conservative but also young and able to serve for a long time in an effort to permanently shift the judiciary over to conservative activists. At this rate, Trump will quickly erase the judicial nomination gains made by the Obama administration over his entire two terms.Feature Image Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Image ",News,"July 23, 2017",1
British government extends Northern Ireland talks deadline,"BELFAST (Reuters) - The British government on Monday extended by 24 hours a deadline for Northern Ireland s political parties to re-establish a devolved regional executive and avoid London setting the region s annual budget for the first time in a decade.  The pro-British Democratic Unionist Party and the Irish nationalist Sinn Fein party made progress in talks on Monday and they will continue talking on Tuesday, the British government s minister for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire said.   In the light of this, I believe it is right to defer the assessment on whether to introduce legislation to Parliament this week to enable an executive to be formed,  Brokenshire said in a statement.  The parties will recommence talks in the morning and I will reassess the position tomorrow night,  he said, adding that the British government would consider  certain additional requests  made by the parties.        Brokenshire had earlier indicated that if there was no deal by the end of Monday it would move to pass an annual budget for the region to ensure essential services are funded.  A budget set by the British government would be a major step towards direct rule from London for the first time in a decade, which observers have warned could destabilize a delicate political balance in the region.  The DUP and Sinn Fein have shared power for the past decade in a system created following a 1998 peace deal which ended three decades of violence in the province. But Sinn Fein in January pulled out complaining it was not being treated as an equal partner.  Talks between Sinn Fein and the DUP have stalled in recent weeks, in large part over proposals to improve the rights of Irish language speakers. Ahead of the talks, Sinn Fein regional assembly member Conor Murphy said the government could only be reformed  on the basis of equality, rights and respect , which would require concessions from the DUP.   While the DUP also said it wanted to see the executive re-established, ahead of the talks it called for London to bring forward the budget  to bring a measure of good government to Northern Ireland . Neither party spoke to assembled media on the state of the talks on Monday evening.  The outcome of talks was not expected to have an impact on the DUP s agreement to support British Prime Minister Theresa May s government in the British parliament. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",0
 REPORT: Fox News Might Be Under Investigation By Federal Authorities,"If federal authorities discover what they are reportedly looking for, the Republican propaganda network could be in deep sh*t.Last year, Roger Ailes was ousted as Fox News boss because Gretchen Carlson and other female anchors filed sexual harassment lawsuits.According to Carlson s lawsuit, Ailes punished her after she refused to have sex with him. He constantly ogled her and told her to wear short skirts to emphasize her legs. He also allowed misogyny to run rampant. Carlson even named current Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy in the lawsuit.First, Ailes demoted Carlson by removing her from Fox & Friends. And then he fired her after she continued to refuse to sleep with him to further her career.The case against Ailes was so damning that even Megyn Kelly defended Carlson.Eventually, Ailes settled the lawsuit and Fox News paid Carlson $20 million. Ailes was then fired by the company and given a $40 million severance package.And that money is the source of a possible investigation that federal authorities are considering or already moving forward with.Andrea Tantaros  lawyer Judd Burstein, who is representing her in her sexual harassment lawsuit against Fox News and Roger Ailes, recently received a subpoena from federal prosecutors. And he told the Hollywood Reporter what it means. Once I saw it, I knew what was happening,  Burstein said.  They were investigating whether Fox News violated securities laws by not reporting settlements to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In other words, Fox News may have settled the lawsuit against Ailes without informing the shareholders of the decision to pay Carlson $20 million while also agreeing to pay Ailes $40 million. Their haste to quickly sweep the lawsuit out of national headlines would be a violation of rules set up by the Securities and Exchange Commission.In a statement following the report, Fox News claimed the corporation has not received a subpoena, but did say they have been in contact with U.S. Attorneys. The court granted FOX News  motion to send Andrea Tantaros  case to arbitration, where it always belonged, and rejected her counsel Judd Burstein s histrionics. Apparently one of Mr. Burstein s other clients has received a subpoena. Neither FOX News nor 21CF has received a subpoena, but we have been in communication with the U.S. Attorney s office for months. We have and will continue to cooperate on all inquiries with any interested authorities. If Fox News gets busted for not informing their shareholders they could end up paying a hefty fine to settle with the SEC. That just takes more money out of Rupert Murdoch s pockets and could make it more difficult for the company to make huge offers to Fox hosts and anchors to stick around when it s time to renew contracts. It would be a major financial setback for the conservative propaganda machine.Hopefully, federal authorities are able to launch or continue their investigation without interference from Donald Trump.Featured image via Dangerous Minds",News,"February 15, 2017",1

"#CrookedHillary’s Karma! NEW POLL Shows Trump Takes Lead In BLUE STATES: Michigan, Wisconsin, New Hampshire And Maine","Just think how Trump s polling numbers would look if the media wasn t beating the anti-Trump drum 24/7 and if Hillary was forced to talk to reporters about the rash of new evidence uncovered by conservative media over the past two weeks Ipsos is a top-ranked polling firm   and it is producing a series of state polls showing Donald Trump doing dramatically better than the polls by other trusted polling firms. Those Ipsos state polls show Trump clinching leads in New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Maine.That s really big because President Barack Obama won all those states in 2012. Obama won Wisconsin by 6.7 points, Michigan by 9.5 points, Maine by 15.1 points, and New Hampshire by 5.8 points.The firm s accumulation of state polls, however, still leaves Clinton far ahead of Trump in total electoral votes.The likely difference between Ipsos   which conducts polling for the Reuters news service   and the many other polling firms is their turnout prediction for November. Winning the White House depends as much on who comes out to vote as which candidate Americans prefer. Each week, we poll more than 15,000 people, then factor in likely turnout among key demographics to see how voting would play out in the Electoral College,  according to Ipsos. Currently, Reuters/Ipsos estimates overall turnout at around 60%, although that rate varies among different demographic groups. Minority turnout, for example, is expected to be about 43%, while about 59% of African-American women and 69% of White men are projected to cast ballots,  according to a site run by Reuters and Ipsos.

HOW MUSLIM IT WORKERS FOR Democrats Sold US Intel to Foreign Agents [Video],"Judge Napolitano had this to say about the DNC s Muslim IT worker:  He was arrested for some financial crime. That s the tip of the iceberg. The real crime against him was that he had contact, he had access to emails of every member of Congress and he sold what he found in there. What did he sell and to whom did he sell it. That s what the FBI wants to know. This may be a very, very serious national security investigation. We ve been reporting this scandal for months but it s just now heating up. The most of the main stream media has been silent on this serious national security breach within the DNC. The FBI is investigating who was given top secret information by the DNC IT workers who had email access to everyone in Congress!The puzzling part of this entire scandal is that the payment was outrageous! Over $4 million was given to this family and associates!THE DAILY CALLER REPORTED ON THIS BREACH OF SECURITY WAY BACK IN FEBRUARY WHEN THE BROTHERS WERE FIRED:Three brothers who managed office information technology for members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and other lawmakers were abruptly relieved of their duties on suspicion that they accessed congressional computers without permission.Brothers Abid, Imran, and Jamal Awan were barred from computer networks at the House of Representatives Thursday, The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group has learned.Three members of the intelligence panel and five members of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs were among the dozens of members who employed the suspects on a shared basis. The two committees deal with many of the nation s most sensitive issues and documents, including those related to the war on terrorism.Also among those whose computer systems may have been compromised is Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Florida Democrat who was previously the target of a disastrous email hack when she served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 campaign.The brothers are suspected of serious violations, including accessing members  computer networks without their knowledge and stealing equipment from Congress.Jamal handled IT for Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat who serves on both the intelligence and foreign affairs panels. As of 2/2, his employment with our office has been terminated,  Castro spokeswoman Erin Hatch told TheDCNF Friday.Jamal also worked for Louisiana Democrat Rep. Cedric Richmond, who is on the Committee on Homeland Security.Imran worked for Reps. Andre Carson, an Indiana Democrat, and Jackie Speier, a California Democrat. Both are members of the intelligence committee, and their spokesmen did not respond to TheDCNF s requests for comment. Imran also worked for the House office of Wasserman Schultz.Then-Rep. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, employed Abid for IT work in 2016. She was a member of House committees dealing with the armed services, oversight, and Benghazi. Duckworth was elected to the Senate in November, 2016. Abid has a prior criminal record and a bankruptcy.Read more: Daily Caller",Government News,"Aug 1, 2017",1
 Trump’s Education Secretary Gets ROASTED After Saying Guns In Schools Will Prevent Bear Attacks (TWEETS/VIDEO),"Our children are at risk, people! Fortunately, there is one woman who is willing to take a brave stand and confront this danger head-on   Trump education secretary pick Betsy DeVos. On Tuesday, supergenius DeVos was asked a very simple question: Do you think guns have any place in or around schools? Now, most of us would have answered that question with a simple  no,  but not DeVos. She sees a danger the rest of us are missing: bears.But never fear! Trump would never appoint someone who is completely unqualified to any position. Sure, she doesn t know that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is a thing, but  DeVos has the perfect answer to this hidden and severe threat against our children   a whole bunch of motherf*cking guns.DeVos says the decision to allow guns in schools is best left to locales and states to decide  because bear attacks are apparently a thing, and we wouldn t want students undefended while Yogi searches their school for a pic-a-nic basket, would we? I will refer back to Senator Enzi and the school he was talking about in Wyoming,  DeVos said.  I would imagine that there is probably a gun in the schools to protect from potential grizzlies.  As it turns out, Wyoming schools do not keep a pile of guns around to deal with an ever-looming threat of bear attacks.UPDATE: Teacher at Wyoming school Betsy DeVos said needed guns to shoot ""grizzlies"" says that's ""absolutely"" untruehttps://t.co/dWneudD0Tf pic.twitter.com/oVb8kEdAgL  Tom McKay (@thetomzone) January 18, 2017But, hey, at least the folks on Twitter are having fun:Screenshot from the National Geographic special Betsy DeVos watched to prove grizzly bears are a threat to schools  pic.twitter.com/c3ATfOdMJy  Guy Fi-hairy (@ih8_mayo) January 18, 2017Betsy DeVos took @StephenAtHome very literally. #GrizzlyBears #DeVosHearing pic.twitter.com/OKpsE3UQNk  FooseBallsOFire (@FooseBallsOFire) January 18, 2017We can't tell you how many times in the past year we've had a lockdown because  #grizzlybears. ? #NotMySOE #StopDeVos #DeVosHearing  Wa Badass Teachers A (@WaBATs_) January 18, 2017Maybe grizzly bears can home school your kids.

Xi urges BRICS grouping to push for more 'just' international order,"XIAMEN, China (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday urged BRICS nations to deepen coordination on global matters, and push for a more  just  world order, by boosting representation for emerging and developing countries in international bodies.  Reiterating that emerging and developing markets have been the primary engine of global growth, Xi called for a bigger role for BRICS in speeding economic governance reforms and promoting trade, especially as rising risks veil a global recovery.  BRICS countries should push for a more just and reasonable international order,  Xi told a summit of the grouping, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.  We should work together to address global challenges.  In his closing remarks, Xi urged the grouping to battle for more  representation power  for emerging and developing countries, which some analysts say are often under-represented in global institutions such as the World Bank, by comparison with the dominance of the United States and Western Europe.  The summit in the southeastern city of Xiamen has given host China its latest chance to position itself as a bulwark of globalization in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump s  America First  agenda. Xi appeared to rebuke the United States s resistance to international pacts - including the Paris climate accord - in a separate speech earlier on Tuesday to leaders of BRICS and other developing countries.    Multilateral trade negotiations make progress only with great difficulty and the implementation of the Paris Agreement has met with resistance,  Xi said.   Some countries have become more inward-looking, and their desire to participate in global development cooperation has decreased.   In talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Trump has sought improved terms for the United States, under threat of leaving the pact, and has said he will withdraw his country from the Paris climate accord. Xi gave $500 million for a South-South cooperation fund to help other developing countries tackle famine, refugees, climate change and public health challenges, besides an earlier $80-million summit pledge to support BRICS cooperation. Egypt, Guinea, Tajikistan, Thailand and Mexico joined the three-day summit as observer nations, and Xi called for a  BRICS Plus  plan to potentially expand the bloc, although no new member has been formally announced. Xi lauded smooth progress in the grouping s cooperation in areas such as anti-terrorism and internet security.  Leaders from the BRICS countries are determined to work toward another  golden decade ,  he added.   ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",0
"Czech election websites hacked, vote unaffected -Statistics Office","PRAGUE (Reuters) - The websites used for presentation of the Czech Republic s election results were hacked on Saturday afternoon, the Czech Statistical Office (CSU) said on Sunday, adding that the vote count was not affected. Czechs voted on Friday and Saturday in the parliamentary election, with the results then shown on two websites that CSU maintains with an outside provider.  During the processing (of the vote), there was a targeted DDoS attack aimed at the infrastructure of the O2 company used for elections,  CSU said on its website.      As a result, servers volby.cz and volbyhned.cz had been temporarily partly inaccessible. The attack did not in any way affect either the infrastructure used for the transmission of election results to the CSU headquarters or the independent data processing.  The anti-establishment ANO party won 29.6 percent of the vote but may struggle to find coalition partners. Many parties expressed reluctance or rejected outright any coalition with the ANO while its billionaire founder and leader Andrej Babis fights off fraud charges. Czech President Milos Zeman said on Sunday that he would name Andrej Babis prime minister.  In the last similar case, in January, the Czech Foreign Ministry said that hackers had breached dozens of its email accounts in an attack resembling one against the U.S. Democratic Party that the former Obama administration blamed on Russia. On the European Union level, the threat of cyber attacks has been taken more seriously in recent months after hacking attempts detected by some of the 28 member states. EU defense ministers tested their ability to respond to a potential hacking attack in their first cyber war games in September. The exercise was based on a simulated attack on one of the bloc s military missions abroad. ",worldnews,"October 22, 2017 ",0
 Hillary Gives HUGE Middle Finger To GOP Bigots With Surprise Showing In NYC Pride Parade,"While Donald the Trump is busy making the rounds decrying immigration, Hillary Clinton decided to make a surprise appearance in New York City for Pride. She joined NYC mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo on the parade route near the Stonewall Inn   an especially fitting show of solidarity and support following the Orlando massacre.Hillary has worked hard on reaching out to the LGBT community, and right now, they need it more than ever. The entire community was rocked to its core by the Orlando massacre, and how they feel right now is evident in Pride celebrations that are more subdued than usual.Some have avoided Pride altogether out of fear. Others have refused to engage anybody that might show the slightest hint that they re bigoted towards the LGBT community. Make no mistake, Orlando was a direct attack on their community and they have every reason to be terrified right now.Where are the Republicans who decried Orlando? Oh, right, twiddling their thumbs, shaking their heads, and making empty gestures so they don t piss off their evangelical base. Paul Ryan said that authorities knew Omar Mateen had specifically targeted the LGBT community. Then he gave the LGBT community a big  fuck you  when he introduced a rule that the House wouldn t vote on any measure giving workplace protections to LGBT employees of federal contractors.Marco Rubio pretended to mourn the massacre while saying that it can make people think harder about where they can best serve their countries. It s not likely he s talking about military service, and that was a ridiculous way of saying he ll continue to work on behalf of the hate-filled evangelicals from which the horror of Orlando came.And then there s good ol  Ted Cruz. He tried to use Orlando to convince people that it s really the Democrats who are responsible for the deaths of millions of LGBT people all over the world. So why isn t he marching in Pride parades, then? He should if he really wants to make the point that it s not his side of things that caused this.Trump himself once thanked the LGBT community and claimed nobody would be better for them than him, because he ll allegedly fight for their freedoms while Hillary wants to take them away. However, he s also said he d never appoint justices to the Supreme Court who would support marriage equality, and wants people who would give serious thought to overturning Obergefell v. Hodge. Since when is taking a right away from a specific group of people the same as fighting for their freedom?Hillary supports full equality and isn t afraid to say so. She s also unafraid to show up at a major Pride event to show her support. She didn t let the organizers know about her plans because monkey wrenches of all sorts had already been thrown into the works for so many Pride celebrations, thanks to Orlando, so it wasn t totally a surprise. However, some of her campaign volunteers said that she had been planning this for weeks. She would have appeared to show support and solidarity even if Orlando hadn t happened. The GOP? We hear crickets from them, if not outright discriminatory statements.Featured image by Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"June 26, 2016",1
 Democrats Literally Scream ‘Shame’ At Republicans For Blocking LGBT Amendment (VIDEO),"House Democrats did something extraordinary today: they broke parliamentary procedure on the House floor and literally shamed Republicans after they blocked an important LGBT amendment from passing.Now this should come as no surprise. Republicans have always been hostile towards LGBT rights, and Democrats have been fighting them on the issue for decades. So what changed this time?Well, for starters, the amendment originally was slated to pass, with 218 members voting YEA, with more than 30 Republicans crossing the aisle to join every Democrat. The bill would have barred federal contractors from obtaining government work if they were found to discriminate against anyone in the LGBT community. This is something that has enjoyed broad bipartisan support for years.And it looked as though it was going to pass, and the issue could be a thing of the past.But then the TV voting monitor posted on C-SPAN showed that some of the votes from the Republicans were rescinded. The amendment narrowly failed 212-213. Republicans successfully convinced some of their colleagues to take the pandering cowards  way out and turn their backs on those in the LGBT community, thus giving the green light for federal discrimination.Democrats, rightfully so, didn t like that. After thunderous boos from every Democratic member, they decided to publicly shame the Republican cowards by literally chanting  shame  while pointing their fingers at them from across the aisle.When the chair said  There will be order,  Democratic Rep. Gwen Moore shouted back,  No there will not be. Democrats then set out a witch hunt to figure out who changed their votes. They were:Their offices haven t commented, so there is no telling as to why they changed their vote, who convinced them, and their reasoning for doing so. But if keeping to their history of being bigots, that s all the reason they need   to be bigots.Watch House Democrats put Republicans in their place: Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"May 19, 2016",1

"Gorbachev, last Soviet leader, wants Trump-Putin summit to save arms pact","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, said on Thursday a landmark arms control treaty that helped end the Cold War was in peril and called for a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to save it.   Gorbachev, 86, said U.S.-Russia relations were in the throes of a  severe crisis  and that the treaty, which banned all Soviet and American short and intermediate-range land-based nuclear and conventional missiles, was now at serious risk. Gorbachev signed the pact - the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty - in 1987 along with then U.S. President Ronald Reagan in Washington. Russia, after the 1991 Soviet collapse, took on its obligations. Both sides have accused each other of violating the treaty in recent months however, stoking fears it might break down as U.S.-Russia ties continue to deteriorate amid allegations that Moscow interfered with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, something Russia flatly denies. Gorbachev, writing in government newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta, said the INF treaty was in danger and that Trump and Putin needed to meet and discuss the problems of nuclear disarmament and strategic stability.  It has turned out to be the most vulnerable link in the system of limiting and reducing weapons of mass destruction,  Gorbachev wrote of the landmark treaty.  If the system of curbing nuclear arms crumbles, and that is exactly what the collapse of the INF treaty can lead to, the consequences will be catastrophic.  The INF treaty required the United States and the Soviet Union to eliminate and forego all nuclear ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 Km, eliminating an entire category of weapon. Appealing to Trump and Putin, Gorbachev said he wanted to see a  fully-fledged  U.S.-Russia summit of the kind he took part in toward the end of the Cold War.  It s totally abnormal for the presidents of nuclear powers to meet somewhere  on the sidelines  (of an event) and that they have only met once,  Gorbachev wrote, referring to a meeting between Trump and Putin at the G-20 summit in Germany in July.      If the INF treaty could be saved, it would be a powerful signal for the whole world that the biggest nuclear powers understand their responsibility and take their obligations seriously,  wrote Gorbachev.

The Ferguson play will, no doubt, force viewers to question how much of what the media feeds them is real, and how much is propaganda that feeds their leftist agenda.  What is FERGUSON?FERGUSON is a staged reenactment of the controversial killing of Michael Brown using ONLY Grand Jury testimony. No spin. No media filter. Just the truth. Nine cast members of the staged reading in Los Angeles walked out before opening night because of their desire to rewrite the script. But you can t rewrite the truth; you can t rewrite history. See for yourself!LA Weekly called the staged reading of FERGUSON  a riveting spectacle  and  an incendiary evening of theatre.  This is the World Premiere of a full production.FERGUSON is a Verbatim Play   it only uses actual Grand Jury testimony from eyewitnesses who saw police officer Daren Wilson shoot, Michael Brown. Most of these eyewitnesses are minorities and yet their accounts are totally at odds with the stories spun by the mainstream media and activists.As guests at the opening of the thought-provoking Ferguson-the play began to exit the theater, Phelim approached a random woman to get her reaction to the performance. The woman he questioned seemed confused and angry by what she just witnessed. She admits she was a Black Lives Matter supporter, and even protested with Black Lives Matter to help them to push the  hands up, don t shoot  narrative. After realizing that she had been lied to by the media, she asks Phelim,  Why did I demonstrate  Hands in the air Don t shoot ? The controversial play opened last night in New York City and is set to run through November 5th.Phelim McAleer is asking for help to fund his FERGUSON production.

 Megyn Kelly Unveils DAMNING Truth Bomb About Trump’s Amazingly Hypocritical Campaign Performance,"Prior to the election, one of the things that Trump kept harping on was how the DNC gave Hillary debate questions in advance. He claimed to have solid evidence of that, and so did conspiracy sites that purported to be able to see what Hillary was staring at on her podium for one of the debates. It seems, though, that Trump s gripe was less-than legitimate   even more so than most of his gripes throughout the campaign.This kind of thing is only a problem if it could hurt him. When it benefits him, everyone should have at. But we knew that. What many probably didn t know is that the accusations he insisted on lobbing during the final stretch up to the disastrous Nov. 8 election were incredibly, amazingly, astonishingly, astoundingly hypocritical.Megyn Kelly s new book, Settle For More, details out a lot of what Trump did to her during the primaries. But that s not all. The New York Times  review of her book says: The day before the first presidential debate, Mr. Trump was in a lather again, Ms. Kelly writes. He called Fox executives, saying he d heard that her first question  was a very pointed question directed at him.  This disconcerted her, because it was true: It was about his history of using disparaging language about women. The day before.  Now how did he know what Kelly was going to ask, we wonder? Could it be that someone at Fox leaked the debate questions to him? There s no other way for him to know that.Throughout the last 17 months, the accusations Trump leveled at his enemies were things he himself was guilty of. Following the third general election debate, he was adamant about exposing alleged treachery on the part of the DNC and Hillary. His claim was that she d gotten the debate questions in advance, while he was kept in the dark. We have to ask Trump,  Project, much?  Then again, projection is what he does.But that s not all   Settle For More also contains this tidbit: On the day of the debate, Ms. Kelly writes, she woke up feeling great. Then an overzealous, suspiciously enthusiastic driver picked her up to take her to the convention center. He insisted on getting her coffee, though she d repeatedly declined his offer. Once it was in her hand, she drank it. And within 15 minutes, she was violently ill, vomiting so uncontrollably that it was unclear if she d be able to go on and help moderate that evening. It was so bad that she kept a trash pail beneath her desk throughout the debate, just in case. Was Trump trying to poison her in advance of the debate? She doesn t say, and The New York Times wisely leaves that up to the reader to determine. Regardless, it s suspicious and entirely typical of a man like Trump   he will stop at nothing to get revenge on his enemies. And the Electoral College will put this man in the White House.Photo of Megyn Kelly by Neilson Barnard via Getty Images for Hollywood Reporter.

Trump's offer to Russia: an end to sanctions for nuclear arms cut - London Times,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will propose offering to end sanctions imposed on Russia over its annexation of Crimea in return for a nuclear arms reduction deal with Moscow, he told The Times of London. Criticizing previous U.S. foreign policy in an interview published on Monday, he described the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 as possibly the gravest error in the history of the United States and akin to “throwing rocks into a beehive”. But Trump, who will be inaugurated on Friday as the 45th U.S. president, raised the prospect of the first big nuclear arms control agreement with Moscow since the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty signed by President Barack Obama in 2010. “They have sanctions on Russia — let’s see if we can make some good deals with Russia,” the Republican president-elect was quoted as saying by The Times. “For one thing, I think nuclear weapons should be way down and reduced very substantially, that’s part of it. But Russia’s hurting very badly right now because of sanctions, but I think something can happen that a lot of people are gonna benefit.” The United States and Russia are by far the world’s biggest nuclear powers. The United States has 1,367 nuclear warheads on deployed strategic missiles and bombers, and Russia has 1,796 such deployed warheads, according to the latest published assessment by the U.S. State Department. Under the 2010 New START treaty, Russia and the United States agreed to limit the number of long-range, strategic nuclear weapons they can deploy.  Trump has said he will seek to improve relations with Moscow despite criticism that he is too eager to make an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.  The United States and other Western powers imposed sanctions on Russia in 2014 over its annexation of the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine and its support for pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine.  Asked whether he would trust German Chancellor Angela Merkel or Putin more, Trump said: “Well, I start off trusting both —but let’s see how long that lasts. It may not last long at all.” His relations with Moscow have faced renewed scrutiny after an unsubstantiated report that Russia had collected compromising information about Trump. The information was summarized in a U.S. intelligence report which was presented to Trump and Obama this month. The report concluded Russia tried to sway the outcome of the Nov. 8 election in Trump’s favor by hacking and other means. It did not make an assessment on whether Russia’s attempts affected the election’s outcome. Trump accused U.S. intelligence agencies of leaking the  information from the unverified dossier, which he called “fake news” and phony stuff.” Intelligence leaders denied the charge and Moscow has dismissed the accusations against it. In the interview with The Times, Trump was also critical of Russia’s intervention in Syria’s civil war which, along with the help of Iran, has tilted the conflict in President Bashar al-Assad’s favor. “I think it’s a very rough thing,” Trump said of Russian intervention in Syria. “Aleppo has been such a terrible humanitarian situation.” The war has killed more than 300,000 people, created the world’s worst refugee crisis and aided the rise of the Islamic State militant group. On NATO, Trump repeated his view that the military alliance was obsolete but said it was still very important for him. “I took such heat, when I said NATO was obsolete,” Trump told The Times, referring to comments he made during his presidential election campaign. “It’s obsolete because it wasn’t taking care of terror. I took a lot of heat for two days. And then they started saying Trump is right.” Trump said many NATO member states were not paying their fair share for U.S. protection. “A lot of these countries aren’t paying what they’re supposed to be paying, which I think is very unfair to the United States,” Trump said. “With that being said, NATO is very important to me. There’s five countries that are paying what they’re supposed to. Five. It’s not much.” Trump said he would appoint his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to try to broker a Middle East peace deal, urged Britain to veto any new U.N. Security Council resolution critical of Israel and criticized Obama’s handling of the deal between Iran and six  world powers including the United States which curbed Tehran’s nuclear program.  On Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, Trump said: “Brexit is going to end up being a great thing” and said he was eager to get a trade deal done with the United Kingdom.

 Libertarian Candidate Strips On Stage During Convention (VIDEO),"This weekend, the Libertarian Party held its annual convention in Orlando, Florida. On Sunday, as ballots were being counted to determine who would be the party s presidential and vice-presidential nominees, candidates vying for party chairman were each allowed two minutes to speak.During this time, James Weeks, a candidate for the chairman position, took to the stage. Instead of using his two minutes to urge party members to vote for him, he instead used his time to do a striptease.Reporters who were covering the convention tweeted out photos and video of the candidate s performance.The Washington Post s Dave Weigel tweeted:Image credit: Screen capture via Dave Weigel on TwitterAt around the same time, Byron Tau of the Wall Street Journal posted this image to Twitter.Image credit: Byron Tau via TwitterMeanwhile, Vaughn Hillyard of NBC News wondered how C-SPAN was dealing with the spontaneous striptease.Image credit: Vaughn Hillyard via TwitterC-SPAN aired the candidate s performance live.Video of the C-SPAN coverage, which identifies the candidate as James Weeks, was quickly posted to YouTube. At the end of the performance, Weeks told the audience that  it was a dare,  and announcing that he was going to  go ahead and drop out.

U.S. judicial panel finds Texas hurt Latino vote with redrawn boundaries,"SAN ANTONIO, Texas (Reuters) - A special federal judicial panel ruled for the second time in two months on Thursday that the Republican-led Texas Legislature deliberately redrew political boundaries so as to unfairly diminish voter clout of the state’s growing Latino population. A divided three-judge panel found that the boundaries of several state legislative districts were reshaped with the intention of illegally diluting the strength of the Democratic-leaning Hispanic electorate for the benefit of the Republican Party. The panel ruled that the redrawn boundaries were designed to either fragment cohesive Latino communities among multiple districts, or to lump Hispanics into a single jurisdiction and thus limit their overall sway. Similar gerrymandering tactics of “cracking” and “packing” were found last month by the same panel in redrawn boundaries for three of the state’s 36 congressional districts. It was not immediately clear whether Texas would appeal the latest decision, which pertained to state legislative districts encompassing some of the state’s largest cities, including Dallas, San Antonio and Houston. As in last month’s 2-1 decision, Thursday’s ruling was agreed upon by U.S. District Judges Xavier Rodriguez and Orlando Garcia of San Antonio, appointees of former Republican President George W. Bush and former Democratic President Bill Clinton, respectively.  The third member of the panel, 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Jerry Smith, appointed by former Republican President Ronald Reagan, dissented in both opinions.  He blasted the latest decision as “clearly erroneous,” writing that partisan advantage, not race itself, was the rationale for drawing the districts as they were.  Generally courts have ruled that shaping districts based on race or ethnicity is illegal, but drawing boundaries to gain political advantage for the majority party is not.  Texas Democratic Party chair Gilberto Hinojosa welcomed the findings of Thursday’s 153-page majority opinion. “The Republicans have dealt Texas a deep moral wound,” he said. “They haven’t just been cheating to gain an edge in the political game. They have been deliberately holding back Texans from having a voice in their own government.” Republicans have dominated all statewide non judicial offices in Texas for more than 20 years, and have frequently used that advantage to redraw political maps to benefit their  party.

RABID PRO-AMNESTY LEGISLATOR Luis Gutiérrez On Paul Ryan For Speaker “He would work with Democrats in order to solve the problems of America” [VIDEO],"When you re a Republican and get a ringing endorsement from radical pro-amnesty carnival barker, Luis Guti rrez  you should probably re-think your party affiliation Friday on MSNBC, Rep. Luis Guti rrez (D-IL) said Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI)doesn t want to be House Speaker because he would have to work with the  extreme  Republicans who want to take away the rights of gays, woman and minorities.Guti rrez said,  Look, they cannibalize their own. First Cantor, then McCarthy, before that Boehner. That s why Paul Ryan doesn t want to be the Speaker of the House. He doesn t want to be the Speaker of the House because he understands that there are 35, 40 Republican members of the House that didn t come here to govern. They came here to destroy government. They came here to take the government down. They don t want to coalesce and work with the other side of the aisle. They want to take the country backwards. He continued,  Yesterday I was at a hearing, the judiciary committee. What do they want to do now they have a new committee and a new investigation into Planned Parenthood. Why? Because they want to turn the clock back on women. They want women to go back to the  50s and that  Mad Men  series that we watch on cable TV where women didn t have rights. That s what they want to do, and that s why he doesn t want to take on the Speakership. They want to turn the clock back, and they have chaos. Look, if they can t do something as fundamental as pick a new leader, as fundamental as pick a new leader, and every time they pick a leader, they cannibalize that leader. How are they going to lead this nation? Complementing Ryan he continued,  Let me just say this. smartest person, I believe, in the GOP conference and would be good for the country, would be good for the Republican Party, would be good for the House of Representatives   because Paul Ryan is the kind of individual that will work with other people on the other side of the aisle, and I think that that s what need. He added,  He would work with Democrats in order to solve the problems of America and that s exactly what the 35, 40 members, these extreme members, very vocal, organized, extreme members of the Republican caucus don t want. They don t want an American solution. They think, you know what, gay people should go back in the closet, women should be at home in the kitchen, and those Latinos and Asians, why don t we just make them invisible again or deport them altogether? That s their philosophy of government. They want to go back before there was a Voting Rights and a Civil Rights Act in America. When I was born in America in 1953, it was separate but equal. But let me assure you, it was separate but not real equal for people like me. That s the America they want to take us back to. and guess what? the vast majority of the American people are going to push back strong against that attempt to take us backwards.

JUDICIAL BIAS? LATINA SUPREME COURT JUSTICE Declares Her Shockingly Racist View On Ethnicity And Sex When Judging," I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn t lived that life    Supreme Court Justice SotomayorAs the main stream media does a hit job on Donald Trump for expressing his view that the presiding judge in the Trump University case is biased against him because of Trump s views on immigration, we have a RACIST Latina Supreme Court Justice who s openly declaring that the ethnicity and sex of a judge makes a difference in their judging! So which is it?  The left wants to have it both ways but they re being outed as total hypocrites! Unreal! Judge Sotomayor questioned whether achieving impartiality  is possible in all, or even, in most, cases.  She added,  And I wonder whether by ignoring our differences as women or men of color we do a disservice both to the law and society. AND THEY RE CALLING TRUMP A RACIST?WASHINGTON   In 2001, Sonia Sotomayor, an appeals court judge, gave a speech declaring that the ethnicity and sex of a judge  may and will make a difference in our judging. In her speech, Judge Sotomayor questioned the famous notion   often invoked by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her retired Supreme Court colleague, Sandra Day O Connor   that a wise old man and a wise old woman would reach the same conclusion when deciding cases. I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn t lived that life,  said Judge Sotomayor, who is now considered to be near the top of President Obama s list of potential Supreme Court nominees.Her remarks, at the annual Judge Mario G. Olmos Law and Cultural Diversity Lecture at the University of California, Berkeley, were not the only instance in which she has publicly described her view of judging in terms that could provoke sharp questioning in a confirmation hearing.This month, for example, a video surfaced of Judge Sotomayor asserting in 2005 that a  court of appeals is where policy is made.  She then immediately adds:  And I know   I know this is on tape, and I should never say that because we don t make law. I know. O.K. I know. I m not promoting it. I m not advocating it. I m   you know. The video was of a panel discussion for law students interested in becoming clerks, and she was explaining the different experiences gained when working at district courts and appeals courts. Her remarks caught the eye of conservative bloggers who accused her of being a  judicial activist,  although Jonathan H. Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve University law school, argued that critics were reading far too much into those remarks.Republicans have signaled that they intend to put the eventual nominee under a microscope, and they say they were put on guard by Mr. Obama s statement that judges should have  empathy,  a word they suggest could be code for injecting liberal ideology into the law.Judge Sotomayor has given several speeches about the importance of diversity. But her 2001 remarks at Berkeley, which were published by the Berkeley La Raza Law Journal, went further, asserting that judges  identities will affect legal outcomes. Whether born from experience or inherent physiological or cultural differences,  she said, for jurists who are women and nonwhite,  our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging. Her remarks came in the context of reflecting her own life experiences as a Hispanic female judge and on how the increasing diversity on the federal bench  will have an effect on the development of the law and on judging. In making her argument, Judge Sotomayor sounded many cautionary notes. She said there was no uniform perspective that all women or members of a minority group have, and emphasized that she was not talking about any individual case.She also noted that the Supreme Court was uniformly white and male when it delivered historic rulings against racial and sexual discrimination. And she said she tried to question her own  opinions, sympathies and prejudices,  and aspired to impartiality.Still, Judge Sotomayor questioned whether achieving impartiality  is possible in all, or even, in most, cases.  She added,  And I wonder whether by ignoring our differences as women or men of color we do a disservice both to the law and society. Read more: NYT ",Government News,"Jun 7, 2016",1
Democrats ask Trump to veto measure repealing city retirement plan rule,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a last-ditch effort, five U.S. Senate Democrats are urging President Donald Trump to veto a resolution that would repeal a Labor Department rule designed to help cities launch retirement savings plans for low-income private-sector workers by exempting such programs from strict federal pension protection laws. In an April 5 letter that Reuters saw on Thursday, the lawmakers told Trump, a Republican, that killing the rule could harm more than 2 million Americans who would otherwise benefit from city-run retirement plans. “We ask you to work with us to increase access to retirement savings programs and promote greater retirement security,” they wrote. The senators signing the letter are Patty Murray of Washington and Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrats on committees overseeing pensions and tax matters; Maria Cantwell of Washington; Kirsten Gillibrand of New York; and Robert Casey of Pennsylvania. The resolution on city-run retirement plans is one of 13 measures that Congress has passed to repeal rules enacted under previous president Barack Obama, a Democrat. An obscure law called the Congressional Review Act gives Congress a tool to repeal regulations that it finds objectionable. All that is required is a simple majority vote in both chambers and the president’s signature. The law is limited, however, in how it can be used. Only rules that were finalized within 60 legislative days are eligible for repeal. Trump has signed 11 of the 13 resolutions so far.  The White House Office of Management and Budget has advised Trump to sign the city-run retirement plan measure, and a White House official said on Wednesday that the president would sign more resolutions this month.  The Labor Department adopted two rules at the end of Obama’s tenure that exempted both city and state-run retirement plans from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, a law designed to protect workers’ savings. The plans are geared toward private-sector workers whose employers do not offer 401(k) or other retirement benefits, and would let them enroll automatically in plans like those being introduced in places like California. Cities and states say they need the exemption for the plans to work effectively, but trade groups like the Chamber of Commerce and Investment Company Institute want it repealed amid concerns that workers would not have adequate pension protections. The resolution to repeal the city-run retirement plan rule narrowly passed the Senate in a 50-49 vote.  The Senate is expected to take up a separate resolution to repeal the rule on state-run retirement plans after the Easter recess. ",politicsNews,"April 6, 2017 ",0
"Trump says open to bilateral Canada, Mexico pacts if NAFTA talks fail","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he was open to bilateral trade pacts with either Canada or Mexico if a three-way deal cannot be reached to substantially revise the North American Free Trade Agreement.  Asked by a reporter if he could envision maintaining free trade with Canada if NAFTA talks sour with Mexico, Trump said: “Oh sure, absolutely. It’s possible we won’t be able to reach a deal with one or the other, but in the meantime we’ll make a deal with one.” Trump added that a “very creative” deal was still possible to benefit all three countries. Trump’s comments came at a White House meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was in Washington to promote NAFTA’s benefits as a new round of renegotiations began near Washington. Asked about Trump’s comments at a news conference later, Trudeau said he was still optimistic about the chances of modernizing the 1994 trade pact. “I continue to believe in NAFTA ... so saying, we are ready for anything, and we will continue to work diligently to protect Canadian interests,” Trudeau said. Trudeau added that Canada was “very much aware of and very braced for” Trump’s unpredictability, but his government would work in a “thoughtful, meaningful way towards getting a good deal.” Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo, speaking on Mexican radio, praised Trump’s comments as “very balanced” to include the possibility of a deal with either country and hold out hope for a creative solution. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday accused Trump’s administration of trying to sabotage the talks with “poison pill proposals,” including demands for more favorable treatment for the U.S. side on car production, and a “sunset clause” to force regular negotiations. In his appearance with Trudeau, Trump said: “We’ll see what happens” when asked whether NAFTA was doomed. “It’s possible we won’t be able to make a deal, and it’s possible that we will,” he said. “We’ll see if we can do the kind of changes that we need. We have to protect our workers, and in all fairness, the prime minister wants to protect Canada and his people also.” U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, one of Trump’s top trade advisers, downplayed the chances that a NAFTA termination would become necessary. “We don’t hope it will, we don’t desire that it will, we don’t believe that it will, but it is at least a conceptual possibility as we go forward,” Ross said. But U.S. and Mexican corporate chief executives gathered in Mexico City said they would be better off with no NAFTA than be saddled with a “bad agreement.”    Trade experts said the NAFTA talks were likely to stall in the face of aggressive U.S. attempts to sharply increase content requirements for autos and auto parts.  People briefed on U.S. proposals to be presented this week said Washington was seeking to sharply lift North American content threshold in car manufacturing. The proposals call for North American content overall to rise to 85 percent from the current 62.5 percent. In addition, the United States wants to add a new 50 percent U.S.-specific content requirement, something that was not in the earlier agreements. “These will be met with widespread opposition from Canada and Mexico. I think it’s just a bridge too far,” said Wendy Cutler, the Asia Society’s Washington policy director and former chief U.S. negotiator for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal canceled by Trump.      The U.S. side sees strengthening the rules of origin for the auto industry as a way to bring back some auto parts production, including electronics, from Asia. But Mexico strongly opposes a U.S.-specific content requirement, which would limit the growth of its own car industry.   The difficult issue of rules of origin will be addressed mostly at the end of the current talks, according to a schedule obtained by Reuters. The negotiations were extended on Wednesday by two days to Oct 17.  Other U.S. proposals opposed by Canada, Mexico and U.S. business interests include the five-year sunset provision, radical changes to NAFTA’s dispute arbitration systems, changes to intellectual property provisions and new protections for U.S. seasonal produce growers. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday the three nations had completed their negotiations on company competition policy, reaching an agreement that goes beyond previous U.S. trade deals to ensure “certain rights and transparency under each nation’s competition laws.”  ",politicsNews,"October 11, 2017 ",0
" ‘Lie After Lie After Lie’: Fox’s Shep Smith Breaks Ranks, Goes Nuclear On Team Trump (VIDEO)","As the Russia stories surrounding the criminal enterprise known as the Trump Administration continue to pile up, journalists all over network television are demanding answers. However, those journalists are usually not employees of Fox News. For many years, that particular network has generally been nothing more than a propaganda arm for the Christian Right and the most extreme elements of the Republican Party. However, there is one Fox journalist who has gone rogue: Shepard Smith.Now, Smith has been known to buck against the more ridiculous or downright lying elements of his network before. That has included being openly critical of the Trump Administration when most folks there are walking the party line. He s really taken things much further in that direction now, though, since the recent revelations regarding Trump s mini me s attempts to get dirt on Hillary Clinton from the Russians during the 2016 election season. Speaking with fellow more-reasonable-than-most Fox host Chris Wallace on Friday, Shep Smith went nuclear. Here is the transcript of that exchange from the Washington Post, which has called the diatribe Smith s  Cronkite moment : We re still not clean on this, Chris [Wallace]. If there s nothing there   and that s what they tell us, they tell us there s nothing to this and nothing came of it, there s a nothingburger, it wasn t even memorable, didn t write it down, didn t tell you about it, because it wasn t anything so I didn t even remember it   with a Russian interpreter in the room at Trump Tower? If all of that, why all these lies? Why is it lie after lie after lie? If you clean, come on clean, you know? My grandmother used to say when first we practice to   Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive. The deception, Chris, is mind-boggling. And there are still people who are out there who believe we re making it up. And one day they re gonna realize we re not and look around and go, Where are we, and why are we getting told all these lies? This is amazing, considering the culture over at Fox. Don t fall in lockstep? You re probably risking your job. Further, since Fox and their constant lies, spin, bigotry, misogyny, and all manner of distastefulness is so toxic to the other, more credible networks, a person might have a difficult time finding journalistic employment elsewhere. Given all of that, this was an amazingly courageous thing to do.Thank you for bringing real news to America s most deceitful network, Mr. Smith. Hats off to you, and keep it up. Perhaps CNN or   dare I say it   MSNBC will give you a shot should Fox heed the calls from deluded Trumpkins to fire you. MSNBC is my favorite network, and I d definitely tune in.Watch this amazing moment below:Shep Smith:  The deception, Chris, is mind-boggling why are we getting told all these lies?

 Early Voting In North Carolina Shows GREAT NEWS For Democrats,"Early voting has begun in the battleground state of North Carolina, and after months of contentious litigation, it s clear why Republicans wanted to squash it: returns are showing Democrats with an eight point advantage over Republicans.Data analysis from TargetSmart (who partnered with NBC News) shows that of the 4,000 plus presidential ballots that have been cast, 42 percent come from registered Democrats, 34 percent from Republicans, 25 percent from unaffiliated, and 1 percent from Libertarians.Contrast that to 2012, when Mitt Romney won North Carolina by two percent: in early voting that year in that state, Republicans held a five percent lead. Now Democrats hold an eight percent lead. In 2008, when President Obama won (by a slim margin of 0.33 percent), Democrats had an 11 point advantage. In 2004, Democrats had an 11 point advantage, but Kerry lost to Bush by 13 percent.So while it s not set in stone that whoever accumulates the most early votes wins, the last two elections (in which early voting has increased tremendously) shows that is the case.Nate Silver s FiveThirtyEight currently gives Clinton a 43 percent chance of winning North Carolina (and a 62 percent chance of winning the election overall). Clinton s chances have gone up almost five percent in the last week, with one reason being a strong showing for Democrats in early voting. The New York Times  election model gives Clinton a 48 percent chance of winning North Carolina.Again, no wonder Governor Pat McCory, who is currently losing his re-election bid, and the GOP legislature wanted to do away with it. When Democrats get a head start, that usually means good news in November.Democrats shouldn t get too comfortable. Although early voting points to a Democratic-leaning result, Republicans could very well (and chances are great) benefit from in person voting on November 8. President Obama never overcame Romney in the polls in the weeks leading up to the election, almost all the polls for the month of September favored Obama.With 45 days left until the election, anything can happen, so Democrats need to continue to mobilize, register, and get out the vote for not just early ballots, but for November 8.Rachel Maddow broke down the facts on her show:Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"September 23, 2016",1

 Rosie O’Donnell Retitles The News To More Honestly Depict Donald Trump (TWEET),"As much as he and his supporters want to say the media is against Donald Trump, it s clearly not. Trump has gotten a ridiculous amount of media attention, and it would be easy to say much more than any other candidate of either party.With this media attention comes an abundance of newspaper articles, blog posts and ledes to stories. All with their own way to describe something Trump has said or done or is being scrutinized for. Many of which are pretty straight-forward and bland, not really depicting Trump in a way that really embodies his true essence.Well, fixing this dilemma is none other than the extraordinary Rosie O Donnell who took to Twitter to retitle the news to more accurately depict Donald Trump.For example, Huffington Post titled an article,  Judge Criticized By Trump Unseals Documents In Trump University Case,  but Rosie kept it real and wrote: ORANGE PEOPLE STEAL MONEY FROM UNSUSPECTING INNOCENTS ORANGE PEOPLE STEAL MONEY FROM UNSUSPECTING INNOCENTS https://t.co/1988CJAPB4 via @HuffPostPol #DEPORTORANGEMAN  Rosie (@Rosie) May 30, 2016Which is exactly what he did. Let s not try to sugarcoat what a scam artist Donald Trump actually is. He opened a make-believe  university,  took people s money, and laughed all the way to the bank. He scammed people then like he is scamming people now when he says he ll make a good president. When in reality he d be the worst president we ve ever seen. Yes, even worse than George W. Bush. Trump has absolutely no policy experience whatsoever, foreign or domestic, and he would be an embarrassment to the entire nation if he were to represent us in the world forum.It s getting to the point where you re waiting for the big reveal, as though someone is about to come out and say,  Hey America, you re on Candid Camera,  and we can all breathe a collective sigh of relief. However, until then, kudos to Rosie O Donnell for keeping in real.Featured Photo by Andrew Toth/Getty Images for Fund for Women s Equality/ ERA Coalition",News,"May 30, 2016",1
AT&T lawyer says U.S. effort to stop Time Warner deal 'foolish': CNBC,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice’s move to block AT&T Inc’s $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc was “foolish” because the deal posed no threat to consumers, the wireless carrier’s trial lawyer Dan Petrocelli told CNBC on Tuesday. The Justice Department on Monday sued AT&T arguing that the U.S. No. 2 wireless carrier would use Time Warner’s content to force rival pay-TV companies to pay “hundreds of millions of dollars more per year for Time Warner’s networks.” AT&T has vowed to defend the deal. “We want to go to court as soon as possible,” Petrocelli told CNBC, saying the burden of proof was on the government.  The case was initially assigned on Tuesday to Judge Christopher Cooper in federal court in Washington but later reassigned to Judge Richard Leon.  The case will be closely watched because U.S. President Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of Time Warner’s CNN, and opposed AT&T’s purchase of Time Warner on the campaign trail last year, saying it would concentrate too much power in AT&T’s hands.  In antitrust circles, the court fight will be closely watched since the Justice Department has not successfully litigated to stop a vertical deal - where the merging companies are not direct competitors - since the 1970s, when it prevented Ford Motor Co from buying assets from spark-plug maker Autolite.

STREET ARTIST Censored For Painting Of Hillary Clinton In Bikini,"Censorship is alive and well when it comes to Hillary Clinton A street artist in Australia had his Instagram account deleted and now he s being told to take down the painting on the side of a building. Hillary is pictured (below) in a sort of bikini/monokini that is pretty raunchy. It s a copy of a photoshopped image that s been on the internet for years. This really is censorship of the worst kind because it s a known image. Obviously, Instagram is a Hillary fan: Speaking on Melbourne radio, Lushsux said he suspected that his Instagram account, which he said had some 110,000 followers, was deleted due to him posting a photo of the raunchy Hillary image. Melbourne (AFP)   An Australian mural of US presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in a revealing, stars and stripes swimsuit may be taken down, after it has reportedly been deemed offensive.The creator of the painting, the street artist who goes by the name Lushsux and who has also painted murals of the likes of Donald Trump and Kim Kardashian, branded calls to remove it  pathetic .The provocative mural is on the wall of a small business in the Melbourne suburb of Footscray, and reports say the business has been asked by the local Maribyrnong Council to remove it. We believe it is offensive because of the depiction of a near-naked woman, not on the basis of disrespect to Hillary Clinton, in accordance with the Graffiti Prevention Act 2007,  the council s chief executive Stephen Wall told Fairfax Media on Friday.Wall said local police had been asked to urgently provide their opinion on the mural, adding that the council intended to issue a notice to the building s owner to remove it within 10 days.Lushsux accused the council of being out of control, telling Fairfax the mural was  on par offence-wise  with a deodorant ad.Speaking on Melbourne radio, Lushsux said he suspected that his Instagram account, which he said had some 110,000 followers, was deleted due to him posting a photo of the raunchy Hillary image.

HERE’S WHY TRUMP’S Muslim Ban Is Absolutely Necessary,"The biggest thing a president can do for the people is to protect them from an enemy. If you refuse to define the enemy then you really can t fight it correctly. Obama and Hillary Clinton have both repeatedly denied that we re at war with Islam and refused to name it ISLAMIC EXTREMISM. On the other hand, Donald Trump has defined the enemy and is ready to defend Americans from it by banning Muslims until we can  figure out what s going on . Our own FBI and DHS have stated that WE CANNOT PROPERLY VET THE REFUGEES COMING TO AMERICA. Yes, you would think Obama would be cautious like Jimmy Carter and other past Presidents have and ban Muslims. Noooo .Obama is doing just the opposite! He s flooding towns across America with Muslims!A Muslim ban is necessary and needs to happen ASAP!Gen. David Petraeus is now auditioning to become Hillary Clinton s vice presidential pick. There s really no other way to interpret his recent column in The Washington Post, slamming Donald Trump for proposing a temporary ban on Muslim immigration.Calling Mr. Trump s statements  hate speech,  Gen. Petraeus essentially argues that anyone who dares to tell the truth about Islamic terrorism will only incite more Muslims to become Islamic terrorists,  by telling Muslims that the United States is at war with them and their religion. That statement assumes that the overwhelming majority of Muslims from Dearborn, Mich., to Kuala Lumpur are illiterate, stupid and blind.Practicing Muslims understand their religion far better than we do in the West. They understand that no one has  hijacked  Islam, as the apologists would have it; but that groups of Islamists, from al Qaeda to the Nusra front to the Islamic State, are seeking to apply Islamic doctrine   Shariah law   in its entirety.You can t win a war if you don t know the enemy. Our enemy today is Islamic supremacism, those who seek to establish an Islamic caliphate with the ultimate goal of replacing our Constitution with Shariah law.Rather than sweep that reality under the table, Mr. Trump has recognized that we simply have no tools at present to deal with this threat, and that the first responsibility of the president is to protect the security of Americans.Just days after the San Bernardino shootings last December, we learned that the Department of Homeland Security had shut down an intelligence-based screening program that had identified the mosque that shooter Syed Farook attended as a recruitment center for jihadis.Screening programs like the one whistleblower Phil Haney had devised are precisely what we need. We also need better screening at airports and U.S. consulates around the world. But programs like this take time to devise and put in place.Critics often mistakenly accuse Mr. Trump of imposing a permanent ban on all Muslims because of their religion. But he understands that any screening program that profiles individuals because of their religion, ethnicity or nationality will overwhelm our national security system with masses of individuals who pose no threat to us at all.A better approach is the one adopted by Israel at Ben Gurion Airport, where Israeli screeners attempt to identify actual threats by focusing on behavior and activity, not religion or ethnicity.Ever wonder why the Israeli college kids doing the screening ask you where you were staying in Israel and what you were doing? Because they know all the hotels and how far they are from just about everything. If you say you were staying in a Tel Aviv beach hotel and were visiting family in Ramallah, they probably would ask you why you didn t stay in Jerusalem, which is much closer.How did you get back in forth? Did you know a taxi driver? What was his name? If you rented a car in Tel Aviv, which check point did you drive through to get into the West Bank? Did somebody tell you to go to a particular check point? And on and on.Even good legends eventually break down. And while this intense questioning at the airport is time-consuming and often annoying, the Israelis understand that if they make a mistake, people will die.I don t know what type of system our national security establishment will ultimately propose we put in place. But until we have one, we in the United States are ill-equipped at present to distinguish between a nonpracticing Muslim, or a Muslim who does not accept the supremacist doctrines of Shariah law, and one who does.The former pose no threat and are potential allies in the war against the Islamists. The latter pose an existential threat to America and must be utterly defeated.Read more: WT",politics,"May 23, 2016",1
Turkish court remands German journalist in custody over terrorism charges,"ANKARA (Reuters) - A German journalist went on trial for terrorism charges in Turkey on Wednesday, saying she was innocent and demanding her immediate release, in a case that has damaged already sour relations with Berlin. Mesale Tolu was detained in April, accused of being a member of a terrorist organization and publishing terrorist propaganda. Her husband was also detained and their three-year-old son has been living with his mother in jail for the last five months. Tolu is one of 18 people on trial accused of membership of the MLKP, a communist party with links to armed Kurdish groups. They face up to 20 years in jail.  I have not committed any of the above mentioned crimes and have no connection with illegal organizations. I demand my release and my acquittal,  Tolu told the court in Silivri, near Istanbul, Turkish media reported.  The court ordered that Tolu and five other defendants remain in jail pending trial, while releasing eight others. The next hearing will be on Dec. 18. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel demanded her release.  We demand a fair trial, based on the rule of law. Above all, what matters now is speed so that Mesale Tolu can be released as soon as possible,  he told Bild newspaper in an interview published on Wednesday. Tolu is one of 11 German nationals detained in Turkey - among them fellow journalist Deniz Yucel and human rights campaigner Peter Steudtner.  The cases have added to strains in bilateral relations after Ankara denied German lawmakers permission to visit German soldiers serving at the Incirlik air base. In a crackdown on alleged perpetrators of an attempted coup last year, some 50,000 people been jailed pending trial.  Chancellor Angela Merkel said last month that Turkey s 12-year journey to join the European Union should be halted.     Tolu said it was unacceptable that she and her son had spent five months in jail.  Pre-trial detention has become punishment not only for me but also for my family and for my son,  she told the court. ",worldnews,"October 11, 2017 ",0
Nominee for U.S. Army secretary warns about impact of further troop cuts,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The nominee to be the next U.S. Army secretary told lawmakers on Thursday that cutting the size of the force had increased the risk to American security and that further reductions would require a rethinking of the Army’s role and priorities. Eric Fanning, a longtime senior defense official who would be the first openly gay military service secretary, told his confirmation hearing that reducing the Army to 450,000 troops by 2018 from about 490,000 currently, was manageable but would increase the risk to national security. The Pentagon is in the process of cutting almost $1 trillion in projected defense spending over a decade under a 2011 deal approved by the White House and Congress. Cutting the active-duty Army to 420,000 soldiers, which could be required if the spending cuts are not reversed, “would require a whole new set of assumptions and guidance on what the Army is supposed to do and what its priorities should be,” said Fanning, who would replace Army Secretary John McHugh, who stepped down several months ago. Republican presidential candidates have blasted the cuts, promising more military spending to confront international threats including Islamic State. Fanning would bring unique experience to the job because he has served at senior levels in all three branches of the U.S. armed forces, including stints as acting Air Force secretary and acting Army secretary. Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee were largely positive about Fanning’s nomination, although the panel waited several months to take it up, leading the administration to name him acting Army secretary. That prompted Republican Senator John McCain, chairman of the committee, to write a letter to the White House in November charging Fanning’s appointment as acting secretary was a violation of a law barring nominees from taking steps that presume they will be confirmed. While the White House disagreed, Fanning stepped down in deference to McCain’s concerns and has since been preparing for the confirmation hearing. Advocacy groups said Fanning’s nomination was a significant sign of progress in protecting the rights of gays and lesbians to serve in the world’s most powerful military. For many years, the U.S. military followed a “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy that allowed gays to serve only if they did not disclose their sexual orientation. It abolished that policy in 2011.

 Trump Would Give Ivanka SICK And DISGUSTING Advice If She Were Being Sexually Harassed At Work,"It s disgusting enough that Donald Trump jumped to serial womanizer and harsser Roger Ailes  defense in the wake of a growing sexual harassment scandal at Fox News. When asked how he d respond if his daughter, Ivanka, was being harassed the way that Ailes harassed many women, his answer was positively vile.Kirsten Powers, a Fox News contributor and USA Today columnist, pointedly asked Trump that very question. His reply? I would like to think she would find another career or find another company if that was the case. Because it should always be incumbent upon the woman to handle the situation quietly, instead of her harasser s responsibility to, oh, we don t know, maybe not harass women. Novel idea, yes? Trump literally just said he wouldn t want his daughter to report it, to complain, to fight for herself, or to out her harasser. From there, given his defense of Ailes and his own proclivity towards womanizing and harassment, we can assume that he expects her to work to avoid ruining her harasser s career and life at all costs.Just over a week ago, Trump told NBC s Chuck Todd the following: Some of the women that are complaining, I know how much he s helped them Now, all of a sudden, they re saying these horrible things about him. Piling on a bandwagon, in his opinion? Perhaps. Maybe he thinks they re jaded because Ailes passed them over for promotion, or worse, because Ailes didn t hit on them, but hit on other women in front of them and they were jealous. The mind of a misogynist can create all kinds of theories as to why women would dare ruin a career as obviously stellar as that of Roger Ailes.Most women can t just up and quit their jobs because they re being harassed. Even if they all could, they should absolutely not be expected to. Why? Because the harassment is not their fault, and it should be on their harasser to go find a new damn job. It s the harasser who was wrong.Ivanka stands by her father in his bid for the presidency, and he should not be telling her to tuck tail and run in the face of harassment, as if the harassment is her fault. That is victim-blaming at its absolute worst. He s a horrifically sick bastard for that.Featured image by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images",News,"August 1, 2016",1

U.S. courts look ahead to Trump as Obama cases fizzle,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama’s legal defense of some key initiatives including his signature healthcare law is collapsing as courts put cases on hold until after President-elect Donald Trump, hostile to the policies, assumes office on Jan. 20. The pending conservative legal challenges could undo important elements of Obama’s presidential legacy if Trump, as expected, opts not to defend the Obama policies in court or simply ditches the initiatives that are under attack. Since Trump’s election on Nov. 8, various courts have delayed action in three groups of cases that will not be resolved before Obama leaves office and blocked an administration regulation from going into effect in another. They include a challenge by House of Representatives Republicans to an important provision in the Obamacare law, and cases concerning religious objections to that law’s mandate that employers provide health insurance coverage for birth control. They also include Obama’s executive action, put on hold by the Supreme Court in June, to spare from deportation millions of immigrants in the country illegally, and his administration’s bid to extend overtime protections for workers. Republican-governed states like Texas were behind some of the biggest challenges to Obama policies. “We have a host of cases pending against the federal government due to the Obama administration’s overreach,” said Marc Rylander, a spokesman for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican who has sued the administration on various issues including immigration. Rylander said Texas officials “will continue to pursue all of these cases and look forward to working with a new administration.” The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Monday put on hold the House Republican Obamacare challenge until at least Feb. 21.  Trump and Republican congressional allies have said they plan to repeal and replace the law, meaning the case could become moot. The Obama administration opposed the delay in that case, but agreed to put on hold its effort to revive Obama’s 2014 immigration plan. The administration and the states that challenged the plan filed a joint motion on Nov. 18 saying the case should be put on hold “given the change in administration.” Trump has vowed to crack down on immigrants in the country illegally and is expected to abandon Obama’s blocked policy. The series of cases pending in lower courts concerning efforts by Christian groups to obtain an exemption to a provision of the Obamacare law requiring employers to provide health insurance coverage for contraceptives are also in a holding pattern. The Supreme Court sent the cases back to lower courts in May, throwing out several rulings in favor of the administration.  The lower courts are now awaiting the change in administrations. In one of the cases, before the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, lawyers for some of the religious groups said in court papers that a delay “will afford the newly-inaugurated president and new administration an opportunity to take a fresh look at this litigation and consider potential resolutions acceptable to all sides.” In the labor case, a federal judge on Nov. 22 prevented Obama’s regulation to extend mandatory overtime pay to more than 4 million salaried workers from going into effect on Dec. 1 as scheduled. That will give Trump leeway to change course when he takes office. So far, courts have not delayed action on several other cases involving key Obama policies, including a state and industry challenge to rules to curb greenhouse gas emissions mainly from coal-fired power plants. An appeals court in Washington heard oral arguments in September but has not yet issued a ruling. Trump has said he plans to rescind the regulation. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has agreed to decide a major transgender rights case that hinges in part on the Obama administration’s policy position in support of a female-born transgender high school student named Gavin Grimm, who identifies as male and sued in 2015 to win the right to use the school’s boys’ bathroom. The court has not yet scheduled oral arguments in the case. It is due to rule by the end of June. ",politicsNews,"December 6, 2016 ",0
THIS COMPANY PUTS UP A BILLBOARD THAT FINALLY GETS #BlackLivesMatter RIGHT… WITHOUT THE RACIST CONNOTATION,"Black lives matter but only when white cops are responsible for their deaths.

It s a statement directed against black-on-black crime.Normally, liberals take umbrage at the idea that somebody might evaluate problems caused within the black community by other blacks because it doesn t suit the narrative.

 A Van Struck Down Muslims In London,"A horrifying incident took place in the early hours of Monday morning in Finsbury Park in London.A van plowed into a group of Muslim worshipers as they were leaving prayers at a pair of North London mosques.Yep   you read that right. A terrorist attack has happened in London against Muslims. This incident follows two recent terrorist attacks in London in which vehicles have been used as weapons, both on bridges over the Thames River. So far this attack has left one person is dead and 10 others injured. This is being treated as a terrorist attack,  said Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu told reporters. He added that the driver of the van was arrested on suspicion of murder.According to the Washington Post, witnesses said the driver of the vehicle was heard shouting that he wanted to kill Muslims.Thankfully, the driver didn t get away. The Washington Post reports that Abdulrahman Aidroos and his friends were attending to an elderly man who had collapsed on the ground when suddenly he saw a man in a van driving  straight into us. When the driver of the van jumped out of the vehicle and tried to run  I tackled him on the floor until the police came,  Aidroos told the BBC.  When he was running, he said  I want to kill more people, I want to kill more Muslims. It s absolutely appalling and to think another human being has done this.Though it s clear there s something wrong with this attacker, we need to stop fear mongering when it comes to Muslims. The worst has now happened as a result.Muslims are entirely separate from ISIS just like the KKK is separate from the Christian church. Just like Nazism is entirely separate from Germans. There are bad people   evil people   in the world. But attacking innocent people won t stop the problem or rid the world of evil.

"Trump gains on Clinton despite furor over women, election comments","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump gained on Hillary Clinton among American voters this week, cutting her lead nearly in half despite a string of women accusing him of unwanted sexual advances and the furor over his disputed claims that the election process is rigged, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday. The survey also showed that 63 percent of Americans, including a third of Republicans, believe the New York real estate mogul has committed sexual assault in the past, though the Republican presidential candidate has denied the recent accusations. Clinton, the Democratic former secretary of state, led Trump 44 percent to 40 percent, according to the Oct. 14-20 poll, a 4-point lead, with the Nov. 8 election fast approaching. That compared with 44 percent for Clinton and 37 percent for Trump in the Oct. 7-13 poll released last week. Clinton’s lead also shrank in a separate four-way poll that included alternative party candidates: 43 percent supported her, while 39 percent supported Trump, 6 percent supported Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, and 2 percent supported Jill Stein of the Green Party. Support for Clinton had been mostly rising in the seven-day tracking poll since the last week of August, when the candidates were about tied. The latest reading showed that Trump’s deficit narrowed to what it was before a video surfaced on Oct. 7 featuring him bragging about groping and kissing women. Several women have since accused him of making unwanted sexual advances in separate incidents from the early 1980s to 2007. Trump has denied the allegations, calling them “totally and absolutely false.” The latest poll included a separate series of questions that asked people what they thought of Trump’s conduct around women. It found 63 percent of American adults, including 34 percent of likely Republican voters, agreed with the statement “I believe Donald Trump has committed sexual assault in the past.”  Reuters contacted a few of the poll respondents who said they felt that Trump had “committed sexual assault” but were still supporting his candidacy. Their answers were generally the same: Whatever Trump did with women in the past is less important to them than what he may do as president. “I’m embarrassed that our country can’t come up with better candidates, to be honest with you,” said Evelyn Brendemuhl, 83, of Hope, North Dakota. But “he’ll appoint more conservative judges, and she’s (Clinton) pro-abortion, and I’m not for that.” Gary Taylor, 59, a Republican from Colorado said his support stemmed mostly from a desire to see “something different than the last eight years” in the White House. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It included 1,640 people who were considered likely voters, given their voting history, registration status and stated intention to vote. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points, meaning results could vary by that much either way. The poll questions on Trump’s unwanted sexual advances scandal were asked of 1,915 American adults, including 546 likely Republican voters. It had a credibility interval of 3 percentage points for all adults and 5 points for Republican voters. ",politicsNews,"October 21, 2016 ",0

"Glitzy parties, bowling: Scenes from the other Republican convention","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Bourbon flowed, a jazz band played, and pink and violet lights bathed the vaulted stone ceilings at a party thrown by a liquor producers’ lobby group on Monday for attendees of the Republican National Convention. Seven blocks away in Cleveland, in the arena where Donald Trump was to officially accept his party’s nod for the White House, a fight boiled over between Trump supporters and foes about the rules concerning his nomination. Delegates shouted at each other. The chairman tasked with keeping order briefly abandoned the podium. Microphones went dead. Typically, the Republican convention that takes place every four years is a tale of two conventions. At the official one, activists from all 50 states come to hear testimonials about their party’s presidential nominee and watch the candidate’s official coronation. At the other, Republicans in the professional class - strategists, lobbyists, pollsters, lawmakers - rub elbows at cocktail hours and concerts, woo donors at power breakfasts and toss back booze at night, all the while conducting informal business, swapping pledges of support and plans for the future. This year, the disconnect between the two conventions seemed more pronounced, several lobbyists and activists said, and some parties were more subdued. The Distilled Spirits Council’s soiree, normally a jam-packed affair, drew a more modest crowd this year, according to some Republicans who have attended it at past conventions. The council’s senior vice president, Frank Coleman, pooh-poohed the idea that attendance was down. “It was a very large venue,” he said, saying that the party still attracted about 700 people over the course of the evening. Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said there was a muted tone at some Cleveland gatherings, which he attributed to the unique relationship between Trump and his party’s establishment. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate and a former Massachusetts governor, and Senator John McCain, the party’s 2008 nominee, hailed from the establishment and had extensive ties with businesspeople and strategists who are convention regulars. By contrast, Trump, a real estate developer and former reality TV star who has never held elective office, clinched the Republican nomination by touting his outsider status.  “You have a non-politician, a Hollywood entertainer trying to show Americans he’s fit for office, and you have Republicans who are used to coming to these things for years,” Bonjean said. The two groups, he said, weren’t mixing so smoothly. Inside the convention arena on Thursday evening, Trump fans cheered, danced to a band and roared support for a succession of speakers as they awaited the event’s finale - Trump’s speech formally accepting the nomination. But in bars and parties nearby, there was hardly any clapping and cheering as those same scenes flashed across televisions. Some Republicans flew in to Cleveland for only for a day or two, to host events for lawmakers and clients, then left before Trump’s Thursday night speech. One lobbyist for a large industrial conglomerate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, had a mission in Cleveland that had little to do with Trump: mingling with congressional Republicans and showing support for their re-election efforts. The informal convention did still take place, although more subdued. One strategist skipped a night of speeches and pageantry to gamble at a nearby casino. He won $8,000. A group of three made quick glances at a TV screen as Trump’s wife, Melania, spoke on Monday night, checking on her progress between turns at a bar with bowling lanes that had been converted to a private lounge. But there were constant reminders that Cleveland was different. As an outsider, Trump lacks the kind of donor network that is typical of major party candidates and only recently has begun to ramp up his fundraising. Before the convention started, companies that habitually donate to the RNC withheld pledges or withdrew them, leading organizers to ask casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, a generous party benefactor, for an urgent donation. A strategist who asked for help to raise a last-minute $15,000 to sponsor food and drinks at a country music concert for delegates could not find any corporate donors willing to pony up. Eight of the 12 people he contacted said they were skipping the convention entirely. On Tuesday, Trump passed up a chance to forge closer ties with more big donors when he failed to appear at a breakfast  held on the field of the new football stadium in town, according to a report in Time magazine. Later that day, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie met with donors to brief them on plans for a team that would ease Trump into office if he wins the Nov. 8 election against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Such gatherings often attract billionaires and other moneyed luminaries. A man in charge of fundraising surveyed attendees in the modestly sized conference room and declared, “I think I see about $600,000 in here.” ",politicsNews,"July 22, 2016 ",0

 Ellen DeGeneres Wasn’t Being Allowed Into The White House To Receive Her Medal Of Freedom (TWEET),"Tuesday at the White House, several people are set to receive the prestigious Medal of Freedom from President Obama. Those who will receive them include Tom Hanks, Michael Jordan and Ellen DeGeneres, among others.According to USA Today: For the last time in office, President Obama will bestow the nation s highest civilian honor on 21 individuals from a varying list of categories from science to sports to entertainment. There s been a slight snag with Ellen DeGeneres  entry to the White House, however. The television host and entertainer extraordinaire seemed to have forgotten her ID, and security at the White House won t let her in.But instead of get freaked out over it, because it likely gets solved in a timely manner, DeGeneres did what she always does, make a joke out of it. So she tweeted this: They haven t let me in to the White House yet because I forgot my ID. #NotJoking #PresidentialMedalOfFreedom They haven't let me in to the White House yet because I forgot my ID. #NotJoking#PresidentialMedalOfFreedom pic.twitter.com/sHocwqChKV  Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) November 22, 2016Surely, by the time this article even gets published DeGeneres will have been allowed into the White House considering she is one of the individuals being honored. However, it doesn t make the whole situation any less funny, because even Ellen, as recognizable as she is, was told she couldn t enter without proper identification.So, kudos to White House security for playing it safe no matter what, and congratulations to Ellen on her much deserved award.FeaturedPhoto by Kevin Winter/Getty Images",News,"November 22, 2016",1
"UK seeks arrest of Manchester bomber's brother, asks Libya to extradite him","LONDON (Reuters) - British police said on Wednesday they had issued an arrest warrant for the brother of a suicide bomber who killed 22 people in an attack on a pop concert in Manchester in May and prosecutors had asked Libya to extradite him. Salman Abedi, a 22-year-old Briton born to Libyan parents, blew himself up at the end of a show by U.S. singer Ariana Grande in the deadliest militant attack in Britain for 12 years. His victims included seven children among the victims while more than 500 were injured. Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, who is responsible for counter-terrorism in northwest England, said police had now applied for and been granted an arrest warrant for Abedi s younger brother Hashem for murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to cause an explosion.  Hashem Abedi is currently detained in Libya and the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) has now requested that Libyan authorities consider his extradition back to the United Kingdom,  Jackson said.  We are grateful for the Libyan authorities considering this request.  He added that detectives had not found any evidence of the involvement of any wider network.  Islamic State said it was responsible in the immediate aftermath of the bombing but security services have always treated the claim with scepticism. Days after the attack Libyan counter-terrorism investigators arrested Hashem Abedi and the brothers  father Ramadan.  In June, the Special Deterrence Force (Rada), a counter-terrorism force aligned with the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli, said Hashem Abedi had told them that his brother had been radicalised in Britain in 2015. They had both flown from Britain to Libya in April and Hashem said he had helped buy the equipment necessary for the attack although he had not known that Salman was planning a bombing, Rada said.  British police say Salman Abedi returned to Manchester on May 18, four days before his attack. The family had emigrated to Britain during the rule of the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, moving from London to the Fallowfield area of south Manchester where they lived for more than a decade. The brothers  parents returned to Libya during the country s 2011 revolution. Jackson said their investigation was still running  at a very fast pace  and the inquiry had involved a trawl through 16,000 hours of closed circuit TV (CCTV) footage and more than 8 million lines of telephone communications data. Police have previously said they believed Salman Abedi had built the bomb himself and CCTV showed him buying nuts from a hardware store that were used as shrapnel as well as the tin that was believed to contain the explosives.

 Ted Cruz Gets Cut Off Mid-Speech At Conservative Conference And Even CSPAN Is Mocking Him (VIDEO),"This last week has been an seemingly unending stream of terrifying, disturbing news about Trump and his administration. Adding to the mental instability and emotional immaturity of Trump, Republicans have renewed their push to strip 24 million Americans of healthcare. So it is with great relief that we can take a breather from all the terror to enjoy a moment of national unity  in laughing at Ted Cruz.The Texas senator and one-time Republican presidential candidate was attending the conservative  Faith and Freedom Coalition Conference.  He was not the headliner, that distinction went to the man who once called his wife ugly and suggested he had dirt on her that he would leak to the press. The headliner was also the guy who once accused Ted s dad of helping assassinate John F. Kennedy. The headliner was the guy Ted Cruz called a  pathological liar  and a  sniveling coward    and the same guy who Cruz eventually endorsed for president.Cruz had to play second fiddle to Trump.But Cruz s humiliation at the Faith and Freedom event was only getting started. During what was meant to be a fiery speech, Cruz was starting to hit his stride when suddenly  the announcer broke in, applause broke out, and a new speaker walked on to the stage. Cruz, looking confused and slightly hurt, was literally played off stage to music.CSPAN, the government-provided channel not known for its humor, even caught the moment and blasted it out to Twitter, signalboosting Cruz s embarrassment.Sen. @TedCruz is cut off in the middle of his remarks at the @FaithandFreedom Coalition Conference.

Kerry meets authors of dissenting cable on U.S. Syria policy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met on Tuesday with about 10 of the 51 State Department officials who last week wrote a cable disagreeing with U.S. policy toward Syria and arguing for “a more militarily assertive U.S. role.” Multiple U.S. officials have said they do not expect the memo, conveyed through the State Department’s relatively rarely used “dissent channel,” a conduit for voicing contrary views, to change U.S. President Barack Obama’s policy. In the cable, the diplomats call for military strikes against President Bashar al-Assad’s government to stop its persistent violations of a civil war ceasefire Obama’s policy toward Syria, where a civil war has burned for more than five years, has been predicated on the goal of avoiding deeper military entanglements in the Middle East, and has been widely criticized as hesitant and risk-averse. Obama’s limited intervention has focused on fighting the Islamic State militant group that controls a swathe of Syria and Iraq and that has inspired attacks on U.S. soil. The memo by the State Department officials demanded a more muscular stance. While State Department spokesman John Kirby said that Kerry had met with about 10 of the officials for half an hour on Tuesday, he declined to provide details of their discussion about the cable, which the department has not made public. “We believe that achieving our objectives will continue to elude us if we do not include the use of military force as an option to enforce the Cessation of Hostilities (CoH) and compel the Syrian regime to abide by its terms as well as to negotiate a political solution in good faith,” said a draft of the memo posted online by The New York Times.

" Trump Calls Out Anti-Fascists By Name, But FBI And DHS Say The Alt-Right Acts Like ISIS — And Goes Unmentioned","Ever since the Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia claimed the life of Heather Heyer, the entire spectrum on the Right   from moderates all the way to Alt-Right terrorists   has been scrambling to figure out a way to blame it on the Left. That s natural. It was a murder, after all. Nobody wants to take the blame for anything bad they re responsible for, let alone the murder of an innocent victim. But Donald Trump has been especially adept at seemingly calling out radical groups, while never actually explicitly naming the radical group that is to blame.It s not like he doesn t know the phrase  Alt-Right.  It s in the news every day. He sure as hell knows the word  Antifa.  That s the  many  in his  many sides  comment after Heyer s murder, which he doubled down on two days later. In fact, the word came out of his mouth in accusation at his Phoenix rally last Tuesday. Someone even made a joke about it: pic.twitter.com/9fANLcaXXN  Chris Stephens (@ChrisStephensMD) August 23, 2017The only time I can remember Trump saying the words  alt-right  in reference to Charlottesville was in Trump Tower: What about the  alt-left  that came charging at, as you say, the  alt-right ? Do they have any semblance of guilt? As YOU say.So why won t he address the Alt-Right? They are a terrorist group, by any definition. What s more, they identify as Christians, persecuted for their identity, justifying their actions with appeals to  us  over  them.  That s pretty reminiscent of another radicalized, religious extremist group that feels persecuted, hates outsiders and gay people, treats women like chattel, and uses terror and death to achieve their aims.Only those guys are brown.Here in America, though, ISIS and groups like them   that is to say,  radical Islamic terrorists    have nothing on white Christian males. A joint intelligence bulletin from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security found that the group we softly label  white supremacists  were responsible for 49 murders in 26 terror attacks over the last decade and a half. That s more than any other group in America. That report from two agencies tasked with American safety literally says that radicalized white Christian males are the most dangerous people in the country.Part of Trump s unwillingness to name the Alt-Right as the terror group they are comes from their Goebbels-like effectiveness with propaganda. If they can make it seem like there actually are two  sides  to the conflict that led to Heyer s death (and countless other injuries, physical, mental, and personal), they can paint their own side as justified in opposition to it. They achieve this with troll-led petitions that seem legitimate, and by posing as members of the Left and doing horrible things. Remember that kid who would break something, then leave a piece of it in his brother s room so his parents would bust the wrong boy? That s the Alt-Right.But the other part of Donald Trump s inability to name names when it comes to the Alt-Right is simple: They are his biggest fans, and he loves them, terrorism be damned.Featured image via Stephen Maturen/Getty Images",News,"August 26, 2017",1
"Trump summit with Mexico's Pena Nieto still on, 'for now'","MEXICO CITY, (Reuters) - A summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Mexican counterpart Enrique Pena Nieto next week is still on “for now”, Mexico’s foreign minister said on Wednesday, despite pressure at home to scrap it over objections to a border wall. Earlier in the day Trump signed new executive orders, including one authorizing a wall on the U.S. southern border, just as a Mexican delegation led by Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray arrived at the White House for talks.  The timing caused outrage in Mexico, with prominent politicians and many on social media seeing at as a deliberate snub to the government’s efforts to engage with Trump, who has for months used Mexico as a political punching bag. “The meeting between the two presidents in Washington next Tuesday is still confirmed,” Videgaray said. “The meeting, for now, is going forward,” he said.  President Enrique Pena Nieto said in a recorded message that he “disapproves” of Trump’s order on the border wall and in response ordered Mexico’s fifty U.S. consuls to extend legal help to citizens living in the United States. “Wherever there is a Mexican migrant who needs our help, we should be there,” he said. One source with knowledge of the government’s thinking said the measure was intended to clog U.S. immigration courts with legal objections to deportations. The courts already face a backlog of half a million cases. Videgaray said some “positive elements” resulted from the talks, including a blunt acknowledgment by Trump of the U.S. role in supplying illegal arms to Mexico. He also referred to Trump’s public comments that he wanted to see a strong Mexican economy. Videgaray said it had been “a day of contrasts,” adding that his delegation’s talks with senior White House aides lasted eight hours. Speaking as Trump gave orders to start work on the wall along the 2,000-mile (3,200-km) border with Mexico, two-time presidential runner-up and leftist opposition leader Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said the announcement was an insult to his country and called for international legal action. “I respectfully suggest that the government of Mexico presents a lawsuit at the United Nations against the U.S. government for violation of human rights and racial discrimination,” Lopez Obrador told a crowd of supporters north of Mexico City. A former mayor of the capital, Lopez Obrador has led several early opinion polls ahead of the July 2018 election, and last week he announced plans for a tour of major U.S. cities in February to drum up support among Mexican-Americans. Trump’s broadsides against Mexico have put Pena Nieto under rising domestic pressure. His approval ratings are at the lowest level of any Mexican president in years. The American’s threats to tear up a joint trade deal and impose hefty border taxes on Mexican goods have also battered the peso. But his comments on Wednesday that he wanted to see a strong Mexican economy lifted the currency to a three-week high. ",politicsNews,"January 26, 2017 ",0
 Ammon Bundy Just Got Sweet Justice Handed To Him By A Federal Judge (VIDEO),"Ammon Bundy and his armed ganged of militants have upset an entire nation over the last couple of weeks for their supposed special treatment by the police. While that did appear to be the case for the longest time, the raid was partially broken up by authorities after a shootout with one of Bundy s pals, LaVoy Finicum. Now, a federal court is refusing to give people that same impression   and they re sending the message loud and clear: There will be NO special treatment after laws have been broken, no matter who you think you are.On Friday, U.S. District Court judge Stacie Beckerman told Ammon Bundy and his brother that they would remain in jail and not be let out on bail pending their trial on federal conspiracy charges.If anyone knows anything about the court system, it s not a quick process. That means Ammon Bundy is going to be in jail for a long time. That should give him quite a long time to think about what he s done, and it should also discourage other so-called armed militants calling themselves  Federalists  out to protect peoples  rights from thinking they can get away with breaking the law, too.Pic via Twitter.The reason for the denial should come as no surprise, though: there are still four militants occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. If the judge released Bundy or any of the other perpetrators already arrested, they could simply return to the building. And   that s exactly what prosecutors communicated to the court before bail was denied. They also hilariously used the Bundys own words against them: This creates an inherent risk of flight. Moreover, [their] own statements demonstrate his unwillingness to comply with the terms of pretrial supervision.On August 16, 2015, Bundy posted on Facebook that  There is no justice in a federal court. The feds have used the courts to take rights, not protect them.' #breakingnews Read US Attorney s reason for wanting Ammon Bundy kept in jail #koin6news #Oregonstandoff pic.twitter.com/Yn6CZe5h8j  Dan Tilkin (@DanTilkinKOIN6) January 29, 2016We have a strange feeling Bundy didn t like the judge s decision.

“WHOSE STREETS?” NOT YOURS! NC Passes Law Shielding Drivers Who Hit Protesters Blocking Roads [VIDEO],"Soros paid protesters who blocked streets and created mass chaos in big cities cashed in before the election of President Trump. For the most part, when protesters blocked miles of traffic in large cities, law enforcement officers, who were also their target (thanks to another Soros-Obama effort) protected them from being unintentionally struck by vehicles on roads and highways they were blocking. Stories of people rushing to the hospital or trying to make it to work on time were circulating all over social media. Of course the mainstream media and leftist news sources were in collusion with Democrats in their efforts to threaten and shame Americans who dared to support Trump. They foolishly believed their violent and unlawful behavior would sway voters. In addition to putting people s lives in danger, In the end, Obama and George Soros  thugs turned a lot of people away from the polls, as many Democrat and independent voters didn t want to be tied to a party they no longer recognized.Watch protesters yell,  Whose streets? Our streets! :Just before the midnight curfew in #CLT the crowd is at the Square chanting. Doesn t look like they want to go home. #KeithScottA post shared by David Boraks (@davidboraks) on Sep 23, 2016 at 8:56pm PDTWatch anti-Trump Antifa terrorists take over major streets in DC chanting  Our streets! NC lawmakers are taking action to protect innocent drivers who encounter protesters who think jumping in front of traffic is a great way to protest. And oh yeah they re not your streets the streets belong to all Americans.WFAE   Stop me if you ve heard this one before. The North Carolina House has passed a bill that is sure to bring controversy.This measure shields drivers who hit protesters from lawsuits.Last year, in the wake of the killing of Keith Lamont Scott, protesters took over Charlotte city streets, even marching down sections of I-277 and I-85.The often chanted  Who s street? Our street! All this caught the attention of Republican Representative Justin Burr of Montgomery County.  As we ve seen, time and time again, as folks run out in the middle of the streets and the interstates in Charlotte and attempt to block traffic,  Burr said as he introduced the bill. He wants to ensure  drivers don t have to fear driving through Charlotte or anywhere in North Carolina. Now there are many ways this could be done.But Burr decided to go in a controversial direction with House Bill 330.He explains the bill this way,  provides that a person driving an automobile while exercising due care is immune for civil liability for any injury to another if the injured person was participating in a demonstration or protest and blocking traffic. Translation: a driver who hits, or even runs over, a protester on a street could be shielded from lawsuits by the person they injure.But Burr wanted to be clear on one point.  Now this bill does not allow for a driver of a vehicle to target protesters intentionally. That obviously is not the intention. Watch what happens here when protesters block a car that is on its way to St. Jude s Children s Hospital with a sick child: In other words, if you were trying to get from point A to point B and you just happen to hit a protester, or more, while driving through a demonstration, you would be protected from civil lawsuits. We all know this is being done to try to make a point about protests,  said Democrat Greg Meyer. He s just one of the lawmakers who saw a problem with this bill.  It is just going to embarrass us. There is no good reason to pass this bill. The bill has passed the North Carolina House. It now heads to the Senate. ",left-news,"Apr 30, 2017",1
 Donald Trump And Bernie Sanders Agree To Debate Before California’s Primaries,"Jimmy Kimmel landed a rare, on-air appearance from Donald Trump on the May 25th edition of his show, and wasted no part of the segment in grilling Trump on everything. Possibly the most interesting twist, however, came when Kimmel read a question from Bernie Sanders, who will be tonight s guest on  Jimmy Kimmel Live.  The question? Hillary Clinton backed out of an agreement to debate me in California before the June 7th primary. Are you prepared to debate the major issues facing our largest state and the country prior to the California primary? Trump, ever the attention-whore, replied with something surprisingly philanthropic: Yes, I am. How much is he going to pay me? Because if I debated him, we would have such high ratings and I think I should take that money and give it to some worthy charity. If he paid a nice sum for a charity I would love to do that. Trump later said that whatever network picked it up could donate the money to charity for this debate.The Sanders campaign wasted absolutely no time in responding to Trump on this:Game on. I look forward to debating Donald Trump in California before the June 7 primary.  Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) May 26, 2016This would be a truly interesting debate, especially given that primary season isn t over yet, despite all expectations that both nominations would be locked up by now. There have already been so many monkey wrenches thrown into the primaries that one would think nobody would notice this one. However, one would be very wrong   this could throw the biggest monkey wrench yet into the works, depending on how the two candidates interacted with each other and the moderators in such a setting.As of the time of this posting, there was no formal arrangement to actually hold this debate, and setting it up could be a logistical nightmare for the campaigns. That could change quickly, though, depending largely on whether the networks see any potential in it. Honestly, they d be idiotic not to want to do it.

"North Korean defectors may have been exposed to radiation, says South","SEOUL (Reuters) - At least four defectors from North Korea have shown signs of radiation exposure, the South Korean government said on Wednesday, although researchers could not confirm if they were was related to Pyongyang s nuclear weapons program. The four are among 30 former residents of Kilju county, an area in North Korea that includes the nuclear test site Punggye-ri, who have been examined by the South Korean government since October, a month after the North conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test, Unification Ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun told a news briefing.  They were exposed to radiation between May 2009 and January 2013, and all defected to the South before the most recent test, a researcher at the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, which carried out the examinations, told reporters. North Korea has conducted six nuclear bomb tests since 2006, all in tunnels deep beneath the mountains of Punggye-ri, in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions and international condemnation. The researcher cautioned that there were a number of ways people may be exposed to radiation, and that none of the defectors who lived had lived in Punggye-ri itself showed specific symptoms. A series of small earthquakes in the wake of the last test - which the North claimed to be of a hydrogen bomb - prompted suspicions that it may have damaged the mountainous location in the northwest tip of the country. Experts warned that further tests in the area could risk radioactive pollution. After the Sept. 3 nuclear test, China s Nuclear Safety Administration said it had begun emergency monitoring for radiation along its border with North Korea. And in early December, a state-run newspaper in China s Jilin province, which borders North Korea and Russia, published a page of  common sense  advice on how readers can protect themselves from a nuclear weapons attack or explosion. Cartoon illustrations of ways to dispel radioactive contamination were also provided, such as using water to wash off shoes and using cotton buds to clean ears, as well as a picture of a vomiting child to show how medical help can be sought to speed the expulsion of radiation through stomach pumping and induced urination.

California university system sues Trump over roll back of 'dreamers' program,"(Reuters) - A former top security official who helped put in place a program protecting people brought to the United States illegally as children, is suing the Trump White House as head of the University of California system over plans to roll back the policy. Janet Napolitano, the former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security under President Barack Obama, said in a lawsuit filed on Friday that ended the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival program, or DACA, violates the due process of about 800,000 beneficiaries, known as “dreamers,” who were granted permits that protected them from deportation. “The University has constitutionally-protected interests in the multiple educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body,” the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Northern California said. “If these students leave the University before completing their education, UC will lose the benefits it derives from their contributions, as well as the value of the time and money it invested in these students.” The lawsuit also argues Trump did not follow the proper procedures needed to cancel a program of this magnitude. California has more DACA recipients than any other state, many are in their 20s and are current students.  “They’ve grown up here, they’ve gotten their educations here, many of them don’t even speak the language of the country to which they would be deported if this decision were allowed to stand,” Napolitano said on a call with reporters. The legal challenge comes on top of a separate lawsuit filed earlier in the week by 16 Democratic Attorneys General saying the president’s decision to end the program was based in part on racial animus towards Mexicans, who are the largest beneficiaries. Department of Justice spokesman Devin O’Malley gave the same comment about Napolitano’s lawsuit as he did in response to the lawsuit by the states. Attorney General Jeff Sessions in announcing his decision to end the program said it was “inconsistent with the Constitution’s separation of powers.” Obama enacted DACA through an executive action implemented by the Department of Homeland Security after Congress failed to pass legislation. “While the plaintiffs in today’s lawsuit may believe that an arbitrary circumvention of Congress is lawful, the Department of Justice looks forward to defending this Administration’s position,” O’Malley said in a statement. Trump, who delayed the end of the program until March 5, shifted responsibility to a Congress controlled by his fellow Republicans, saying it was now up to lawmakers to pass immigration legislation that could address the fate of those protected by DACA. Trump’s move was criticized by business and religious leaders, mayors, governors, Democratic lawmakers, unions and civil liberties advocates.  Legal experts have said that court challenges to Trump’s actions could face an uphill battle, since the president typically has wide authority when it comes to implementing immigration policy.

 Fox Host Gives Trump The Most PATHETICALLY Desperate Advice For Winning Second Debate (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s first debate against his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton went just as poorly as we thought it would   and conservatives know it. It s never been more clear that Trump doesn t even deserve to be on the same stage as Clinton, and all the holes in his campaign are being exposed effortlessly. Between the fact-checking and not having any real policies or plans in place, Trump is f*cked big time. Luckily, Fox News is coming to the rescue with some (truly awful, somewhat hilarious) advice for the inexperienced man-baby.Fox News host Charles Krauthammer thinks that Trump s greatest chances of succeeding during Sunday s second presidential debate will rely on Trump s amazing ability to lie about everything. Basically, Krauthammer thinks Trump can win if he can  deny it ever happened  and  ignore the fact-checkers.  The Fox host pointed out where Trump had gone wrong during the first debate: I think the most important thing here for Trump is the morning after. He might have lost the debate. It was pretty close. It was not the rout that people say it was. But he really threw it away the morning after when he went after   he went down the rabbit holes on the Miss Universe and all the other stuff. And that s happened to him before. Krauthammer then tried to give Trump some pointers on how to beat a far more experienced, qualified Clinton: I think he can hold his own. He just needs to be   to ignore, as everybody here has said   ignore the bait. He should just dismiss all the quotations that he hears, the way that Pence did. Deny it ever happened and then ignore the fact checkers the next day. It is hilarious that anyone would suggest that Trump can  ignore the bait.  Trump is a loose cannon with the temperament worse than a toddler. Literally every time he gets baited (even by Clinton herself), he cannot resist taking it and making a bigger ass out of himself. Krauthammer is basically begging Trump to keep his ego in check, even though he s proven that he s incapable of doing that. Conservatives need to start accepting that Trump is going to blow this debate just like the first one, no matter how hard they try to guide him.You can watch Krauthammer try to help Trump below:[ad3media campaign= 1075 ]Featured image via Ethan Miller / Getty Images",News,"October 7, 2016",1
 Former Virginia Mayor Could Get 40 Years After Pleading Guilty To Trading Meth For Sex (VIDEO),"The former mayor of Fairfax City in Virginia is facing up to 40 years in prison after he pled guilty to trading crystal meth for sex. Richard  Scott  Silverthorne entered a guilty plea to one charge of distributing methamphetamine on Monday.This shocking story began in August of 2016 when Silverthorne was arrested. Police say they got a tip that he was using a website to set up casual sexual encounters and distribute meth. An undercover officer set up a fake profile on the site and Silverthorne took the bait. In just days he had responded to the undercover officer and arranged to meet him at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in McLean, Virginia. The police set up a sting operation and busted him when he gave the undercover cop two grams of meth. During the raid, police arrested Silverthorne and two other men.Silverthorne was released on his own recognizance last August and had remained free since then. It was expected that he would be released today to await his sentencing hearing, but instead, he was sent to jail. Reports say that there were  audible gasps  in the courtroom when the judge made the announcement.His sentencing hearing is scheduled for June 9. He could receive a maximum of 40 years behind bars and a hefty $500,000 fine. However, his attorney, Brian Drummond, says he is hopeful that Silverthorne will get time served and be placed on probation because of the decades he has spent as a public servant with no criminal record.Before he was caught trading drugs for sex, Silverthorne had been re-elected as Fairfax City Mayor. He was also a substitute teacher who worked in the Fairfax County Public Schools. After he was arrested, a special election was held in February of 2017 to replace him.You can watch more on this story here, via ABC7: Featured image via video screen capture",News,"March 14, 2017",1
East Libyan forces make new push to end Islamist resistance in Benghazi,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Eastern Libyan forces on Thursday expelled Islamist fighters from one of their last strongholds in the country s second-largest city of Benghazi, military officials said. The battle for Benghazi between the Libyan National Army led by Khalifa Haftar and an array of Islamist militants and other fighters has been part of a broader conflict since Libya slipped into turmoil following the 2011 fall of strongman Muammar Gaddafi. Several Islamists and one soldier were killed when special forces moved into the Khreibish district, one of the remaining pockets of resistance after Haftar declared victory in the battle for in Benghazi in July. Ten soldiers were wounded. Commander Wanis Bukhamada told Reuters on Thursday evening his special forces controlled almost the entire district after a day of heavy fighting.  Tonight will be the last night for Daesh in Khreibish,  he said, using a derogatory name for Islamic State. Haftar launched his  Operation Dignity  campaign in May 2014, slowly gaining the upper hand against Islamist militants and former rebels who fought Gaddafi in the 2011 uprising. Haftar is aligned with a government and parliament in eastern Libya. He has rejected a U.N.-backed government based in the capital, Tripoli, as he has gradually strengthened his position on the ground. ",worldnews,"November 9, 2017 ",0
Michigan governor asks Obama for federal aid in Flint water crisis,"DETROIT (Reuters) - Michigan Governor Rick Snyder has asked President Barack Obama to declare both an emergency and an expedited major disaster in the county where the city of Flint has been dealing with the fallout from lead-contaminated drinking water.

The financially strapped city was under control of a state-appointed emergency manager when it switched its source of tap water from Detroit’s system to the nearby Flint River in April 2014 to save money. Flint, which is about 60 miles (100 km) northwest of Detroit, returned to using that city’s water in October after tests found elevated levels of lead in the water and in the blood of some children. The more corrosive water from the Flint River leached lead from the city pipes more than Detroit water did, leading to the problems. “I am asking President Obama to provide additional resources,” Snyder said Thursday.  On Friday, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette said he would investigate whether any laws were violated in the crisis. “No one should have to fear something as basic as turning on the kitchen faucet.” The assistance Snyder has requested could include grants for temporary housing, home repairs and other needs. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will review the request and advise Obama. The White House said on Friday it would consider Snyder’s request. A FEMA spokesman said the agency will give its recommendation to the president as soon as possible. Several Michigan members of Congress on Friday urged Obama to provide the aid. Also on Friday, a bipartisan group of leaders on the House energy and commerce committee sent a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency requesting a briefing “in the coming days” on the Flint crisis. Some Flint residents sued Snyder, other officials, Michigan and the city on Jan. 7 in Genesee County court, seeking class action status covering all residents. Other Flint residents late last year filed a federal lawsuit. Genesee County also has seen a spike of Legionnaires’ disease resulting in 10 deaths that may be related to the water crisis, state officials previously said. Snyder said on Friday he supports the return of more executive powers to Flint Mayor Karen Weaver. Since the city is in receivership, a city administrator is currently responsible for day-to-day operations. ",politicsNews,"January 15, 2016 ",0
 Two VERY Different Visions For The Future Of The Democratic Party Are Battling It Out,"Following a traumatic Election Night and Donald Trump s unexpected win (of the electoral college), Democrats have been scrambling to figure out what went wrong. Beyond finding out where polling malfunctioned, liberals are struggling to understand what has happened within the party and how to go about fixing it. But as usual, there are some very different ideas about where the problem lies and how to remedy the situation   even when it comes to diversity.Two very different visions for the future of the Democratic PartyAccording to Mark Lilla of the New York Times, we need to quit focusing on our individual identities if we hope to save the Democratic party. In his piece The End of Identity Liberalism, he writes that we have been taught to celebrate  our differences. However, he argues that  this is a splendid principle of moral pedagogy   but disastrous as a foundation for democratic politics in our ideological age. In recent years American liberalism has slipped into a kind of moral panic about racial, gender and sexual identity that has distorted liberalism s message and prevented it from becoming a unifying force capable of governing. Our focus on teaching diversity in schools, Lilla said,  has produced a generation of liberals and progressives narcissistically unaware of conditions outside their self-defined groups, and indifferent to the task of reaching out to Americans in every walk of life. Lilla said that Hillary Clinton s great mistake was appealing to each individual group, which left out the white working class. National politics in healthy periods is not about  difference,  it is about commonality. And it will be dominated by whoever best captures Americans  imaginations about our shared destiny. He rejected the  whitelash  theory but also failed to acknowledge the blatant racism of Trump s campaign. He writes,  the whitelash thesis is convenient because it absolves liberals of not recognizing how their own obsession with diversity has encouraged white, rural, religious Americans to think of themselves as a disadvantaged group whose identity is being threatened or ignored. However, Lilla said nothing about the racism, anti-Semitism, and Islamophobia that was the basis of Trump s campaign. Trump used the racial tensions that resulted from having a black man in the white house and stoked the fires of bigotry. From the first day Trump announced that he was running for president, he used xenophobia to rally white America behind him. He was endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan and has now installed a white nationalist as his chief strategist.Trump never, at any point, offered a real plan for  making America great again  other than to promise that he would make life hell for anybody who isn t a straight white Christian male. But bigotry was enough to rally white America behind him.Lilla then warned that  Liberals should bear in mind that the first identity movement in American politics was the Ku Klux Klan, which still exists. Those who play the identity game should be prepared to lose it.  He concludes that  we need a post-identity liberalism,  and argued that taking on the concerns of specific minorities can be risky.We need a post-identity liberalism, and it should draw from the past successes of pre-identity liberalism. Such a liberalism would concentrate on widening its base by appealing to Americans as Americans and emphasizing the issues that affect a vast majority of them. It would speak to the nation as a nation of citizens who are in this together and must help one another. As for narrower issues that are highly charged symbolically and can drive potential allies away, especially those touching on sexuality and religion, such a liberalism would work quietly, sensitively and with a proper sense of scale. (To paraphrase Bernie Sanders, America is sick and tired of hearing about liberals  damn bathrooms.)Steve Phillips at the Nation has a radically different solution to what he feels is the problem facing progressives, as he wrote in his article, It s Time to Diversify the Democratic Party Leadership. And this picture says it all:Phillips explains that  nearly the entire top level of progressive leadership that controlled $1.5 billion in spending was made up of white people.   All of the individuals in the above table are good people, but none of them are from the hood. They don t hang out in black barbershops and beauty salons. They don t feel their hearts race when they see a police car s lights shining in their rear view mirror. They don t have family facing deportation to Mexico. They ve never been told to  go back to where you came from,  called a racial slur, or told to speak English. They ve never been detained at an airport because they look suspicious. They haven t lived the experiences of the people who comprise almost half of all Democratic voters.To win elections in an increasingly multiracial nation requires leadership and top staff who come from, understand, and are committed to the rapidly growing communities of color that are transforming the composition of the country. Whereas Lilla says we need to move away from identity, Phillips argues that now is the time, more than ever, to embrace our diversity at the top level of the Democratic party s leadership.  As last week s election revealed, the foundation of the Democratic home is structurally unsound. The time is now to focus on and fix the problem, and the first step in that direction is putting in place party leadership who understand how to build power and win elections in a racially combustible environment,  Phillips concluded.I tend to think it is a mixture of both these philosophies. Without a doubt, we need more diversity at the top. Even though Lilla got so much wrong, he was right in that we must find the common threads that unite us all as Americans. Yet, it is impossible to do that without acknowledging individuality and cultural diversity. To do that, we must do exactly as Phillips said and make sure the leadership of our party reflects the ever more diverse makeup of the country.Featured image via insurestory.com",News,"November 19, 2016",1
BREAKING: Michigan Native KID ROCK Announces He’s Running For US Senate,"Kid Rock, aka Robert (Bob) Ritchie, a native of Michigan who was born and raised in my hometown of Romeo, just announced on Twitter that he s running for US Senate. As a kid, I remember frequently sitting across from the Ritchie family in our local Catholic church. Kid Rock is a philanthropist who s done so much to help those in need in the city of Detroit. He s also very passionate about supporting our troops. Ritchie s made several overseas trips to play for our troops, and even donated specially designed homes for disabled veterans. Ritchie (Kid Rock) has not yet announced which party he ll be aligning himself with. He s been a staunch supporter of Republican presidential candidates in the past like Mitt Romney, Ben Carson and after he won the GOP primary, Kid Rock got behind Donald Trump. In 2013, Ritchie told Rolling Stones that he considers himself more of a libertarian. Stay tuned I have had a ton of emails and texts asking me if this website is real  https://t.co/RRVgISDFeq The answer is an absolute YES. pic.twitter.com/uYCUg6mjW1  Kid Rock (@KidRock) July 12, 2017Rock is one of the most prominent right-leaning voices in music, but he s also a somewhat irregular Republican:  I don t like the hardcore views on either side and I m not in bed with anybody,  he told Rolling Stone in 2013.  I d probably be more libertarian, but I m a firm believer you have to pick a side. I can t be playing the middle. If Rock runs as a Republican, he ll be up against Trump s Michigan Campaign Chair, Lena Epstein for the GOP nomination.Lena is a candidate the left will have a very hard time defeating. She s Jewish, she s a Harvard grad, and she s a tough-minded, successful business woman who wasn t afraid to jump in and support Trump from the moment he announced he was running. Rock may have his hands full with the very popular Lena Epstein, who we believe has the ability to defeat the very liberal Democrat Senator Debbie Stabenow.  Rock has the star power, but many will question if he s really got what it takes to run for US Senate.CBS Sunday Morning attempts to find out who badass rocker Kid Rock really is in this interview:And for those who might be saying (or thinking) Kid Rock running for Senate is crazy or ridiculous.

U.S. lawmaker's controversial tweet on immigration draws fire,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Steve King on Monday stood by controversial remarks on immigration and birth rates, in which he said “our civilization” could not be restored with “somebody else’s babies,” drawing condemnation from Democrats and fellow Republicans.  The speaker of the Republican-dominated House of Representatives, Paul Ryan, and the leading Democrat in the chamber, Nancy Pelosi, both took exception to King’s remarks.  The Iowa congressman on Sunday posted a tweet praising Geert Wilders, a nationalist, anti-Islam politician vying to become the Netherlands’ prime minister in a national election on Wednesday. “Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies,” King wrote in a post that drew thousands of “likes.” Pelosi on Monday called on House Republican leaders to condemn King’s comments, saying they “must decide whether white supremacy is welcome in the GOP ranks.” A spokeswoman for Ryan, AshLee Strong, said, “The speaker clearly disagrees (with King) and believes America’s long history of inclusiveness is one of its great strengths.”  King, an early supporter of Donald Trump in last year’s presidential election, defended his tweet in an interview on CNN on Monday. He pointed to Western Europe, where he said low birth rates were harming civilization, culture and values. “I’d like to see an America that is just so homogenous that we look a lot the same,” he said. “I think there’s far too much focus on race, especially in the last eight years. I want to see that put behind us.” Pressed on birth rates for different groups of Americans, King said: “They contribute differently to our culture and civilization.” Some of King’s House colleagues appeared to take his tweet personally. “What exactly do you mean?,” tweeted Republican U.S. Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida. “Do I qualify as ‘somebody else’s baby?’ #concernedGOPcolleague.” Democratic Representative Ted Lieu, who immigrated to the United States at age 3, tweeted a picture of his two sons, writing: “Dear Representative Steve King: These are my two babies — Representative Ted Lieu.” Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush said, “America is a nation of immigrants,” and added that King’s sentiment “doesn’t reflect our shared history or values.” Bush was one of Trump’s Republican rivals for the White House. The tweet also drew fire from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. The head of the civil and human rights law firm, Sherilyn Ifill, said King’s remarks were “an explicit call to return to the shameful period when white supremacy was the norm in American public life.”  Ifill said King’s remarks were “particularly dangerous” at a time when violent hate crimes have reached “dangerous levels.” King is from a rural state where nearly 92 percent of the population is white, compared with 77 percent for the nation as a whole, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Jeff Kaufmann, head of the Republican Party in Iowa, said in a statement that he disagreed with King, also calling the United States “a nation of immigrants” and saying that such diversity was its strength.

Erdogan says Turkey aims to open embassy in East Jerusalem,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey intends to open an embassy in East Jerusalem, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday, days after leading calls at a summit of Muslim leaders for the world to recognize it as the capital of Palestine. It was not clear how he would carry out the move, as Israel controls all of Jerusalem and calls the city its indivisible capital. Palestinians want the capital of a future state they seek to be in East Jerusalem, which Israel took in a 1967 war and later annexed in a move not recognized internationally. The Muslim nation summit was a response to U.S. President Donald Trump s Dec. 6 decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital. His move broke with decades of U.S. policy and international consensus that the city s status must be left to Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. Erdogan said in a speech to members of his AK Party in the southern province of Karaman that Turkey s consulate general in Jerusalem was already represented by an ambassador.  God willing, the day is close when officially, with God s permission, we will open our embassy there,  Erdogan said. Jerusalem, revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims alike, is home to Islam s third holiest shrine as well as Judaism s Western Wall - both in the eastern sector - and has been at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades. Foreign embassies in Israel, including Turkey s, are located in Tel Aviv, reflecting Jerusalem s unresolved status. A communique issued after Wednesday s summit of more than 50 Muslim countries, including U.S. allies, said they considered Trump s move to be a declaration that Washington was withdrawing from its role  as sponsor of peace  in the Middle East.

"Merkel in diplomatic push on North Korea, to speak with Putin: spokesman","BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel will speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of high-level talks aimed at increasing pressure on North Korea over its nuclear program, her spokesman said on Monday. Berlin remains ready to support discussions about ways to find a peaceful solution to the crisis, spokesman Steffen Seibert told a regular government news conference, noting that Germany is one of few countries with diplomatic ties with Pyongyang.  That is why we have offered to be helpful in the search for new ways to de-escalate the situation,  he said, hours before the U.N. Security Council was due to vote on a U.S.-drafted resolution that would impose new sanctions on Pyongyang.  The only conceivable solution is a peaceful and diplomatic one. But to achieve such a solution, the pressure on North Korea must be increased.  Merkel has already discussed the issue with U.S. President Donald Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron, South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and also planned a telephone call with Putin, he said. North Korea was condemned globally for conducting its sixth nuclear test on Sept 3, which it said was of an advanced hydrogen bomb. Merkel told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper on Sunday she was ready to become involved in a diplomatic initiative to end the North Korean nuclear and missiles program, and suggested the Iran nuclear talks could be a model. Germany and the five countries on the United Nations Security Council with veto power took part in talks that led to Iran agreeing a landmark deal in 2015 to curb its nuclear work in return for the lifting of most economic sanctions. Seibert said there had been no concrete request for Germany s help in initiating discussions over the North Korean crisis. Merkel, one of the world s longest serving democratic leaders, is expected to win a fourth term in office in a Sept. 24 vote, with polls giving her conservatives a double-digit lead over their main center-left rivals. Merkel is widely seen in Germany as a safe pair of hands at a time of global uncertainty such as the North Korea crisis, Britain s looming departure from the European Union and Donald Trump s presidency in the United States.

 Donald Trump Jr Posts Disgusting Lie About London’s Muslim Mayor Minutes After London Terror Attack,"This morning, a man drove his car into a crowd near the UK s parliament building and began attacking bystanders with a knife. Across the ocean, America s conservative handled the scary situation with characteristic boorishness. At the forefront of this despicable behavior was President Trump s own son. British police hadn t even confirmed the number of dead before Donald Trump Jr used the attack as a pretext to promote Islamophobia on Twitter.While emergencies workers worked on the injured and police began piecing together what happened, Don Jr. decided his contribution would be to spread a vicious and pathetic lie about London s mayor. Why would he focus on this man while the city was still in shock? Because Mayor Sadiq Khan is Muslim.In a tweet, Don Jr. implied Khan was somehow sympathetic to terrorists, inaccurately quoting him as having said  Terror attacks are part of living in big city [sic].  Don commented: You have got to be kidding me?! You have to be kidding me?!: Terror attacks are part of living in big city, says London Mayor Sadiq Khan https://t.co/uSm2pwRTjO  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 22, 2017Like clockwork, other conservative Trump-clingers began running with the quote as well.Will London's Muslim mayor, @SadiqKhan, once again say that Muslim terror attacks are just ""part and parcel"" of living in a major city?  Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) March 22, 2017Can't wait for London s Muslim Mayor to lecture us about how terror attacks are  part and parcel  of urban life  again.  Faith J. Goldy  ?? (@FaithGoldy) March 22, 2017The problem: The quote and the link used in Don Jr. s tweet are ludicrously wrong. The real quote paints Khan as a man not sympathetic to terrorism but vigilant about stopping terrorism. Here s the full quote given in 2016 to the Evening Standard: What I do know is that part and parcel of living in a great, global city is that you ve got to be prepared for these sort of things. You ve got to be vigilant. You ve got to support the police who do an incredibly hard job. You ve got to support the security services and I think speculating when you don t know the facts is unwise. In other words, Khan is doing all the things every mayor in every major city in the world is doing: Working to stop terrorism while knowing that a big city s size and landmarks make tempting targets. Nowhere does he accept that terrorism is  part and parcel  of urban life. Fighting it is.Don Jr has yet to express any condolences to the families of the victims. He s so far tweeted exclusively about Muslims (including this lie about London s mayor). The lack of basic decency seems to run in the family. Don Jr. s dad once commented on the mass shooting in Orlando by infamously saying  appreciate the congrats. It s like every tragedy is seen not as a horrifying moment of pain and suffering for the victims but something to be exploited to further an agenda. Don Jr desperately wants to smear Muslims and if it means lying about the mayor of the city that was just attacked, then that s what he ll do.Featured image via John Sommers II/Getty Images",News,"March 22, 2017",1
Zika sex research begins despite U.S. Congress funding impasse,"(Reuters) - It could take years to learn how long men infected with Zika are capable of sexually transmitting the virus, which can cause crippling birth defects and other serious neurological disorders. In the meantime, health officials have warned couples to refrain from unprotected sex for six months after a male partner is infected. The extraordinary recommendation, based on a single report of Zika surviving 62 days in semen, could affect millions. The grave risks associated with Zika, along with its potential reach, are driving U.S. health authorities to pursue research even though funding is mired in Congressional gridlock. A study of sexual transmission risk is one example of science that health officials said can’t wait for politics. Borrowing money earmarked for other programs, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has started enrolling men infected with Zika in Brazil and Colombia in the study to determine how long the virus remains transmittable in semen. The study could take years to complete, but interim results could help public health officials fine-tune their recommendations on sex. “We are going out on a limb, but we have to,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. institute, said in an interview. “We can’t say we’re going to wait until we get all the money.” Public health officials are alarmed by Zika’s transmission versatility, which has the potential to expand its reach. It is primarily spread by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, as are the dengue and chikungunya viruses. But at least 10 countries, including the United States and France, have reported Zika infections in people who had not traveled to an outbreak area but whose sexual partners had. This ability to spread through sex could help Zika gain a further foothold outside the warm habitats of its most effective agent, the mosquito. To protect women who are pregnant or trying to conceive, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended couples refrain from unprotected sex for six months - triple the 62 days the virus survived in the semen in one British case study. The World Health Organization recently issued similar guidance. But such strict advice is not ideal, Dr. Anne Schuchat, a CDC deputy director, said in an interview. “To tell people not to have sex until we get back to you is not a very satisfying recommendation,” she said. “We would like to have some more understanding of the sexual risk.” In the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, where more than 2,100 cases of infection have been reported since the start of the year, health officials are passing out Zika protection kits that include bug spray and condoms, along with the recommendation. But the warning against unprotected sex isn’t going over very well, said Dr. Chris Prue, a CDC behavioral scientist who has studied the response. “Condoms are not popular in a lot places,” she said. “There’s religious and personal preferences and lots of personal factors in that.” U.S. lawmakers deadlocked over funding to fight the Zika virus on Tuesday, as Senate Democrats blocked a Republican proposal they said fell short of the challenge posed by the virus and hurt other health priorities. It was unclear when Congress would revisit the request by President Barack Obama for $1.9 billion. In the meantime, the White House has diverted more than $500 million earmarked for other projects for urgent Zika initiatives, including those where scientific opportunities will be lost if not acted upon immediately. One such study will follow children born to women infected with Zika to identify the development of any disabilities not detected at birth. Other projects on the priority list include vaccine development and mosquito eradication.    One study underway will assess whether the risk of transmission is greater from men who experience Zika infection symptoms, such as fever and rash, than from those who don’t. This information is considered vital since most people experience no symptoms. The study of infected men in Brazil and Colombia will test semen from thousands of men over time to determine how long Zika poses a risk to sexual partners. As long the virus can be grown in a laboratory from semen cell samples, infectious disease experts believe it is potentially contagious. Zika typically clears the bloodstream about a week after infection, but it has been detected in urine for at least twice as long. Its persistence in semen in the British case study has caused some researchers to draw comparisons to other viruses. HIV can last in blood and semen indefinitely, and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus can reside in the kidneys and urine for years, researchers said. One patient who survived the deadly Ebola outbreak had evidence of that virus in his semen for 18 months. “We got very surprised by Ebola that it was hanging around for so long,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. “One of the big questions we have to ask is does Zika also cause a similar type of latency?” ",politicsNews,"June 30, 2016 ",0

" Bundy Militant Loses Foster Kids, Blames It On The Tyrannical Government","One of the Bundy  militiamen  has lost his sole source of income thanks to his decision to join the merry mob of marauding morons in their armed occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. Was he skipping work? Nah   he would have to have a job for that. Robert  LaVoy  Finicum tells Oregon Public Broadcasting that he lost his meal ticket   children.Over the past decade, Finicum and his wife s home has served as nothing more than a revolving door for foster children, with more than 50 kids coming through their home. The children, who often came from mental hospitals, drug rehabs, and group homes for emotionally distressed youth not only provided the happy couple with a steady income thanks to money they received from the state, but also with workers on his ranch (which barely makes enough money to stay afloat). My ranch has been a great tool for these boys,  Finicum said.  It has done a lot of good.  Unfortunately, when Finicum ran off to play terrorist with his friends and he left four young, emotionally disturbed boys home alone to be cared for by his wife, let s just say some flags were raised. Within four days of Finicum s departure, the Arizona Department of Social Services began to remove his meal tickets from the home. They didn t go out at the same time,  Finicum said.  One was there for a year, one of the boys was there six months, another eight months, and a month. I don t know where they ended up.  Rather than blame his involvement with a terrorist group or his own irresponsibility, Finicum says the removals resulted from  pressure from the feds : They were ripped from my wife. We are very successful (foster parents). Our track records are good, it s been a good relationship. (Federal authorities) must have gotten to the governor, who told the state to get them out of there. OPB reports that this is a staggering loss of income from the Finicums, who have depended on the between $22.31 to $37.49 per day they were paid to take care of the children. According to a 2010 tax filing, the Finicums received $115,343 in 2009. At the maximum rate, this means they  cared for  an average of 8 children per day that year. And it s exactly those dollar signs that concern Finicum, not the children he was tasked with caring for as his own: That was my main source of income. My ranch, well, the cows just cover the costs of the ranch. If this means rice and beans for the next few years, so be it. We re going to stay the course. Another of the Bundy militants, Blaine Cooper, also claims that Child Protective Services removed his children from his home. At the Facebook page All Your Base, Cooper claimed that the removal of his children, which can not be independently verified, was an attempt by the FBI to  draw him out,  blaming the removals on  bias media and asshole s like  the page owner. I hope people are seeing the sacrifices we re making here,  Finicum said.  I want to show what my government is doing. You need to understand the cost being paid by many people. Finicum has pledged to die in defense of the militants  armed encampment  proving that he is someone who should not be entrusted with the care of children.

 Conservatives Will Hate Why Obama Invited This Woman To The State Of The Union,"President Obama is using his final State of the Union address to spike the ball on some of the accomplishments he has been able to achieve in the two terms of his presidency. As evidence of those achievements, several guests have been invited to sit with First Lady Michelle Obama.Among those guests will be U.S. Army Major Lisa Jaster, and her sterling accomplishment was becoming one of the first three women in the history of the United States to qualify as a U.S. Army Ranger.Before Obama was President, women were not permitted to try out for this elite designation. Now they are.Jaster was one of 19 women who attempted the Army Ranger course in April, when it was opened to female service members for the first time. In some ways, she was the most unusual of them: While most troops who attend are on active duty, male and in their 20s, she was a 37-year-old officer who was activated from the Army Reserve to go, temporarily leaving behind a successful career as an engineer with Shell Oil in Houston and her husband and two young children for a shot at making history.Jaster said in a phone interview Friday that she wants to show that there are men and women capable of succeeding in almost any role. I want my presence to symbolize the fact that there are competent people out there, and as long as the standards don t change, the best person for each job needs to be placed in that job,  she said.Amazingly, in this day and age there are conservative Republicans who still oppose the idea of women serving in combat positions in the military, despite most Americans realizing that if they can pull their own weight there should be no obstacle to service simply due to gender.Major Jaster shows that it can be done, and that America has finally reached a place where we have the best defending us no matter what sex they are. That s part of the Obama legacy.Featured image via YouTube",News,"January 11, 2016",1
"In photos, North Korea signals a more powerful ICBM in the works","SEOUL (Reuters) - With photographs obliquely showing a new rocket design, North Korea has sent a message that it is working on an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) more powerful than any it has previously tested, weapons experts said on Thursday. If developed, such a missile could possibly reach any place on the U.S. mainland, including Washington and New York, they said. North Korea s state media published photographs late on Wednesday of leader Kim Jong Un standing next to a diagram of a three-stage rocket it called the Hwasong-13. Missile experts, who scrutinize such pictures for clues about North Korea s weapons programs, said there is no indication the rocket has been fully developed. In any case, it had not been flight tested and it was impossible to calculate its potential range. However, a three-stage rocket would be more powerful than the two-stage Hwasong-14 ICBM tested twice in July, they said. South Korean and U.S. officials and experts have said the Hwasong-14 may have a range of about 10,000 km (6,200 miles) and could possibly strike many parts of the United States, but not the East Coast.  We should be looking at Hwasong-13 as a 12,000-km class ICBM that can strike all of the mainland United States,  said Kim Dong-yub, a military expert at Seoul s Kyungnam University.  It s likely meant to show that they are working on a three-stage design with greater boost and range,  said retired Brigadier General Moon Sung-muk, an arms control expert who has represented South Korea in military talks with North Korea. He said the pictures were intended to show that North Korea was refusing to bow to international pressure to abandon its weapons programs.  The North is trying to be in control of the playing field,  Moon said. Wednesday s report carried by the KCNA news agency lacked the traditionally robust threats against the United States, and U.S. President Donald Trump expressed optimism about a possible improvement in relations. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said it was unclear if the photos were taken before or after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday welcomed what he called the restraint North Korea had shown recently in its weapons programs and said he hoped a path could be opening for dialogue  sometime in the near future.    We consider it overall a good first step that there haven t been any missile launches or testing for ...three-plus weeks or so,  Nauert told a regular briefing. However Pyongyang needed to do a lot more to show it was willing to negotiate in good faith, she said.  The photographs were accompanied by a report of Kim issuing instructions for the production of more rocket engines and warheads during a visit to the Academy of Defense Sciences, an agency he set up to develop ballistic missiles.  We re getting a look at it to emphasize domestic production of missiles, and to advertise what s coming next,  said Joshua Pollack, a nuclear weapon and missile systems expert who edits the U.S.-based Nonproliferation Review. The photographs were published as tensions between North Korea and the United States appeared to have eased slightly since North Korea tested the Hwasong-14 and later threatened to fire missiles toward the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam.  Kyungnam University s Kim said the Hwasong-13 appeared similar to the KN-08, a three-stage missile of which only a mockup has previously been seen at military parades. But the new images show a modified design for the main booster stage that clusters two engines. Another picture published by North Korean state media showed Kim Jong Un standing next to a rocket casing that appeared to be made of a material that could include plastic. Experts said if such material were used in the missile, it would be intended to reduce weight and boost range. The photographs also showed the design for the Pukguksong-3, likely a new solid-fuel intermediate-range ballistic missile being developed for submarine launches.

Russian foreign minister: Trump team are people of action,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, on a visit to Washington, said on Wednesday that his discussions with people in the Trump administration persuaded him they were people of action who wanted to cut deals and solve problems. Speaking at a news conference in the Russian embassy in Washington, Lavrov said that his talks with U.S. officials had not covered the U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia over its role in the Ukraine conflict. He said the focus of his discussions had been on creating so-called de-escalation zones inside Syria. “Now our dialogue is free of the ideologization that was characteristic of the Obama administration,” Lavrov said. “The Trump administration, and the president himself, and the Secretary of State, I was persuaded of this once again today, are people of action.” Lavrov said the administration officials “want to reach agreements not for the sake of showing off their achievements in terms of ideological preferences, but to reach agreements into order to resolve specific issues.” ",politicsNews,"May 10, 2017 ",0
 Joy Behar Just SHREDDED Trump After He Praised Putin And Slammed Obama (VIDEO),"While most of the press is content in letting Donald Trump get away with the horrible things he says and won t hold his feet to the fire, at least one person isn t holding back   Joy Behar of The View.After Trump told Matt Lauer during NBC s Presidential Forum that he s happy to be praised by Russia s Vladimir Putin, all the while putting down President Obama, Joy Behar was ready to tear him a new one.Trump even went so far to say that Putin has been a leader  far more  than President Obama has. Keep in mind, Putin cares nothing about the human rights of many of his citizens, most especially gay individuals.And the only reason Putin has been praising Trump is because he knows that if Trump were in power it would be easier for him to power-grab. Putin seems to see Trump as the weaker candidate who will be easier to manipulate due to his lack of experience.Behar started by saying: He forgets that we have checks and balances in this country. We have a constitution. The Russians don t have such a thing. Then, after Candace Cameron Bure tried to spew some nonsense saying Putin makes Russians feel safe, Behar really let Trump have it. She said: The polls in Russia. Is he talking about Polish people? Or is he talking about polls? Because the dictatorship that is Putin is controlling the polls, okay? Then after it was explained that the media doesn t even have representation in Russia, which honestly seems like something Trump would like, Behar said: It s so unpatriotic, is what it is. And for him to say such things, in front of our military, is a disgrace. Which is exactly what it is, and yet another reason Trump shouldn t be allowed anywhere near the Oval Office.Watch Joy Behar tear Trump a new one here:.@joyvbehar on Trump saying Putin is a better leader than Obama:  to say such things   is a disgrace.  https://t.co/MRUf4SsyyN  The View (@TheView) September 8, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 8, 2016",1
 House Republicans Pave Way For Rampant Corruption Under Trump By Gutting Independent Ethics Panel,"House Republicans just made it clear that they are for sale and intend to put ethics aside during Donald Trump s reign in the White House.On Monday night, Republicans voted 119-74 to cripple the independent Office of Congressional Ethics, which has been an outside watchdog working to root out corruption by members of Congress ever since a string of lobbying scandals rocked Capitol Hill. Under Speaker Nancy Pelosi s leadership, the panel was created as a non-partisan entity and has done a good job.But Republicans are gutting it because the panel has done its job too well so they passed an amendment which basically gives them direct oversight of the panel and the power to kill investigations they don t like. So if the panel is investigating a Republicans, they can kill it and then turn around and allow an investigation against a Democrat.According to CNN,The proposal would bar the panel from reviewing any violation of criminal law by members of Congress, requiring that it turn over any complaint to the House Ethics Committee or refer the matter to an appropriate federal law enforcement agency. The House Ethics Committee would also have the power to stop an investigation at any point and bars the ethics office from making any public statements about any matters or hiring any communications staff.And the ethics office would no longer be able to accept or investigate any anonymous reports of alleged wrongdoing by members of Congress.Republicans claim that the ethics panel abused its power and that it  falsely accused  members of Congress of committing ethics violations. These members allegedly had to  spend a fortune  to defend themselves. Frankly, it sounds like Republicans are just mad because they got caught putting their hand in the cookie jar and they are attacking the panel to make sure they can t be caught again.By gutting the independent panel and placing it under their supervision, Republicans just paved the way for their members to commit crimes at will. They could a take a bribe from a lobbyist and then vote to kill any investigation that arises. It will create a free-for-all for lobbyists at a time when Republicans intend to consider infrastructure spending, tax cuts, and massive defense spending.This especially concerns Norman Eisen and Richard Painter, who served as ethics attorneys under President Obama and President Bush, because the 115th Congress  is setting itself up to be dogged by scandals and ethics issues for years and is returning the House to dark days when ethics violations were rampant and far too often tolerated. So not only will the White House be corrupt under Donald Trump, Republicans just guaranteed that the House of Representatives is going to be corrupt as well, proving once again that Republicans only care about using government to enrich themselves instead of helping the American people.Featured image via Zach Gibson/Getty Images",News,"January 2, 2017",1
A MUST WATCH! Mark Steyn Calls Out Political Violence On The Left: “They’ve got to own this!” [Video],"Mark Steyn was on fire last night! If you were lucky enough to hear his brilliant take on the left, you know he hit it out of the park with his commentary. Note that it gets really good in the last minute. He s awesome!STEYN DISCUSSED THE  DEHUMANIZING  OF YOUR OPPOSITION IN A SPECIAL OP-ED ABOUT THE POISONING OF ROBERT SPENCER: The Poisoning of Robert Spencer,  by Mark Steyn, May 18, 2017:For years now I ve said that anti-free-speech leftists and the men who slaughtered the staff of Charlie Hebdo, shot up Lars Vilks  event in Copenhagen, etc, are merely different points on the same continuum: They re both in the shut-up business: both groups find it quicker and easier and more satisfying to silence you than to debate you.There were those who found the comparison offensive   to whom I would on good-humored days grant that the two points on the same continuum were nevertheless some distance apart.Well, they got considerably closer in Reykjavik last week.Robert Spencer, the author of several bestselling books on Islam, a brave crusader against the dopier multiculti illusions and the proprietor of the indispensable Jihad Watch, gave a speech at the Grand Hotel, went to unwind at dinner afterwards, and was poisoned by a social-justice warrior. Here s Robert s account of what happened That s quite a sophisticated operation   a two-man team, the first a fake fan, the second a post-kiss-of-death gloater.Before the banking crash of  08, Iceland was flush, and celebs like Elton John were flown in for gala bashes. But it s all quietened down a bit since then, so the Spencer event was a big deal. He drew an audience of 500   which in a town of 125,000 and a nation of 300,000 is pretty impressive. There was lots of coverage of his visit   none of which actually quoted him or excerpted his speech or interviewed those who were interested in hearing what he had to say. Instead the media preferred to cover the few dozen protestors of his trip. In all the column inches devoted to Robert Spencer, no journalist thought to seek a comment from Robert Spencer. There are two sides to every story   except this guy s story: he doesn t deserve a side.This kind of dehumanization sends a message   and the man who poisoned Robert got it loud and clear:Those who paint the targets, and those who shoot at them, think they re doing something great. Not only does the Left fill those whom it brainwashes with hate, but it does so while portraying its enemies as the hatemongers, such that violent Leftists such as the young man who drugged me feel righteous as they victimize and brutalize for the crime of disagreement.I have no doubt whatsoever that whoever poisoned me in Iceland went away feeling happy over what he had done. If he told anyone what he did, I m sure he was hailed as a hero. I m also aware that many who read this will crow and exult in knowing that someone who hates my opposition to jihad terror and Sharia oppression made me seriously ill. This is how degenerate and evil the Left has become.I don t know how I d stand up to a cocktail of Ritalin and Ecstasy. I do know there s at least one person in my modest entourage it would kill. And I have no doubt that had the fellow in the restaurant switched on the radio the following morning and heard that Robert Spencer had died in hospital overnight he would have celebrated.Like the guns at Singapore, the social-justice mob s fingers are pointing in the wrong direction: They accuse their opponents endlessly of  otherization ; yet they are the ones who so deny the humanity of  the other  that it seems cool and heroic to attempt to kill a chap who gave a speech you object to   even though you never heard the speech, and, even if you had, are incapable of articulating what exactly in it you take issue with.Douglas Murray and I noted after the tenth anniversary of the Mohammed cartoons how strangely controversial the post-event dinner has become. In Copenhagen, the restaurant panicked at the sight of the PET   the Danish security-service agents   and canceled our booking. As Douglas wrote:Ten years ago, you could publish depictions of Mohammed in a Danish newspaper. Ten years later, it is hard for anyone who has been connected with such an act to find a restaurant in Copenhagen that will serve them dinner.For those in Robert Spencer s line of work, these events are undeniably stressful. There are security precautions, of course, but you never know, from the Vilks event in Copenhagen to Robert s in Garland, Texas, whether some jihadist will succeed in breaking through. There s a sense of relief when you exit the stage and it s all gone off without incident. You re looking forward to a drink and a bite to eat in convivial company. And you re on your post-performance high, so you re generally bonhomous when people approach professing to be fans and seeking a selfie or an autograph. And there s three or four and they re all around you, and you put your drink down on the table   as Douglas and I did again and again in the bar we wound up in late that night. And the fans move on, and you pick up your glass without a thought Robert Spencer will never do that again.The social-justice crowd are moving toward the same point as the Charlie Hebdo killers, and for the same reason: They re too stupid to argue. For the Islamic imperialists, debate is a largely alien concept. For the left, it s simply too much effort. As I said here many years ago, the great appeal of multiculturalism is that it absolves you from having to know anything about other cultures: If they re all equally valid, what s the point? Slap on the CO-EXIST bumper sticker and off you tootle. No need to worry whether the  C  might have a bit of a problem with some of the other letters, and that indeed, if not for the  C , you wouldn t need a bumper-sticker admonition to CO-EXIST in the first place. But, after two generations of social engineering, of the substitution of attitudes for education, it would require too much effort to equip yourself to argue against the difficult questions a man such as Robert Spencer raises. It s literally easier to kill him.Not yet in the blood-lusting exultant scimitar-raising style of the decapitators of French priests. But just through whatever you ve got in your stash that might ensure he ll be flying out of Reykjavik by the handles. So for the moment there is still a continuum. But it s narrowing, and will narrow still.Get well soon, Robert.",left-news,"Jun 15, 2017",1
Aid groups seek $434 million to help up to 1.2 million Rohingya Muslims fleeing Myanmar,"COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Humanitarian organizations helping Rohingya Muslim refugees in Bangladesh said on Wednesday they need $434 million over the next six months to help up to 1.2 million people, most of them children, in dire need of life-saving assistance. There are an estimated 809,000 Rohingya sheltering in Bangladesh after fleeing violence and persecution in Myanmar, more than half a million of whom have arrived since Aug. 25 to join 300,000 Rohingya who are already there.  Unless we support the efforts of the Bangladesh government to provide immediate aid to the half million people who have arrived over the past month, many of the most vulnerable   women, children and the elderly   will die,  said William Lacy Swing, director general of the International Organization for Migration, which is coordinating the aid effort.  They will be the victims of neglect.   About 509,000 Rohingya have arrived in Bangladesh since attacks by Rohingya militants in August triggered a sweeping  Myanmar military offensive that the United Nations has branded ethnic cleansing. Myanmar rejects accusations of ethnic cleansing. It says its forces are fighting insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) who claimed responsibility for attacks on about 30 police posts and an army camp on Aug. 25. The insurgents were also behind similar but smaller attacks in October last year that led to a brutal Myanmar army response triggering the flight of 87,000 Rohingya to Bangladesh. The agencies  plan for help over the next six months factors in the possibility of another 91,000 refugees arriving, as the influx continues, Robert Watkins, U.N. resident coordinator in Bangladesh, said in a statement.  The plan targets 1.2 million people, including all Rohingya refugees, and 300,000 Bangladeshi host communities over the next six months,  Watkins said.. Half a million people need food while 100,000 emergency shelters are required. More than half the refugees are children, while 24,000 pregnant women need maternity care, the agencies said. U.N. appeals for funds to help with humanitarian crises are generally significantly under-funded. The Rohingya are regarded as illegal immigrants in Buddhist-majority Myanmar and most are stateless. Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has faced scathing criticism for not doing more to stop the violence, although she has no power over the security forces under a military-drafted constitution. She has condemned rights abuses and said Myanmar was ready to start a process agreed with Bangladesh in 1993 under which anyone verified as a refugee would be accepted back. But many Rohingya are pessimistic about their chances of going home, partly because few have official papers confirming their residency. Most are also wary about returning without an assurance of  citizenship, which they fear could leave them vulnerable to the persecution and discrimination they have endured for years. The rights group Amnesty International said the international community had to ensure that no refugees are forced back to Myanmar as long as they remain at risk of serious rights violations. The U.N. refugee agency says any repatriation has to be voluntary. Human Rights Watch said it had found evidence that the Myanmar military had summarily executed dozens of Rohingya in a village called Maung Nu in Rakhine state, on Aug. 27, two days after the insurgent attacks triggered the violence. The rights group said it had spoken to 14 survivors and witnesses who were now refugees in Bangladesh. They described how soldiers entered a compound where people had gathered in fear of military retaliation.  They took several dozen Rohingya men and boys into the courtyard and then shot or stabbed them to death. Others were killed as they tried to flee,  said the rights group, which has accused Myanmar of crimes against humanity. Spokesmen for the government, the military and police did not answer their telephones and were not available for comment. Wednesday is a holiday in Myanmar. Reuters was not able to independently verify the report. The U.N. committees for women s and children s rights called on Myanmar to immediately stop violence in Rakhine, saying violations  being committed at the behest of the military and other security forces  may amount to crimes against humanity.

"Clinton names close confidants, Obama veterans to transition team","WASHINGTON/PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton’s White House transition team, a mix of former advisers of President Barack Obama, close confidants, long-time colleagues and former elected officials, reflects the sense of careful organization the Democratic candidate has aimed to project in her presidential campaign. But her Republican rival, Donald Trump, could seize on the group to make the point that she is part of the establishment he aims to defeat in November’s election, and to reiterate his charge that a Clinton administration would be an Obama “third term.” The group, which the Clinton campaign named on Tuesday and which will lay the groundwork for her to take charge quickly if she wins, is evidence of Clinton’s long experience in Washington as a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady. Transition teams aim to help the president-elect make key decisions during the period between the election and the inauguration, in this case from Nov. 8 to Jan. 20, so the new White House occupant can fill leadership posts quickly. “They are the names you would expect – people who have been advising her for a long time; people who have worked with her for a long time and people who are peers, who she respects,” Matt Bennett of the moderate Democratic group Third Way said of Clinton’s transition team.  The group will be headed by Ken Salazar, a former interior secretary and U.S. senator. He will lead four co-chairs: former Obama national security adviser Tom Donilon; former Obama aide Neera Tanden, who now leads the progressive think tank the Center for American Progress; former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm and Maggie Williams, the director of Harvard’s Institute of Politics. Heather Boushey, the executive director of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, will be the chief economist. Two additional policy advisers from Clinton’s campaign, Ed Meier and Ann O’Leary, will also move full-time to the transition team, the campaign said in a statement. The transition team does not necessarily reflect future policy. “The job here is to give options, not just say there is one policy course you want to take,” said Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, who advised the presidential campaigns of Al Gore and John Kerry. Clinton would be the first woman elected to the U.S. presidency and Shrum said Clinton’s team “has got to be the first transition team in history where the majority of its members are women.” Shrum added that Clinton is largely following Obama’s template as he prepared for his transition after the 2008 election. Tanden, who played a key role in shaping Obama’s health care overhaul, is a member of Clinton’s tight-knit inner circle, and has also worked for her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Williams was the 1992 transition director for Clinton when she became first lady, and then her chief of staff in the White House. Clinton worked closely with Donilon when she led the State Department from 2009-2013. Granholm, the former governor, is also a former state attorney general and has years of experience in Democratic politics. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee applauded the selection of O’Leary and Boushey, praising their economic positions. The environmental group Greenpeace criticized Salazar for not curbing fracking in his home state of Colorado. The announcement of the team came as Clinton has gained momentum in the opinion polls, with the current RealClearPolitics average of national polls showing her 6.7 points ahead, at 47.7 percent to Trump’s 41 percent.  Trump’s campaign has struggled after he made a string of controversial remarks since formally winning his party’s nomination last month. More establishment Republicans, alarmed by Trump’s inability or unwillingness to rein in his provocative remarks, have distanced themselves from the candidate in recent weeks. The Wall Street Journal, a leading conservative voice, said in an editorial on Monday that he should fix his campaign in the next three weeks or hand over to his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Trump, a New York businessman who has never held elected office, picked New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to head his transition team in May. ",politicsNews,"August 16, 2016 ",0

 WATCH: Republican Lawmaker Claims Forcing Women To Have Babies Will Help The Economy,"This maniac wants  The Handmaid s Tale  to become reality.Abortion is protected by the constitution in this country. But a Wisconsin lawmaker thinks that women should be forced to get pregnant and give birth.Wisconsin state GOP Rep. Scott Allen made the horrendous remarks while criticizing a bill that would block state employees from covering abortion with their health insurance.Because he doesn t think the bill goes far enough.Seriously.Allen pitched his idea to force women to give birth, and tried to justify his idea by claiming that forcing women to give birth will somehow help the economy. Labor force shortages are tied to population declines. Labor force shortages are a limiting factor in economic growth. Limited economic growth poses a problem when government tries to pay for public services and infrastructure. In spite of this Mr. Speaker, ironically, the Democrats continue their efforts to support the abortion industry. See what he did there? Allen claims that forcing women to give birth against their will is good for the economy. I m sure he would say the same thing about slavery, too.Here s the video via Twitter.Your #saturdaymorning WTF:WI Rep. Scott Allen says women should be made to give birth for the good of the economy.?pic.twitter.com/db01mkLQMl  Holly O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) November 4, 2017Allen is, of course, wrong. The fact is that there are millions of Americans who are currently unemployed. There are more people in this country than there are jobs. More people will not solve the economic problems we face today. And if women are forced to have babies, it will only make the problem worse, especially among teens. Teen girls who get pregnant and have babies are at an economic disadvantage. Many are forced to drop out of school and forgo college, making it more difficult for them to get high-paying jobs.The lack of child care services in this country also makes it difficult for women to work and take care of their children at the same time.The cost of raising children is incredibly expensive now, and most people are struggling to get by as it is. More kids will just add more struggle and stress. This country has a sufficient labor force. The problem is that businesses would rather hire what amounts to slave laborers overseas. Wages are also too low, which prevents most people from sparking economic growth through spending. If all workers can do with the little money they get is pay bills, it leaves very little left to spend at area businesses.In the end, forcing women to have kids is unconstitutional and will do nothing to grow the economy. Forcing big business to pay worker a livable wage, however, will turn the economy into the powerhouse it once was.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"November 6, 2017",1
Philadelphia Fox affiliate suspends TV host for Conway remark: media," (Editors Note: Attention to language that may be offensive to some readers in paragraph two) By Laila Kearney (Reuters) - A Fox-affiliated Philadelphia morning show host has been suspended after using a word considered offensive on live television to describe the Trump administration’s Kellyanne Conway, local media reported on Thursday. Good Day Philadelphia’s Mike Jerrick was discussing Conway’s use of the term “alternative facts” on Tuesday with co-host Alex Holley and guests when he said the Trump aide was “good at bullshit.” The group laughed at the remark before Holley apologized to the show’s audience. Jerrick, who did not appear on Fox 29’s “Good Day” on Wednesday or Thursday, has been suspended from the show for an indefinite period, Philadelphia Magazine reported, citing the host. Jerrick and Conway could not immediately be reached for comment. Fox Television Stations said in a statement that it had addressed the incident, but it offered no details. “This is not in line with FOX Television Stations guidelines,” the statement said. A spokeswoman with the broadcast group declined to say whether Jerrick had been suspended. Jerrick, who has also hosted the nationally syndicated Fox talk show “The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet,” wrote on Instagram late on Wednesday: “Night off. Why not. Always a good fight.” The post was followed by more than 150 comments, some from people who said they would boycott Fox until Jerrick’s return. The “alternative facts” remark drew widespread criticism on social media and has been credited with a spike in sales of George Orwell’s “1984” novel about a dystopian future where people are forced to simultaneously accept contradictory versions of the truth. Conway was responding to accusations that the Trump administration was fixated on the size of his inauguration crowds, saying: “We feel compelled to go out and clear the air and put alternative facts out there.” ",politicsNews,"January 26, 2017 ",0
Czech PM designate: EU should not push us over migrants - paper,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - The designated Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said that the European Union should not push Czechs over their refusal to shelter asylum-seekers, because it could strengthen extremist parties in the country. The European Union s executive will sue Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in the bloc s top court for their refusal to host asylum-seekers, Brussels said on Thursday. Babis, whose government is due to be appointed by President Milos Zeman on Dec. 13, repeated his country s stance on migrants.  The (European) Commission can withdraw the charge at any moment. We have to negotiate on this and to offer different models, like guarding the borders or help to other countries. But we don t want any refugees,  Babis said in an interview published on Saturday by the Pravo daily paper.  He will represent his country at the EU summit on Dec. 14 and Dec. 15, where European leaders will discuss migration. The Czechs have declined to shelter asylum-seekers despite an overall drop in arrivals due to tighter borders and projects beyond the EU s frontiers to discourage migration to Europe. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) cases could lead to financial penalties but may take months, or years, to conclude. Babis said that by pushing on with the case, the EU might embolden extremist elements.  The EU has to understand, that if it won t listen to our proposals, then the influence of extremist parties like (Germany s) AfD or (Czech) SPD will grow, whose strategy actually is to destroy the EU,  he said. Despite his ANO party winning the parliamentary election by a landslide in October, it is unclear whether Babis will be able to win a confidence vote for his government by mid-January as required by the constitution. He also faces the threat of prosecution in connection with his business interests. The far-right, anti-EU and anti-NATO SPD party and the Communists have lent ANO support in several initial votes in parliament in return for committee posts for their members, raising the prospect that they may have some kind of agreement to back ANO. But Babis reiterated in the Pravo interview that there was no deal in place and he would talk to all parties to either back the cabinet or abstain from the vote to help ANO win.

" The Democratic Party Has Never Done This Before, And It’s A Big Victory For Human Rights","The draft version of the Democratic Party platform released on Friday evening contains a provision pushing for an end to the death penalty in America. It is something the party has never done before, even though it has fielded candidates opposed to the criminal punishment.Progressives are rightly pointing it out as a considerable move in the right direction.The latest draft of the party s platform, released Friday, says the death penalty  has proven to be a cruel and unusual form of punishment  that  has no place in the United States of America. The inclusion of the provision represents a victory of sorts for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders   a longtime opponent of the punishment who has said he is remaining in the presidential race in order to fight for progressive causes.Sanders offered mild praise for the platform Friday evening, tweeting,  The Democratic Platform includes some accomplishments that will begin to move this country in the right direction. The party platform is not binding, and presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton has not completely come out against the penalty. During the primary debates, Clinton said she believed it had  very limited use  in the case of the most extreme crimes, like terrorist attacks similar to 9/11.The inclusion of anti-death penalty language continues the forward momentum seen over the last few years in which several states have banned the practice.The United States is only one of 36 countries in the world that still has capital punishment. It is banned in 103 countries, and in another 50 countries it has not been used for 10 years while still remaining on the books.Executions have been trending downwards in America over the last few years. In 2009, 52 people were executed, dropping to 35 in 2014 and 28 in 2015. So far in 2016, 14 people have been executed in the United States with the most recent being Earl Forrest on May 11, 2016 in Missouri. Forrest killed two people in a drug dispute, then killed a sheriff s deputy in an ensuing shootout.Featured image via Flickr",News,"July 1, 2016",1
 Trump Just Gave The Most BIZARRE Response For How He’ll Defeat ISIS (VIDEO),"Audience members and viewers watching MSNBC s  Commander-in-Chief Forum  were treated to a rare, once-in-a-lifetime moment last night when Donald Trump actually told the truth for a few seconds about his  plan  to defeat ISIS.Host and moderator Matt Lauer had been grilling the Republican nominee on the insanity he s been spewing about having a secret plan to defeat ISIS that he can t reveal (supposedly because it would just tip-off the terrorist group). While Trump has previously been quick to find creative ways to dodge or turn around questions in a way that confuses people and avoids having to actually provide an answer, The Donald slipped up this time. By complete accident, Trump revealed that regardless of what he s said in the past, there is no plan at all.In trying to clarify a contradictory statement that Trump had made in a speech earlier that day in which Trump had said he d give military leaders 30 days to devise a plan to defeat ISIS, Lauer asked Trump: So, is the plan you ve been hiding this whole time asking someone else for their plan? Trump stumbled over this question right away, unintentionally showing Americans that Trump has yet to come up with a strategy: No. But when I do come up with a plan that I like, and that perhaps agrees with mine   or maybe doesn t   I may love what the generals come back with Lauer continued to question Trump about releasing the plan, and criticized him for taking a plan from  generals    even though Trump has previously said that he knows more about ISIS than they do. This part of the interview was completely bizarre as Trump loses his footing and Lauer knew the Republican nominee was vulnerable   but it was perfect. Trump was finally being exposed for the liar he is.You can watch this part of the interview below:Is Donald Trump s counterterrorism plan to ask for someone else s plan? #NBCNewsForumhttps://t.co/A5IN7J9S9l  MSNBC (@MSNBC) September 8, 2016Featured image via Spencer Platt / Getty Images",News,"September 8, 2016",1
MUSLIM WOMAN ARRESTED FOR SPITTING ON HER FELLOW WHITE WALMART SHOPPERS BUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS MORE UPSETTING,"This woman s having trouble entering the Walmart so people go to help her SHE SPITS ON THEM! Her reasoning for this disgusting behavior is that  Americans are pushing us around . She s arrested BUT what happens next is what s so disturbing.A Saudi Arabian national faces hate crimes charges after allegedly spitting on several people at a Florida Walmart.Nuha Mohammed Al-Doaifi was arrested in Palm Bay after police responded to a 911 call, Florida Today reported Tuesday.The 21-year-old, who was with her 2-year-old son at the time, allegedly admitted to authorities she spat on several people because  Americans are pushing us around. The incident began, police said, when a woman approached Al-Doaifi when she appeared to be having difficulty entering the Walmart. All I was trying to do was tell her she was coming in through the out door,  Terry Rakowski told Florida Today.  She was just ramming (her cart) into the door. The 39-year-old then claims the woman spat in her face. She just spit all over me,  she said.Al-Doaifi then allegedly did the same thing to several others inside the Walmart. Her actions were directed at random people based on their ethnicity, and that s according to her own statement,  said a spokeswoman for the Palm Bay Police Department.BUT THIS IS WHAT S EVEN MORE DISTURBING:Don t bother trying to hit the link to the original source  Florida Today . As soon as this story started to appear at other websites they yanked the story, scrubbed it completely. You can t even find the original report by searching for this woman s name, all you get is a 404  page not found. It s like it never happened and she doesn t exist.Apparently, hate crimes is a one way street, especially when committed by a Muslim against white folks.You have to wonder why she s even here if she hates white Americans so much. The next question is whether the Obama regime will deport her back to the big sandbox from whence she came.I m gonna say, probably not.VIA: BLUR BRAIN",politics,"Apr 1, 2015",1
Argentina's head prosecutor resigns under government pressure,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina s top prosecutor quit on Monday under pressure from the government over accusations that she hampered corruption investigations into officials from the previous administration of President Cristina Fernandez.  Alejandra Gils Carbo, whose resignation will take effect on Dec. 31, was appointed chief prosecutor during populist Fernandez s second term and stayed in the post under business-oriented President Mauricio Macri. Macri, in office since late 2015, accused Gils Carbo of failing to bring corruption charges against members of Fernandez s cabinet. Gils Carbo is herself the focus of a corruption investigation cantering on her tenure as lead prosecutor. She has denied corruption allegations. At a press conference in July, Macri described Gils Carbo as a  political activist  who misused her power as attorney general.  After repeatedly calling for her resignation, Macri s government began a campaign for reforms that would allow for Gils Carbo s firing, which ultimately prompted her to step down. In her resignation letter, Gils Carbo told Macri she was concerned that his actions would end up hurting state institutions by  significantly affecting the autonomy of the public prosecutor s office.  Gils Carbo resigned one week after a powerful minister from the Fernandez era was arrested following a vote in Congress that stripped him of his parliamentary immunity in two corruption cases. The former minister, Julio De Vido, is the most powerful official from the Fernandez administration to be jailed. Macri s coalition was empowered by midterm elections on Oct. 22, and he has pledged more reforms. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",0
 Trump Uses Eric Garner’s Dying Words To Mock Mitt Romney; His Supporters Roar With Laughter,"Republican front-runner Donald Trump decided a visit to New York would be a good time to try out his comedy routine by delivering a stunningly tasteless joke at the expense of a man who had been recently killed nearby by New York police.In a performance that recalled the time he mocked a physically disabled reporter, Trump cast his arch-nemesis Mitt Romney in the role of police brutality victim Eric Garner because, as Trump tells it, both were known for  choking. Unbelievable. The last election should have been won, except Romney choked like a dog. He choked,  Trump said, before mocking Romney with his hands in a choke position.Trump shouted  I can t breathe, I can t breathe,  mocking the last words of Garner, who died in police custody on July 17, 2014, when officers tried to arrest him for allegedly selling loose, untaxed cigarettes across from Tompkinsville Park.The moment stunned reporters on scene, but what was perhaps even more surprising was the response Trump got from his fans. Rather than find the idea of aping the words of a man who recently died just a few miles away repulsive, the crowd of Trump-heads roared with laughter. The mockery was the funniest thing they had ever seen.'Like a dog': Donald Trump impersonates Mitt Romney 'choking' in the 2012 election https://t.co/dX9r9HADCA pic.twitter.com/Ny7ULsOIhW  Business Insider (@businessinsider) April 12, 2016Like every offensive thing Trump does, this may have been a finely-tuned tactical maneuver. For many in New York, the story of Eric Garner s senseless death is still raw and infuriating, but the small but vocal Fox News crowd has always taken a different opinion on it. In the aftermath of Garner s death, Fox repeatedly booked guests who pushed the idea that Garner deserved it.Neil Cavuto and guest Bishop E.W. Jackson concluded as much: It s the result of a young man having made the decision to resist arrest. And when you do that, things are not going to end well. It s tragic, it s terrible. But how about teaching the young people when the police make a request, cooperate with them rather than resisting them? Rudy Guliani   also on Fox News   agreed, claiming Garner killed himself by struggling to not be arrested.Many of the people who felt the same, now attend Trump rallies where they count on the candidate to stoke racial fears and push the kind of xenophobic nationalism that s gotten him so far with the Republican base. Mocking Eric Garner   and linking him to Romney, whom Trump views as weak and pathetic   is a way of playing on feelings of white pride that enthralls many of Trump s fans.Featured image via Twitter",News,"April 13, 2016",1
 Republican Governor Is Letting Employers Ignore Minimum Wage Increase Passed By Voters,"If this becomes a Republican strategy across the country, the American people will suffer greatly.Maine voters approved state minimum wage increase to $9 an hour earlier this year by a 10 point margin. That s means the state government must honor the will of the people and punish any employer that doesn t comply with the law.But Governor Paul LePage is opening the door for employers to openly ignore and defy the law, which sets a dangerous precedent that Republicans will likely employ around the nation in order to get around the minimum wage laws they hate.The strategy is simple, just don t enforce the law and let employers treat employees like slaves.And that s what LePage is toying with as he tests his strategy out for the next month.According to an announcement by the Tea Party governor,From Jan. 7, 2017, when the new minimum wage law is scheduled to go into effect, and until Jan. 31, 2017, the department will not bring enforcement actions against any employer who fails to comply with the change in the tip credit or the minimum salary requirement for overtime-exempt workers. Employers are expected to follow the law and pay the minimum hourly wage of $9.In short, when the law takes effect on January 7th, employers can ignore it at least until January 31st. That is, unless LePage decides to extend the length of the time-period, which he could do since he s an asshole.And this could end up becoming a strategy used by other Republicans in other states and even at the federal level since Donald Trump and the GOP control the government, including the Justice Department and the Labor Department.Mainers for Fair Wages campaign manager Amy Halsted blasted LePage for defying the voters and every hardworking person who desperately needs the wage increase. Governor LePage has now gone beyond ignoring the will of Maine voters and is flat-out encouraging employers to commit wage theft,  she said.  Refusing to enforce the minimum wage law, and especially the increase in the base wage for tipped workers from $3.75 to $5 an hour, is a slap in the face to tens of thousands of Mainers who are working hard and too often struggling to afford heat, food and medicine. But LePage doesn t care. In fact, he accused supporters of the minimum wage increase of  attempted murder  and said they should be put in prison. To me, when you go out and kill somebody, you go to jail,  he said.  Well, this is attempted murder in my mind because it is pushing people to the brink of survival. You know what really pushes people to the brink of survival? Not paying them enough to provide themselves with basic human needs like food, clothes, healthcare, and shelter. If anyone should be behind bars it s politicians like LePage and the greedy rich people who oppose raising the minimum wage.At some point, you can only trod over the masses for so long before they snap. Anger and desperation will boil over and the bottom line is that the working poor outnumber the wealthy few so they would be wise to take care of the people who work long hours for far less pay to help make them rich.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"December 27, 2016",1
Trump's 'bromance' with Russia's Putin appears to be cooling,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With his administration on the defensive over investigations into alleged Russian meddling in last year’s election, U.S. President Donald Trump is no longer tweeting praise for his Kremlin counterpart. Less than five weeks after he took office, the chances of a spring thaw in relations between Washington and Moscow – once buoyed by an apparent “bromance” between Trump and President Vladimir Putin during the U.S. political campaign – are looking much dimmer, U.S. officials say. His top foreign policy advisers have started talking tougher on Russia, and the apparent cooling of Trump’s approach follows the resignation last month of his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, a vocal advocate of warmer ties with Moscow. He was replaced by Army Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, who is more hawkish on Russia and allied with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general. In one other sign of a stiffening attitude, two officials said the administration had offered the job of top Russia adviser at the National Security Council to Russia scholar Fiona Hill, a leading Putin critic. Her books include “Mr. Putin, Operative in the Kremlin”, an allusion to the Russian leader’s past as a KGB officer. It was not immediately known whether she had accepted the post.  Pressure also has come to bear from Trump’s fellow Republicans in Congress, long wary of his campaign overtures to Putin, and from European allies anxious over any sign that the president might prematurely ease sanctions imposed on Russia after its annexation of Crimea and support for pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine. Posing fresh obstacles to rapprochement with Russia, analysts say, is mounting evidence that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and other members of Trump’s team communicated with Russian officials during and after the presidential campaign. The mushrooming inquiry - which is now focused on Sessions and his contacts with Moscow’s ambassador to Washington - has fueled calls for expanded investigations into allegations that Moscow sought to sway the election’s outcome. “There is so much panic in the U.S. political establishment over Russia right now that Trump will be boxed in on what he can do,” said Matthew Rojansky, a Russia expert at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington. White House officials say there were no improper contacts, and Russia denies any meddling. While Trump has yet to lay down his Russia policy, most signs suggest no swift changes in the relationship, which sank to a post-Cold War low under his predecessor Barack Obama, mostly due to bitter differences over Syria and Ukraine. Mattis sought to reassure NATO allies during a visit to Europe last month, telling them there would be no military cooperation between the United States and Russia in the near future. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley this week denounced Russia for casting a veto to protect the Syrian government from Security Council action over accusations of chemical weapons use, and also recently insisted the United States would not recognize Russia’s seizure of Crimea. Trump’s openness to closer ties to Russia and his emphasis, particularly during the campaign, on fighting terrorism sparked concerns among current and former U.S. officials that he might trade away U.S. interests in other areas in exchange for military and intelligence cooperation against groups such as Islamic State. Trump’s language on Russia now has shifted somewhat from campaign days, when he tweeted his admiration for Putin as a strong leader, and the Russian president paid him compliments. Trump told a news conference in mid-February that, “I would love to be able to get along with Russia,” but added that, “It’s possible I won’t be able to get along with Putin.”     Two senior European officials this week told reporters in Washington they discerned an evolution in the Trump administration’s stance toward Russia, saying there appeared to be no desire to engage in such a “grand bargain” in which, for example, Ukraine-related sanctions might be eased in return for Russian action on other issues.     “What we consider reassuring is that, at least during our meetings, nobody came with this idea of a grand bargain, with the idea of a big deal,” said one senior European official on condition of anonymity.     Said a second senior European official: “Vis-a-vis Russia, to be frank I have the impression that the analysis and the positions of this administration are probably now closer to our position than (they) may have been two or three months ago.”  Recent Russian actions have created new complications, including a stepped-up offensive by pro-Russian separatist forces in eastern Ukraine and what the Pentagon described as the bombing this week by Russian and Syrian aircraft of U.S.-backed Syrian rebels – something Moscow denied had happened. For its part, the Kremlin said on Wednesday it was patiently waiting for “some kind of actions” from the Trump administration so that it could understand what the future holds for relations. “We have heard different statements from President Trump,” Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesman, told reporters. U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican member of the Foreign Relations Committee and former 2016 presidential candidate, had words of caution for Trump about future dealings with Putin. “We have had two presidents - a Republican and a Democrat - previous to the current president who thought they could do such a deal with Vladimir Putin,” he said on the Senate floor on Wednesday. “Both of them fell on their face because they did not  understand what they were dealing with. It is my sincerest hope that our current President doesn’t make the same mistakes,” Rubio said. (This version of the story corrects defense secretary’s first name, paragraph 3.)

 This Incredibly Powerful Statement From A Teen Survivor Of A School Shooting Can’t Be Missed,"When we think of school shootings, we often think of those directly involved   the dead, the wounded, the people who saw the gunman s face. Desiree Palmer was not in the room at Marysville-Pilchuk High School in Washington, when freshman Jaylen Fryberg stormed into the school cafeteria and shot five other students, killing four, before fatally shooting himself. But she, along with an entire community, felt the impact.Desiree s story was brought to my attention by none other than Montel Williams. Williams, a proud, gun-owning conservative, recently said that he watched President Obama outline his plan to ease the suffering in this country by taking executive action on firearms   not, of course, by stripping ownership from law-abiding citizens as the NRA and its acolytes fear, but through a series of common-sense reforms.While some cling to the idea that any reform is a sign that Obama is coming for their guns, Williams takes a more reasonable stance, as he explained via Facebook: I m a proud, responsible gun owner and we ought to be the LOUDEST voices for universal background checks, for keeping guns away from criminals and the mentally ill. That is how to be a proud steward of the  # 2a right I and so many others hold dear. If I thought for a minute the goal was to take my guns, I d oppose it,  Williams told his inevitable detractors.  I m a law abiding American   nothing to fear. I think the corollary to effective background checks is to make it EASIER and more streamlined for law abiding folks to get guns. Truly responsible gun owners, Williams says, support common-sense reforms.The talk show legend told Addicting Info that Palmer s story helped him form his opinions, that reading her words sherpad him to the conclusion that something has to be done:We agree that Palmer s words need to be read by all. Though she was not in the cafeteria she felt the loss, lived through the terror, and still struggles to cope with the terror of that day. While it might be easy to assume that the suffering begins and ends with the victims and their families, when violence occurs it hurts everyone around.In it, you will see the strength of a young woman who knows a fear many (or most) do not  the fear that someone she knows, a loved one, a friend might pick up a gun. That friends will die far too young. That life will never be normal again.I think it is safe to say that I have always been a pretty fearful person. I am afraid of failure, displeasing people, not doing the right thing; but I have never been afraid of the actual world, until now. October 24th will be a day I always remember because it has challenged almost everything that I believe in. I wasn t in the cafeteria and I wasn t close to the ones we lost. Yet still, I am not okay. And I hate the response I have been getting by admitting that. People say,  well, you weren t even in there so why do you still let it bother you?  I seriously asked myself that question for the longest time until I realized that I am allowed to feel how I feel. I feel weird, abnormal, dysfunctional, incapable, unsocial, exhausted, broken, and weak. But I also feel nothing at all.I go to school and watch everyone pretend like things are normal.I go to school and pretend things are normal.And I am so sick of it.It has been 90 days since the shooting and it seems like things are almost worse than ever Behind closed doors, that is. I think all of us realize it, but think we are too crazy to actually believe that MAYBE it is acceptable for us to still be in pain. Teachers avoid the subject because it s uncomfortable and parents avoid it because they don t know what to say. Everyone avoids it because they think they are alone.I am asking this for myself and my peers at Marysville-Pilchuck: please, someone, say something.Say something besides  It s time to get back to work! We have tests in May! Say something besides  We have to move on  or  You ll get through it .We need to hear,  It s okay to not be okay right now , because a lot of us don t think it is.It is so frustrating to be in an environment that settles for the worst just because one horrible thing has happened. The most common thing I see in my community is the mindset that horrible things are going to happen and we just have to let them. Some days I am too tired to deal with the emotions, but most days, I m just pissed off. We all need to heal, but letting fear hinder our ability to create the good things again is not helping. We have had enough taken away from us.I have a dream at least once a week that involves me being the target of a shooting at my school. Often times, one of my peers is the one holding the gun I think that is what scares me the most. This time, it wasn t some  bad guy  or stranger, it was a friend to many and a family member. I can t help but think that my dreams represent my newly-born fear of trusting other people.I guess you just never really know these days.I have been trying to write this post for about 2   months. Every few weeks, I go back and read what I had said the last time I wrote. Each time, I try to finish it, but never do. When I started, it was November 22nd. I explained what I went through on that day from beginning to end. The second entry, was right before Christmas and at that point, I was just sad. It s scary to watch myself explain how I have reached acceptance of reality, and then a few short weeks later, describe how I am absolutely falling apart. I have never been so confused in my entire life.To be honest, I still don t really know what I am trying to accomplish by writing this. Maybe someone will read it and know they aren t the only one who feels like they re just going through the motions every day. My hope isn t that you understand me, it s that I start to.Today I am angry and fearful.Angry that the world is the way it is, and fearful of the same thing.Desiree PalmerMarysville-Pilchuck High School studentIt s easy to get lost in the debate over whether or not it is worth it to enact gun legislation. After all, we often hear that  criminals don t care about gun laws    or, from more callous individuals, that  your dead kids don t trump my Constitutional rights. Lives lost in school shootings are not the  price of freedom  as we often hear. They are future doctors, lawyers, musicians, artists, police, and more. They are our future, which we see stripped away with every bullet fired as a result of our lack of action. Each time this comes up, we are fed the excuse that common-sense reforms like background checks might not have stopped the last massacre, or the one before that, or the one before that, so why bother trying,  the President said of his planned reforms.  I reject that thinking. We know we can t stop every act of violence, every act of evil in the world. But maybe we could try to stop one act of evil, one act of violence,  Obama said   and he s right. If expanded background checks and other reasonable reforms can stop a single act of violence or save a single life, then they are worth it. Period.Featured image via KIRO7",News,"January 6, 2016",1
FBI investigated over pre-election decisions on Clinton email,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday said it would probe a Federal Bureau of Investigation decision to announce an inquiry into Hillary Clinton’s emails shortly before the November presidential election, a move she has blamed as a factor in her defeat. The Justice Department’s Office of Inspector General said in a statement that its investigation would focus in part on decisions leading up to public statements by FBI Director James Comey regarding the Clinton investigation and whether they may have been based on “improper considerations.” The controversy involved Clinton’s use of a private email server for official correspondence when she was secretary of state under President Barack Obama, including for messages that were later determined to contain classified information.      The office of Inspector General Michael Horowitz said it decided to open the review “in response to requests from numerous chairmen and ranking members of congressional oversight committees, various organizations and members of the public.” Although the FBI ultimately decided not to refer Clinton’s case for prosecution, Democrats said Comey’s announcement damaged her with voters right before the election, and he faced complaints that his moves were politically motivated. Law enforcement authorities, including the FBI, by custom do not disclose information about investigations that do not end in criminal charges.   If the review finds evidence of misconduct, any officials involved would be referred for disciplinary action.  In a statement, Comey said the FBI would cooperate fully and he was “grateful” to Horowitz for the probe.  “He is professional and independent and ... I hope very much he is able to share his conclusions and observations with the public because everyone will benefit from thoughtful evaluation and transparency regarding this matter.” Brian Fallon, Clinton’s spokesman, told MSNBC on Thursday that Comey’s actions “cried out for an independent review.” Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the U.S. Senate said Comey’s statements were not “fair, professional or consistent with the policies of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.”   President-elect Donald Trump, who will be sworn in Jan. 20, will not have the power to dismiss the probe. But federal law permits U.S. presidents to dismiss inspectors general for federal agencies, as long as the president provides Congress a written justification for the removal 30 days in advance.  Often leading crowds in chants of “lock her up!” during the election campaign, Trump as a candidate repeatedly accused Clinton of illegal conduct over the emails. In a debate in October, he vowed she would “be in jail” over the matter if he became president, but he has since said he would not pursue prosecution. PRE-ELECTION ANNOUNCEMENT  Comey publicly announced the status of the agency’s investigation into Clinton’s emails two times in 2016.  In July, Comey held a press conference and testified before Congress to explain why the FBI had decided not to refer Clinton for prosecution, explaining that she was “extremely careless” but should not be charged with gross negligence or any other federal crime.  In October, less than two weeks before the Nov. 8 election, Comey sent members of Congress a letter saying the FBI was resuming the investigation because of new emails found on the computer of disgraced former Representative Anthony Weiner, the husband of one of Clinton’s top aides. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch had informed Comey the day before he sent the letter that doing so would conflict with official Justice Department guidance that instructs employees to “never select the timing of investigative steps ... for the purpose of affecting any election.” Comey asked whether he was being explicitly directed not to send the letter, and Lynch never gave Comey the order not to do so, a senior government official told Reuters at the time. On Nov. 6, Comey said the investigation into Weiner’s computer produced no new evidence that would incriminate Clinton.     Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, on Thursday commended Horowitz for opening the probe.  “Conspicuously absent, though, is any specific reference to the attorney general’s failure to recuse herself from the probe, particularly after her meeting with former President (Bill) Clinton,” said Grassley in a statement. That half-hour meeting, which took place in June on board Lynch’s plane while it was parked on the tarmac in Phoenix, drew criticism that Lynch was politically biased and unfit to oversee the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server. Critics of Comey’s decisions also said he could be in violation of the Hatch Act, a 1939 law that bars government employees from interfering with U.S. elections. ",politicsNews,"January 12, 2017 ",0
Hundreds march in Sydney for asylum seekers ahead of PNG camp closure,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Hundreds of protesters marched through Sydney on Sunday to call for detainees, being held in controversial centers for asylum seekers on remote Pacific islands, to be allowed to stay in Australia as a resettlement deadline approaches. Canberra s hardline immigration policy requires asylum seekers intercepted at sea to be sent for processing to two remote Pacific locations - one on Papua New Guinea s (PNG s) Manus Island and the other on the Micronesian island nation of Nauru. They are told they will never be settled in Australia. The Manus center is to be closed on Oct. 31 when detainees who have had their refugee applications rejected will be resettled in PNG. Protesters led by socialists and refugee advocates in Sydney said the detainees should be resettled in Australia.  Nobody is free on Manus,  said Refugee Action Coalition Sydney spokesman Ian Rintoul on Sunday.  It will be like Nauru, a prison island.  Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish journalist detained on Manus, said in a Facebook post on Friday that the detainees do not want to be resettled in PNG as they cannot work or provide for their families there and they do not feel safe. The office of Australia s immigration minister, Peter Dutton, could not be immediately reached for a comment. Former U.S. President Barack Obama late last year agreed to resettle up to 1,250 asylum seekers held in PNG and Nauru. In exchange, Australia agreed to take Central American refugees.

FORMER SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER Goes Low…Calls Two Republicans ‘A–holes’,"What s gotten into John Boehner? He gave a strange interview to left-leaning Politico and unloaded on former colleagues. During the interview he claimed he held no grudges against his former colleagues yet he called a few of them  a holes . Was he drunk? He also got into it on twitter with Sean Hannity and Hannity shot back questioning whether Boehner had been drinking Perhaps Hannity is on to something.John were you sober when you said this? That conversation never happened. I m sorry you are bitter and u failed! https://t.co/SLquw7rXZv  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 30, 2017Boehner gave a lengthy interview and even went after other conservative talk radio hosts: I always liked Rush. When I went to Palm Beach, I would always meet with Rush and we d go play golf. But you know, who was that right-wing guy, Levin? He went really crazy right and got a big audience, and he dragged Hannity to the dark side. He dragged Rush to the dark side. And these guys   I used to talk to them all the time. And suddenly they re beating the living s  out of me. TRUE COLORS?Why is John Boehner suddenly attacking his fellow Republicans? Jordan is a valued member of Congress and isn t a RINO so maybe Boehner has it out for him.Former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said in a new profile from Politico on Sunday that Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and former Rep. Jason Chaffetz(R-Utah) are  a holes. The former speaker made the comment while discussing Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) likely becoming the chair of the House Oversight Committee, a position Gowdy eventually earned.Chaffetz, the previous chair, had recently announced his resignation from Congress at the time of the interview. Jordan, who was also on the committee, was reportedly considering going out for the chairmanship. Gowdy   that s my guy, even though he doesn t know how to dress,  John Boehner told Politico.  F  Jordan. F  Chaffetz. They re both a holes. Boehner also called Chaffetz a  total phony  who was obsessed with promoting himself while in Congress. With Chaffetz it s always about Chaffetz,  Boehner told Politico.Chaffetz resigned from Congress in June and joined Fox News as a contributor.Boehner also criticized Jordan, who helped found the House s Freedom Caucus, which was part of the movement to push Boehner out as speaker: Jordan was a terrorist as a legislator going back to his days in the Ohio House and Senate,  Boehner told Politico.  A terrorist. A legislative terrorist. Last July, Boehner also spoke out against Jordan:Former House Speaker John Boehner assailed GOP House arch conservatives led by Rep. Jim Jordan as the  knucklehead caucus,  calling them  anarchists  who are  for nothing. In a speech from a private gathering in Las Vegas casino/resort, the West Chester Republican took aim at the conservatives who pushed him from office at the end of 2015. Among those was Jordan, R-Urbana, who revolted against Boehner, even though he was the first speaker from Ohio since Republican Nicholas Longworth in 1931.Boehner was asked to explain why House Republicans did not support House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., to succeed Boehner as speaker. The knucklehead caucus decided they weren t going to vote for him,  Boehner said.  Now these are the guys in the Republican Party you could call right of right. They are anarachists. They re for nothing. The video of Boehner was obtained by The Washington Post. Although he did not mention Jordan by name, it was clear Boehner was referring to him.Read more: The Hill",politics,"Oct 30, 2017",1
 America’s Stepdad Tim Kaine Just Burned Trump HARD On Colbert,"Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Tim Kaine spent his Thursday evening with Late Show host Stephen Colbert, and of course eventually the conversation turned to the absolutely destructive force that is the Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump. The first element of Trump s many outrageous statements to be discussed was his absurd description of Trump calling Kaine s running mate Hillary Clinton a bigot. Kaine reminded the audience the difference between the two candidates  records regarding America s race troubles: When Hillary Clinton got out of law school, she was working to help advance racial justice in the juvenile justice system in South Carolina and fight school segregation in Alabama, and I about that time got out of law school and was battling housing discrimination in the South and in Virginia. At his early career, Donald Trump was a real estate guy who got sued by the Justice Department for discriminating against people in housing (by) writing the letter C on applications if they were minority,  Kaine continued.  Hillary Clinton has got a track record all the way back to being a middle schooler in a Methodist youth group of trying to advance priorities for others   and Donald Trump s for himself. Kaine is right, of course. The contrast couldn t be more stark, and history speaks for itself. If anyone is the bigot in this scenario, it s Donald Trump, not Hillary Clinton.Briefly, Stephen Colbert turned to his and Kaine s shared faith, and asked Kaine to recite a New Testament verse he is fond of. Kaine responded with Philippians 2:3: Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind consider one another as more important than yourself. Colbert then cited  his own favorite verse in Latin. A backstage interview yielded more criticism of Trump from Kaine, when he said: This is fundamentally about the nation s promise of equality. If we are supposed to do a U-turn or not, so you got to take that seriously, and I m really glad she just reminded everybody that is what is at stake in November. Kaine says that if he ever gets to confront Trump, he d ask one simple question: How can you say the things you re saying? Kaine then continued  his final blistering blow: He is going around saying that the American military is a disaster, ridicules a Gold Star family, makes fun of John McCain because he was a POW   that kind of personality shouldn t be within 10 time zones of being commander-in-chief. So right, Senator Kaine, so right. Hopefully, people listen to you.Watch a clip below, via Raw Story:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"August 26, 2016",1
Uphill battle looms as Trump seeks revamped healthcare plan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, striving to make good on a top campaign promise, is pushing his fellow Republicans who control Congress to pass revamped healthcare legislation but the same intraparty squabbling that torpedoed it last month could do it again. Trump is looking for his first major legislative victory since taking office in January. House of Representatives Republicans are exploring compromises aimed at satisfying the party’s most conservative members without antagonizing its moderates, but it remained unclear on Friday whether a viable bill would emerge. Trump on Friday played down the need for Congress to act on the legislation before he reaches his 100th day in office next weekend, telling reporters, “We’ll see what happens - no particular rush.” Trump on Thursday had predicted “a good chance of getting it soon,” either “next week or shortly thereafter.” On Friday, he said it “doesn’t matter if it’s next week.” Congress, returning from a recess next week, also will be working against the clock to pass legislation to keep the government funded past April 28 and avert a federal shutdown. Healthcare legislation did not appear on the schedule released on Friday by House Republican leaders of bills to be considered next week. “We’re going to get it done when it’s appropriate in terms of getting to that 216,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters, referring to the vote total needed for House passage before the bill goes to the Senate. Trump’s party cannot afford defections because Democrats remain unified against the Republican quest to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement, dubbed Obamacare. Trump campaigned on a pledge to discard Obamacare. In a stinging setback for Trump, Speaker Paul Ryan pulled the legislation from the House floor on March 24 before allowing it to come to a vote amid a revolt by conservatives in a faction called the House Freedom Caucus and moderates unhappy with concessions to the conservatives. Republicans have called Obamacare a government overreach. The law enabled 20 million Americans to obtain insurance, many through an expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor. A senior House Republican aide said it was not clear whether a revamped Republican plan can attract 216 votes, adding that without a legislative text it was impossible to do a vote count to assess its chances. Moderate Republican Representative Tom MacArthur is pushing a proposal to allow states to waive some Obamacare provisions. MacArthur’s office said he has discussed it with other Republican lawmakers, the House leadership and the White House. No text has emerged, but an outline of his proposal said states could seek to relax “essential benefits” that Obamacare requires insurance plans to cover, such as emergency room trips, maternity and newborn care, and mental health services. States also could request waivers to Obamacare’s ban on insurers charging sick customers higher premiums than healthy customers. But states would have to establish “high-risk pools” using government funds to help pay for insurance for people with costly medical conditions. Representative Rodney Davis told CNN on Friday he did not know what was in the deal, but added, “I’m not going to be for a plan that is going to allow for pre-existing conditions to not be covered.” MacArthur and Davis are members of the centrist House Republican Tuesday Group. Freedom Caucus member Representative Dave Brat told CNN the new proposal gives states more say healthcare but was the “same fundamental bill” that collapsed last month. The Republican plan, as written last month, would end the Medicaid expansion, let states impose work requirements on some Medicaid recipients, rescind a range of Obamacare taxes, get rid of a penalty on people who refuse to obtain insurance, and ditch Obamacare’s income-based subsidies to help people buy insurance while creating less-generous age-based tax credits. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office forecast the earlier version of the plan would increase by 24 million the number of Americans without medical insurance by 2026. During a Thursday conference call with House Democrats, their leader, Nancy Pelosi, urged them to remain united against the Republican legislation, saying it would increase healthcare costs and provide less insurance coverage, an aide who was on the telephone call said.

WHAT TRUMP JUST SAID Should Scare All Gropers in Congress Who Settled Sex Assault Cases Using Taxpayer Dollars,"President Trump wants those who settled sexual harassment cases using our tax dollars to be exposed The House is responsible for the sexual assault slush fund that used our taxpayer money to pay off accusers. We should all call for this slush fund to be shut down This is NOT what our hard earned money should be paying for NEW: President Trump tells me he believe Congress should release the names of lawmakers who have settled sexual harassment claims  Trey Yingst (@TreyYingst) November 21, 2017The Transcript and video of Rep. Jackie Speier on  Face the Nation,  Nov. 19, 2017 is below. She spoke to John Dickerson and Chuck Todd before that about the $15 million in settlements for sexual harassment by congress members. Americans are furious that their tax dollars are being used in such a way WITHOUT the harasser being held accountable. These gropers should pay for this themselves!HERE S THE COMMENT FROM THE INTERVIEW BELOW THAT REALLY STANDS OUT:  we have a system in place that allows for the harasser to go unchecked. Doesn t pay for the settlement himself and is never identified. So the Office of Compliance to which a victim must apply or complain is a place that has really been an enabler of sexual harassment for these many years because of the way it s constructed.    REP JACKIE SPEIERRep. Jackie Speier, D-California, joined  Face the Nation  Sunday to discuss the fallout from the flood of sexual assault and harassment allegations across the U.S., and sexual harassment in Congress.JOHN DICKERSON: The debate over sexual harassment moved into the halls of Congress after California Democratic Congresswoman Jackie Speier went public with her own experience of unwanted sexual advances as a young Capitol Hill staffer. Speier s revelation actually inspired Leeann Tweeden to come forward with her allegations against Senator Franken.This week, Congresswoman Speier introduced legislation in the House aimed at fighting sexual harassment in Congress. And she joins us this morning from Palm Springs, California. Congresswoman, I want to start with something you wrote. You said that,  It s clear the good old boys club mentality of Capitol Hill still persists after all these years. It is perhaps the worst I ve seen in 30 years of working on these issues.  The old boys club was pretty bad. You re saying it s worse now?JACKIE SPEIER: Well, I think it s worse in part because we have a system in place that allows for the harasser to go unchecked. Doesn t pay for the settlement himself and is never identified. So the Office of Compliance to which a victim must apply or complain is a place that has really been an enabler of sexual harassment for these many years because of the way it s constructed.JOHN DICKERSON: As Congress and the larger culture tries to figure out what the standard is for treating accusers who come forward, something better than what has been where they ve been blocked, but also something that doesn t allow false accusations, how does that standard get determined, in your mind?JACKIE SPEIER: Well, first of all, we have to make sure that a complaint is taken seriously. And the person who is the victim is not somehow tortured or intimidated into not filing the complaint. That s what it is right now in Congress. There s a one month period where you re counseled. There s another month where you go through mandatory mediation and you have to sign a non disclosure agreement at the front end.And then you have a month of cooling off period. I mean, that is truly ridiculous. It s important for us to remember too, John, that over 90% of those who have been sexually harassed or sexually assaulted are telling the truth. So all these victims who have come forward with Roy Moore or with the president or with Al Franken, all of them have to be, we expect to believe them because, for the most part, they are telling the truth. There is no gain for them to come forward. There re lots of down sides, frankly.JOHN DICKERSON: What s your view about reevaluating the situation? You mentioned the president. The White House seems to suggest, and Senator Cotton also seemed to suggest that the voters knew about this. They voted for him. And so it s an issue that s in the past. How do you see it?JACKIE SPEIER: Well, I think there is some truth to that. If the president was running today, I bet he would not be elected because I think we have had a huge cultural shift that was 40 years in the making, but I think all of us are grateful now that there is a new day for women in the workplace, where they do not have to put up with sexual advances that are unwanted. That they do not have to live and work in a hostile work environment. And that s going to be good for all of us in the workplace.JOHN DICKERSON: As that cultural shift takes place, some people have argued, some Democrats and liberals have argued, that a reevaluation of Bill Clinton s presidency is required. What do you think about that in order to be clear about what the new standard is and use, you know, elements from the past that are well known?JACKIE SPEIER: Well, first of all, let s remember that he did face impeachment. It wasn t as if it was just tossed to the side. He faced impeachment. I think that the victims who came forward were not treated as they should have been. They should have been believed because, as I have pointed out, most people who come forward are telling the truth.JOHN DICKERSON: In the case of Al Franken, what s your feeling about that? There have been some columnists who ve written that basically again, liberals have said he must leave the Senate in order for Democrats to retain their credibility on this issue, or else they re open to the charge that Democrats apply it when it comes to Republicans, but are more generous when it comes to their own team.JACKIE SPEIER: I think it s appropriate for the ethics committee to do an investigation. Senator Franken has actually agreed to that as well. I also think that it has to be determined if there s a pattern of sexual harassment. Incidents have to be severe or they have to be ones that happen over a period of time. So I think we ll wait and see what the investigation determines.JOHN DICKERSON: Is that an instructive distinction then, pattern versus specific mistake in terms of what might penalize somebody but be the difference between penalizing and expulsion?JACKIE SPEIER: And that s what the Courts have held with sexual harassment cases. If there s a pattern, then sexual harassment is found to be in existence. If it s a one event and it s maybe a conversation versus, you know, sexual assault or an unwanted sexual advance, so it really depends on the circumstances in all of these cases.JOHN DICKERSON: Final question on a different topic, on taxes. Eleven of your Republican colleagues in California voted for the House tax cut bill in which deductibility of state and local taxes is no longer allowed. They were told- at least one of them was told,  Well, that ll get fixed later. And Californians who have high taxes will be able to deduct them.  What s your-do you believe that?JACKIE SPEIER: No, I don t believe it. And I think for all of those members who basically have handed their constituents a $10,000 tax increase, that s what we re talking about. When you take the state and local taxes and the property taxes and the mortgage deduction that is reduced to $500,000, it is a huge hit for every single California family.JOHN DICKERSON: All right, Congresswoman, thanks so much for being with us. And we ll back in one JACKIE SPEIER: Thank you, John.JOHN DICKERSON: minute with White House budget director Mick Mulvaney.",politics,"Nov 21, 2017",1

3 “MIDDLE EASTERN” Men Arrested For GANG RAPE Of Swedish Woman Broadcasted LIVE On Facebook,"Three men in Uppsala have been arrested on suspicion of rape after they raped a young woman and sent it live on Facebook, just as it was warned about would happen when Facebook introduced the feature.The arrest was made during a police action shortly after nine o clock in the morning.  They were arrested between nine and nine fifteen. The alert came in at 8:24, says Uppsala police officer, Ivan Aslund, to the Swedish news outlet Fria Tider.On Flashback, the men accused of the rape are identified as Middle Easterners. The rape was conducted at an address in Uppsala, and the men filmed themselves and sent the assault live via Facebook.According to a person who saw the live broadcast, the woman who was raped looked  quite intoxicated  and appeared  completely dead  while one of the men molested her. Several people alerted the police when they saw the film.The live broadcast on Facebook was not stopped until the police stormed into the room where the woman and the men were. The men will now be interrogated by the police.  Before prosecutors can make a decision, the policemen have to document everything, a complaint, write down observations and conduct interviews with those who have something to say. Once that is done, they will present it to the prosecutor, so it takes time, says Aslund.He is otherwise very secretive about the investigation and would not say anything about the rape that was sent live worldwide on Facebook from the new Sweden.The last transmission shows the police breaking into the apartment and arresting the rapists:",left-news,"Jan 23, 2017",1

"Hundreds of thousands march for unified Spain, poll shows depths of division","BARCELONA (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of supporters of a unified Spain filled Barcelona s streets on Sunday in one of the biggest shows of force yet by the so-called silent majority that has watched as regional political leaders push for Catalan independence. Political parties opposing a split by Catalonia from Spain had a small lead in an opinion poll published on Sunday, the first since Madrid called a regional election to try to resolve the country s worst political crisis in four decades. Polls and recent elections have shown that about half the electorate in the wealthy northeastern region, which is already autonomous, oppose secession from Spain, but a vocal independence movement has brought the current crisis to a head.  Spain s central government called an election for Dec. 21 on Friday after sacking Catalonia s president Carles Puigdemont, dissolving its parliament and dismissing its government. That followed the assembly s unilateral declaration of independence in a vote boycotted by three national parties. The regional government claimed it had a mandate to push ahead with independence following an unofficial referendum on Oct. 1 which was ruled illegal under Spanish law and mostly boycotted by unionists.  Waving thousands of Spanish flags and singing  Viva Espa a , protesters on Sunday turned out in the largest display of support for a united Spain since the beginning of the crisis   underlining the depth of division in Catalonia itself.  I m here to defend Spanish unity and the law,  said Alfonso Machado, 55, a salesman standing with a little girl with Spanish flags in her hair.   Knowing that in the end there won t be independence, I feel sorry for all the people tricked into thinking there could be and the divisions they ve driven through Catalan society.   The poll of 1,000 people by Sigma Dos for newspaper El Mundo showed unionist parties winning 43.4 percent support and pro-independence parties 42.5 percent.  The survey was taken from Monday to Thursday, just as the central government prepared to take control of Catalonia. Madrid said on Saturday that secessionist politicians, including Puigdemont, were free to take part in the election. The hardline CUP has been unclear if it would. The deposed Catalan government will soon have to make difficult decisions, Puigdemont s former deputy Oriol Junqueras said on Sunday in an editorial in online newspaper El Punt Avui. He stopped short of saying his ERC party would take part in the election.   We need a shared strategy ... it s important to weave solid alliances with those who are willing to build a state that serves its citizens,  he said, possibly alluding to a rumored alliance between the ERC and the Catalan arm of the anti-austerity Podemos party. Such an alliance could put the independence movement in difficult position as it would mean a main secession supporter joining forces with parties that reject Madrid s hard line but do not support separatism.         With weeks to go before the election, the poll showed the CUP, kingmaker for the pro-secessionists in the dismissed 135-seat parliament, would win seven seats, down from a current 10.  The pro-independence coalition Junts pel Si, which held 62 seats previously, was split into parties PDeCat and ERC for the poll as they are unlikely to run on a single platform. The two would win between 54 and 58 seats in total, the poll showed. At Sunday s rally, former European Parliament president Josep Borrell called for unionist voters to turn out in December to ensure independence supporters lose their stranglehold on the regional parliament.  Maybe we re here because many of us during elections didn t go and vote. Now we have a golden opportunity. This time, nobody should stay at home,  Borrell said to cheering crowds. Puigdemont called on Saturday for peaceful opposition to Madrid s takeover. But he was vague on precisely what steps the secessionists would take as Spanish authorities move into Barcelona to enforce control. European countries, the United States and Mexico have also rejected the Catalan declaration of independence and expressed support for Spain s unity. But emotions are running high and the next few days will be tricky for Madrid as it embarks on enforcing direct rule and putting officials in administrative roles. National police were accused of heavy-handedness during the Oct. 1 referendum.  Officers of the regional police force, called the Mossos d Esquadra in Catalan, were stationed in main public and government buildings on Sunday. But the force is believed to have divided loyalties. The central government has removed the Mossos  chief, Josep Lluis Trapero, and said units could be replaced if warranted. In an open letter on Sunday, Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido praised the Mossos for their work and urged them to accept temporary direction from Madrid.  The main secessionist group, the Catalan National Assembly, has urged civil servants not to follow orders from the central  government and to mount  peaceful resistance , while the pro-independence trade union CSC has called a strike. Puigdemont, Junqueras and their advisors left the Catalan government offices on Friday, newspaper La Vanguardia reported on Sunday, effectively handing the building over to Madrid and making a forced eviction on Monday less likely. Since the return of democracy in the late 1970s Spain has suffered several traumatic episodes, including an attempted military coup in 1981, a violent Basque separatist conflict, and more recently an economic crisis. The Catalan issue is however the biggest challenge to the territorial integrity of what is now a progressive European Union nation. The chaos has prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain s economy, the fourth-largest in the euro zone. Tourism to Barcelona has been hit and markets have darted up and down on the fast-moving developments. European leaders have also denounced the push, fearing it could fan separatist sentiment around the continent. ",worldnews,"October 29, 2017 ",0
Greek pensioners protest against government that 'took everything',"ATHENS (Reuters) - Several hundred elderly Greeks marched through Athens on Thursday, protesting against a government they say  took everything  with a new round of cuts to pensions and crumbling health care benefits.  Greece s three bailouts since 2010 have repeatedly taken aim at the pension system. Cuts have pushed nearly half its elderly below the poverty line with incomes of less 600 euros ($710.70) a month. With nearly a quarter of the workforce unemployed, a quarter of children living in poverty and benefits slashed, parents have grown dependent on grandparents for handouts. But after the cuts to pensions, some Greeks have seen their monthly cheque fall between 40 and 50 percent in seven years. After rent, utility bills and health care, they barely make ends meet.  I have never seen the country in this state, not even during war,  said 80-year-old Nikos Georgiadis, a former hotel employee whose pension has been reduced by 40 percent.   Pensioners are impoverished, and not only can they not afford to buy medicines, some are looking for food in the trash,  he said, leaning on a tree to catch his breath.  New changes to pension regulations mean more cuts are expected in 2019. Pensioners also have to pay more out of pocket for health care. Fotini Karavidou, a 75-year-old retired accountant who joined the march in a wheelchair, said she had to  cut back on everything  to afford medicine.   It s simple - many pensioners cannot afford to eat and to buy medicine,  said Yiannis Karadimas, 67, who heads a local pensioners association. Karadimas said it was  a joke  that the government had legalised marijuana for medical purposes while cutting back on health care spending.   They re killing us and they re mocking us at the same time,  he said.  The popularity of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has waned since he first won elections in 2015. In an effort to rebuild public support, the government gave Greece s 1.3 million pensioners a one-off Christmas bonus last year, worth 300 to 500 euros each. But the handouts have failed to whip up any obvious increase in support. Pensioners have taken to the streets time and again in recent months. About 2,000 people joined Thursday s march.   Unfortunately, I voted for them, and they turned out to be the biggest liars of all,  Georgiadis, the pensioner, said.  It (the government) promised us everything, and it took everything.

MO DEMOCRAT LAWMAKER Under Investigation By Secret Service For Saying: “I Hope Trump Is Assassinated” On Facebook…But Response By Man Who Claims Cousin Is On Trump’s Secret Service Detail Could Be More Serious Threat,"The U.S. Secret Service is investigating a Facebook post from Missouri state Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, D-University City, in which she stated:  I hope Trump is assassinated! A conversation between MO state Senator Maria Chappelle-Nadal and Christopher Gagn  of Ferguson, MO, (In his Facebook profile he claims he s an  Investigative Journalist focused on Social Justice, Police Misconduct and Prison Reform ) was screen shot and saved before either party had a chance to delete it. The conversation included the senator openly hoping that President Trump would be assassinated and Facebook user Christophe Gagne, who told her that his cousin is on President Trump s  Secret Service Detail . Gagn s comments seem to infer that his cousin is being forced to protect President Trump because he had to sign up for 6 years of service and has already served 4 years of his contract protecting Barack Obama. Gagn  went on to say,   I truly believe [it] will happen sooner not later.  while referring to the assassination of our president.For obvious reasons, everyone seems to be focused on what the MO state Senator said when she openly hoped for Trump s assassination, but shouldn t the Secret Service be making a call to Christopher Gagn  who claims to have a cousin assigned to protecting the life of our president and claiming that he will be assassinated sooner than later? Does Gagn have some sort of an inside scoop? For all we know, Gagn  may not even be telling the truth about having a cousin on President Trump s Secret Service detail, but sure seems it would certainly be worth the time it would take for the Secret Service to look into it.  St. Louis Post-Dispatch: Chappelle-Nadal s comment, referring to President Donald Trump, has since been removed. But Chappelle-Nadal confirmed to the Post-Dispatch that she had written it in response to another commenter before deleting it. I didn t mean what I put up. Absolutely not. I was very frustrated,  Chappelle-Nadal told the newspaper.  Things have got to change. The U.S. Secret Service s St. Louis field office  is looking into this,  the office confirmed.Kristina Schmidt, special agent in charge, told the Post-Dispatch that  hypothetically  in such investigations, agents try to  determine intent, to determine if there was a violation of federal law. If there is, then we refer it to the U.S. Attorney. Our primary goal is to determine if there is intent and meaning behind it,  Schmidt said.According to a screenshot of the now-deleted conversation obtained by the Post-Dispatch, another commenter named Christopher Gagn  was writing about a cousin of his who he said was on Trump s Secret Service detail. But, what I posted earlier, I truly believe will happen, sooner   not later,  he wrote. ",left-news,"Aug 17, 2017",1
HUMILIATING: Democrats Use RUSSIAN WARSHIPS As Backdrop For Tribute To U.S. VETERANS At DNC,"Maybe Hillary s Russian uranium deal included a cameo of Russian warships on the DNC stage? It certainly wouldn t surprise anyone . On the last night of the Democratic National Convention, a retired Navy four-star took the stage to pay tribute to veterans. Behind him, on a giant screen, the image of four hulking warships reinforced his patriotic message.But there was a big mistake in the stirring backdrop: those are Russian warships.While retired Adm. John Nathman, a former commander of Fleet Forces Command, honored vets as America s best, the ships from the Russian Federation Navy were arrayed like sentinels on the big screen above.These were the very Soviet-era combatants that Nathman and Cold Warriors like him had once squared off against. The ships are definitely Russian,  said noted naval author Norman Polmar after reviewing hi-resolution photos from the event.  There s no question of that in my mind. Naval experts concluded the background was a photo composite of Russian ships that were overflown by what appear to be U.S. trainer jets. It remains unclear how or why the Democratic Party used what s believed to be images of the Russian Black Sea Fleet at their convention.In a new survey of American military personnel, Donald Trump emerged as active-duty service members  preference to become the next U.S. president, topping Hillary Clinton by more than a 2-to-1 margin.

Turkey's Justice Ministry says it canceled delegation visit,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey s Justice Ministry said on Tuesday said it had canceled a planned delegation visit to the United States due to the on-going visa crisis, denying local media reports that Washington had rejected to grant the delegation travel visas. CNN Turk and other local media earlier reported that U.S. authorities had declined to grant visas to members of the delegation.   Due to the recent visa crisis between the two countries, the visit was canceled by our Ministry,  the Justice Ministry said in a statement, adding that there were no visa applications to be rejected.

North Korea says Peru throwing 'gas on the fire' of nuclear spat,"LIMA (Reuters) - North Korea s ambassador to Peru said Tuesday that Lima s decision to expel him was akin to  throwing gasoline on the fire  on the dispute over Pyongyang s nuclear tests that it would continue to pursue  without wavering.  Peru declared the ambassador, Kim Hak-Chol, a persona non grata on Monday to protest North Korea s refusal to heed the world s  constant calls  to end its nuclear program - giving him five days to leave the Andean country.  The bilateral and diplomatic measure taken yesterday by the Peruvian government lacks judicial and moral reasoning and doesn t further world peace and security at all,  Kim said, reading from a statement at a news conference in Lima.  To the contrary, it throws gasoline on the fire for which we express protest and regret,  Kim added before declining to take questions from reporters. Peru s decision to expel Kim followed a similar move by Mexico last week and a public call from the United States last month for Latin American countries to sever ties with North Korea. Peruvian Foreign Minister Ricardo Luna said the move was strongly rooted in international law as reflected by new U.N. sanctions against North Korea passed on Monday.  It s inappropriate to maintain relations with that country,  Luna said in broadcast comments to journalists.  Though we haven t broken off ties, by expelling him the level of diplomats in charge of relations is lowered.  North Korea has faced growing condemnation from around the world following its sixth and largest nuclear test this month which fueled fears it could spark war. U.S. President Donald Trump has described the boosted sanctions passed by the U.N. Security Council on Monday as  nothing compared to what ultimately will have to happen.  Kim condemned the sanctions as part of the hostility from the United States regarding North Korea that he said has forced Pyongyang to pursue nuclear tests as a dissuasive measure.  That s a problem between us and the United States,  Kim said.  We ll continue without wavering on the path of justice that we ve chosen despite the slander and defamation from the United States because we re certain our cause is just and will triumph.  Kim will leave Peru as requested and two diplomats will remain in charge of the embassy, an embassy representative said. Peru does not have any diplomats in North Korea. Pyongyang opened its embassy in Peru in the 1980s during the first government of former President Alan Garcia, which bought weapons from North Korea at a discount for police. Trade between the two countries is minimal. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",0
Hillary Clinton says her family's foundation is looking for partners,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said on Friday the Clinton Foundation was seeking other organizations to  partner with as it looks to wind down some of its charitable work, but defended her work as secretary of state as independent from her family’s foundation. Clinton has come under fire in recent days amid questions over the charity and its donors given her role heading the State Department from 2009 to early 2013. Critics have accused her of running a “pay-for-play” operation, a charge she and the foundation have denied. Even some supporters have said Clinton faces a perception problem over the issue.  “I know the foundation is looking for partners, but that’s going to take some time to carry out,” Clinton said in an interview on MSNBC. “Winding down some of these programs takes time. You don’t just turn on and off ... a switch. Even trying to negotiate with partner groups takes a lot of serious effort.”  “My work as secretary of state was not influenced by any outside forces. I made policy decisions based on what I thought was right to keep Americans safe and to protect our interests abroad. I believe my aides also acted appropriately,” she said.  Several media editorial boards this week noted the foundation’s philanthropic efforts in areas such as global health and HIV/AIDS, but urged the foundation - formally called the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation - to transfer the work to other large U.S. charities. Former President Bill Clinton, who helped establish the global charity after serving two terms in the White House, would resign from the board if his wife wins the Nov. 8  election, the foundation announced last week. It also said it would stop accepting some foreign and corporate donations. Hillary Clinton’s Republican rival for the White House, Donald Trump, and other Republicans have called for a special prosecutor to probe the charity for possible corruption, an accusation her campaign has called a groundless political smear.

LOL! DEMOCRATS’ “Poster Child For Stupidity” Can’t Tell MSNBC Host What Her Party Stands For Besides Hating Trump [VIDEO],"Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.) struggled Friday on MSNBC to explain what the Democratic Party stands for besides opposing President Trump.Waters has been one of the most outspoken critics of Trump in Congress, repeatedly calling for his impeachment and insisting that if investigators  connect the dots,  then his campaign s alleged collusion with Russia will become apparent.Given Waters  public profile as a staunch Trump opponent, MSNBC host Katy Tur asked the lawmaker what Democrats actually stand for beyond opposing Trump s agenda. Congresswoman, what do the Democrats stand for other than being against Donald Trump?  Tur asked.  What do you stand for other than trying to get Donald Trump impeached? Everyone knows that I am the ranking member of the Financial Services Committee and that I have spent many, many hours and days implementing the Dodd-Frank reforms,  Waters responded.The California Democrat proceeded to frame her work on Dodd-Frank in the context of opposing Republicans, which Tur noted. We pushed back on the Republicans, we fight against them,  Waters said.  [They] attempt[ed] to go get rid of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau before we came up with the reforms under Dodd-Frank. Tur pushed back. Are Democrats focusing enough on their ideas?  she asked.Waters then went on to explain how effective the Democrat Party has been in their organizing efforts to disrupt town halls where Republican political leaders are speaking to their constituents. Listen, if you have not been keeping up with the town halls that have been going on,  Waters said, referring to the protesters at many Republican town halls, where we have basically organized America around the [Affordable Care Act] and protected Obamacare and the thousands of people who have come out who now are very much informed about the difference between Obamacare and Trumpcare.   WFBWhat Maxine doesn t understand is that when Tea Party members attended town hall meetings across American and challenged their elected leaders on reckless tax legislation they didn t need to be organized by the Republican Party. Tea Party members weren t just targeting Democrat politicians, they were targeting anyone who they felt wasn t representing the people who elected them into office. ",left-news,"May 20, 2017",1
OBAMA WARNS: Crackdown On Terrorism In U.S. Would Violate Iran Deal,"Never mind that Iran continues to violate Obama s lopsided deal Senior Obama administration officials are expressing concern that congressional attempts to tighten laws preventing terrorists from entering the United States could violate the Iran nuclear agreement and prompt Tehran to walk away from the agreement.Congress is considering measures that would tighten the Visa Waiver Program to make it harder for potential terrorists to legally enter the United States by increasing restrictions on individuals who have travelled to countries with prominent terrorist organizations from bypassing security checks upon entering the United States.Iranian officials have in recent days repeatedly issued threatening statements to the Obama administration, saying that such moves would violate the nuclear agreement, and the Obama administration last week conveyed the Iranian anger to American lawmakers.Stephen Mull, the State Department official in charge of implementing the Iran deal, warned the Senate Foreign Relations Committee late last week that these congressional efforts  could have a very negative impact on the deal. Under the revised law, which came in the week of a deadly terrorist attack in California, individuals who have travelled to Iran a lead sponsor of global terrorism would no longer be eligible to participate in the Visa Waiver Program, which permits individuals from 38 partner nations to more easily enter the United States.Congress remains concerned that gaps in the program could prevent federal law enforcement officials from detecting terror-tied individuals before they are granted entrance to U.S. soil.However, a portion of the Iran nuclear deal mandates that the United States not take any action that could harm Iran s economic relationships with other countries. Iranian officials maintain that the new restrictions violate this passage of the deal.Ali Larijani, the speaker of Iran s parliament, said last week that these tightened measures  are aimed at harassment  and that they  blatantly violate the nuclear agreement,  according to comments carried by the Iranian state-controlled press.Larijani warned that this action will detonate the deal before it has even been implemented. If the Americans pursue the plan, they will destroy an achievement with their own hands since it is against the [nuclear deal] and it will trouble them,  he warned.Rep. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) echoed these concerns last week when he questioned Mull during a Senate hearing.Visa waiver reform efforts include  a naming of Iran such that individuals who have travelled to Iran will no loner be eligible for the visa waiver program,  Murphy said.  There has been a suggestion because there is an element of the agreement that obligates us to not to take steps that would stop economic relations between other nations and Iran that we could perhaps be in jeopardy of breaching the agreement. Mull agreed with this assessment. I have heard from very senior, and Secretary [of State John] Kerry has as well, from very senior officials of differing European allies of ours that it could have a very negative impact on the deal,  he said.Sources working with Congress on the Iran deal criticized the Obama administration for attempting to stymie increased action on terrorism due to its desire to preserve the nuclear deal. According to the Obama administration s latest interpretation, the nuclear deal allows Iran to test ballistic missiles in violation of international law, but does not allow Congress to prevent terrorists from coming into the United States,  Omri Ceren, the managing director of press and strategy at The Israel Project, a D.C.-based organization that works with journalists on Middle East issues, told the Washington Free Beacon.Seyed Araqchi, Iran s deputy foreign minister, also warned that Iran is prepared to  take action  against the United States for implementing visa restrictions.Iran s latest threat to break the deal comes amid numerous Iranian provocations, including multiple tests of advanced ballistic missiles, acts prohibited under United Nations Security Council resolutions.The Obama administration repeatedly said that, while it does not agree with those launches, they do not violate the nuclear deal.Via: WFB",Government News,"Dec 21, 2015",1

CONGRESS JUST DEALT A BIG BLOW To Obama And His Favorite Terror Group [VIDEO],"Obama has shown favoritism towards the Muslim Brotherhood terror group almost since the first day of his presidency. Many are convinced Obama is tied to the terror group through his brother, and his desire to prevent Americans from referring to this group as a  terror group  doesn t do much to convince us he doesn t have some sort of ties to them. Obama quietly offered his support when the riots Arab Spring uprisings took place in Egypt, paving the way for the Muslim Brotherhood Islamist, Mohamed Morsy to take over as President of Egypt through  fair  elections The House Judiciary Committee passed a bill on Wednesday calling on the State Department to classify the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist group, by a 17-10 party-line vote.The GOP leadership under Speaker Paul Ryan supports the legislation, a high-ranking Republican source told the Investigative Project on Terrorism (IPT) on background. This makes floor passage more likely.The bill states that it is the  sense of Congress that the Muslim Brotherhood meets the criteria for classification as a foreign terrorist organization. Under the bill as amended by committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), Secretary of State John Kerry would have 60 days to issue a detailed report to Congress indicating whether the Brotherhood meets the criteria qualifying it as a terrorist group. The Brotherhood s strategic goal in America is a kind of grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and  sabotaging  its miserable house from within so that it is eliminated and God s religion is made victorious over all other religions,  Goodlatte said, quoting the Brotherhood s 1991 Explanatory Memorandum, in a statement given before the vote.Here is Muslim terror expert, Brigitte Gabriel explaining the plan by the Muslim Brotherhood to jihad in North America. After watching this, you may ask yourself what has taken Congress so long to act? The Brotherhood and its leaders and affiliates, such as Hamas, have supported Islamist terrorism   directly, through fundraising, and through exhortation. Each of these activities constitutes an act of terrorism under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Under the bill, the Obama Administration would be forced to deny admittance to any foreign national tied to the Muslim Brotherhood.Since Obama became President, people connected to the Muslim Brotherhood have received entry visas despite their open support for terrorist groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah.There are many who believe the Muslim Brotherhood has been given special treatment by our very own  President,  and that he is somehow tied to the group:HERE, Rep Louie Gohmert (R-TX) is asking why the Obama regime gave $1.5 BILLION to the Muslim Brotherhood:Previously banned individuals such as Sheikh Rached Ghannouchi, head of Tunisia s branch of the Brotherhood, and Tariq Ramadan, grandson of Brotherhood founder Hasan al-Banna, have been welcomed to the US by the Obama Administration despite their vocal support for Hamas. Ramadan fought his ban on entering the US in court, and won an appeal.Other foreign Brotherhood speakers such as Ragheb Elsergany exploit the platform given to them by the Obama Administration to advocate for Muslims to support Palestinian  mujahideen  fighting against Israel.If the Brotherhood were designated as a terrorist group, it would be a crime for people in the United Sates to provide material support to it, and the Treasury Department could force banks to block financial transactions related to the Brotherhood. The bill lists US groups, including the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), and the North American Islamic Trust (NAIT), as groups under the control of the international Muslim Brotherhood. The Muslim Brotherhood continues to pose a global threat. The jihadist movement actively supports and finances terrorist networks around the world, including al-Qaida and Hamas. The United States must recognize and sanction the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization as part of our national security strategy,  co-sponsor Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, (R-Fla.), said in a statement. Via: The Alemeiner ",left-news,"Feb 26, 2016",1

OBAMA UNLEASHES HUNDREDS Of Intelligence Agents To “Protect Elections” From Outside Forces…Hacker known as “Guccifer 2.0” Warns Of Threat “From INSIDE The System”,"We all know by now that the biggest threat to the integrity of our vote is our very own President, the Democrat Party and their operatives. LOL! Russians are the least of our concerns The U.S. government is gearing up for an unprecedented effort to protect Tuesday s presidential election from cyber attack, U.S. officials told NBC News. There are a lot of eyes on this presidential election   more than there normally would be,  a senior Obama administration official said.Cyber centers at the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department and the FBI   as well as the Pentagon, the CIA and other intelligence agencies   will be on alert, with extra staff hunting for any possible threat, officials say.The concern is so high, intelligence officials told NBC, that for the first time, hundreds of military and intelligence cyber experts who work out of top secret facilities, including underground bunkers, will be monitoring intelligence about a U.S. presidential election. They will react to any threat to the federal government s communication and command systems.

There is maybe a one in three chance of this happening but it s not insignificant,  said Stavridis.On Friday the hacker known as  Guccifer 2.0    which U.S. officials say is a front for Russian intelligence   tweeted a threat to monitor the U.S. elections  from inside the system.

That s quite a distinction, considering the sheer number of idiots hoping to win the GOP nomination this year.Rubio became a household name in 2013, after delivering the GOP s annual response to the President s state of the Union address.While no-one remembers a word then-Senator Rubio said during the speech, the image of him guzzling water from a plastic bottle will never fade from our collective memory.Since then Rubio has won the hearts of republican voters, who appear to love him not just because he is rabidly anti-gay, but also because he repeatedly brags that he is  not a Scientist.

 Donald Trump Thanks The ‘Poorly Educated’ For Handing Him Victory In Nevada (VIDEO),"Donald Trump moved ever closer to securing the Republican nomination for President of the United States this week with victory in the Nevada caucus.There s no way around it   Trump thrashed his opponents in Nevada. He won a massive 45.9% of the vote, knocking Marco Rubio into 2nd place with just 23.9%, and Cruz in 3rd on 21.4%. It appears that the Trump campaign is unassailable at this point, although a week is a long time in U.S. politics.Graphic via GuardianPerhaps the darkest moment of the night was when Trump actually said these words in his victory speech: We won with poorly educated! I love the poorly educated! There were whopping cheers and applause for this comment. Which seemingly bore zero irony. He continued: We re the smartest people. We re the most loyal people. First things first: Donald Trump is not poorly educated. He attended the Kew Forest School until 8th grade before spending the rest of his schooling in the New York Military Academy. He later won a bachelors degree in Economic from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. So, another total lie from this candidate.One reason  poorly educated  might appeal to Trump though, is that part of the education process is to give a person the tools to think critically about an issue, and to fact-check arguments. It is not to say you cannot have these skills without a decent high school education, but it s an uphill struggle. It s not impossible to save a person having a heart attack without having had medical training, but you d put your money on the doctor every time.So, now wonder Trump would like to keep America under-educated.According to leading fact-checking site Politifact, just 1% of claims made by Donald Trump are true. One percent! Meanwhile, 3 out of every 5 statements he makes are absolute lies. Let s take a look back at some of those lies:They just keep on coming.And on the matter of faith, Donald Trump is now claiming to be some sort of born again evangelical. Yet, Trump has been married three times, pokes fun of Holy Communion as eating  the little cracker , claims he has never asked God to forgive his sins in his life, and could not name a single passage of the Bible when pressed for his favorite piece of scripture.Trump is about as devout a Christian as Bill Nye.And yet, he is winning evangelical support in droves. Why? Because the evangelical, Christian Conservative movement has zero to do with faith in God, and everything to do with a fanatical conviction in right-wing principles of crony capitalism, white supremacy, homophobia and sexism.If this was not the case, Trump would be the LAST candidate that appealed to Evangelicals. To any right-thinking Christian, he is the 21st century incarnation of the Whore of Babylon.But Trump gets a pass for all of this, because under-educated people are having their ignorance exploited, and bigoted people are having their bellies tickled. This resurgent right is euphoric that it s candidate can say things on national television that have been outlawed in workplaces and public spaces for decades. They are thrilled that hate has been made mainstream by their candidate, and they are going to come out in their droves to support him.This means that voting in this year s election will be the most important ballots cast on American soil in a very long time. The reproductive rights of women, the rights of LGBT Americans, the rights of non-Christians, the rights of victims of rape and sexual assault, the rights of victims of gun crime, the rights of non-white Americans   they are all on the chopping block in this election.  Every American with a conscience and a sense of decency has the absolute duty to make a stand against this sh*tstorm of stupidity, bigotry and ignorance.

Apple refused China request for source code in last two years: lawyer,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has been asked by Chinese authorities within the last two years to hand over its source code but refused, the company’s top lawyer told lawmakers on Tuesday in response to U.S. law enforcement criticism of its stance on technology security. The congressional testimony highlighted an issue at the heart of a heated disagreement between Apple and the FBI over unlocking encrypted data from an iPhone linked to last December’s San Bernardino, California shootings - how much private technology companies should cooperate with governments. Law enforcement officials have attempted to portray Apple as possibly complicit in handing over information to China’s government for business reasons while refusing to cooperate with U.S. requests for access to private data in criminal cases. “I want to be very clear on this,” Apple general counsel Bruce Sewell told Tuesday’s hearing under oath. “We have not provided source code to the Chinese government.” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, asked about the comments, said she did “not understand” details of the situation. She did not elaborate. China’s Public Security Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Apple has previously denied the accusation as a “smear” originating from the U.S. Department of Justice’s effort to force Apple to help unlock the iPhone 5c used by one of the two  San Bernardino killers, who were inspired by Islamist militants. The claim resurfaced in the hearing called by a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee to examine potential common ground between law enforcement and the technology sector in the  encryption debate, though more than three hours of testimony yielded little clear agreement. Captain Charles Cohen, commander in the Indiana State Police, repeated the suggestion that Apple has quietly cooperated with Beijing, which strictly regulates technology in exchange for access to its market.  But when pressed by Representative Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat, for the source of that claim, Cohen only cited news reports. “That takes my breath away,” a visibly frustrated Eshoo said. “That is a huge allegation.” The Justice Department had argued in the San Bernardino case that it would be willing to demand Apple turn over source code that underlies its products, though at the time it only sought the company’s cooperation in writing new software that would disable the passcode protections on the phone. Technology and security experts have said that if the U.S. government was able to obtain Apple’s source code with a conventional court order, other governments would demand equal rights to do the same thing. After winning a court order in February, the Federal Bureau of Investigation dropped its case against Apple last month when it said it had found a third party entity to help investigators hack into the iPhone used by gunman Rizwan Farook. On Tuesday, Apple and the FBI were making a second appearance in Congress since March to testify over law enforcement access to encrypted devices, a decades-old dispute between Silicon Valley and Washington that gained renewed life from the San Bernardino case. While that standoff underscored national security concerns posed by advances in technology security, the growing use of strong default encryption on mobile devices and communications by criminal suspects is handicapping investigators’ ability to pursue routine cases, law enforcement officials told the hearing. Apple and other companies defend the technology as integral to protecting consumers. The FBI relies heavily on the “services and specialized skills that we can only get through the private industry, and that partnership is critical to our success,” testified FBI technology official Amy Hess. Separately, the tech advocacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation sued the Justice Department in San Francisco federal court on Tuesday, seeking to force the disclosure of any secret orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that may have forced companies such as Apple or Google to decrypt communications.   Thomas Galati, chief of intelligence at the New York Police Department, said his investigators had been unable to open 67  Apple devices from October 2015 to March 2016. Those phones were implicated in 44 violent crimes 23 felonies, including 10 homicides, two rapes, and the shooting of an officer, Galati said. The government has redoubled its efforts to use the courts to force Apple’s cooperation in cracking encrypted iPhones by announcing plans to continue with an appeal in a New York drug case. The secrecy surrounding the method used on the San Bernardino phone has prompted criticism from security researchers who said Apple and others should be made aware of the flaw, in accordance with a White House vulnerabilities review process that favors disclosure. But Obama administration sources have told Reuters the group that helped unlock the device has sole ownership of the method, making it highly unlikely the technique would be disclosed by the government to Apple or anyone else. “I don’t think relying on a third party is a good model,”  Representative Diana DeGette of Colorado, the committee’s top Democrat, said at the hearing.

"Lower taxes, big gains: The stocks poised to win from tax cuts","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A proposal driven by President Donald Trump to overhaul the country’s tax system is moving through U.S. Congress, lifting the overall stock market and raising hopes that corporate earnings will get a boost. The S&P 500 .SPX rallied this week as the drive to push sweeping tax legislation through the U.S. Senate gained momentum, although gains were tempered by a report that former national security adviser Michael Flynn was prepared to testify that before taking office Trump had directed him to make contact with Russians. Senate Republicans said on Friday they had gathered the votes needed to pass a sweeping tax overhaul. While negotiations are ongoing, the legislation could cut the corporate tax rate to as low as 20 percent from 35 percent. UBS strategists project that overall S&P 500 earnings would rise by 6.5 percent should the corporate tax rate fall to 25 percent and increase by 9.5 percent should the rate go to 20 percent.  But certain stocks could benefit more than others from the Republican-led plans. “It will be favorable to companies with primarily domestic business that are paying close to the full tax rate,” said John Carey, portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. Investors appear to have already rotated into some of these tax-sensitive areas. Some market watchers caution about generalizing winners, noting big differences in effective rates between companies in the same sectors.  But strategists point to industries with a concentration of companies poised to benefit, particularly from a lower corporate tax rate. (For a graphic on industries that stand to win from corporate tax cuts, click reut.rs/2zVJls9) (For a graphic on sector benefits from a corporate tax cut, click reut.rs/2AMn9AU) (High tax stocks underperform in 2017: reut.rs/2AMdrP5) Of the major S&P sectors, financials pay the highest effective tax rate at 27.5 percent, according to a Wells Fargo analysis of historical tax rates. Brian Klock, managing director in equity research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods who covers large regional banks, expects tax cuts to add 16 percent to median bank earnings in 2018 and 18 percent in 2019. “We’re assuming whatever the benefit is will drop right to the bottom line,” Klock said. “They won’t give up on loan pricing or put any big investments in. With the increased capital they’ll return it to shareholders.” Among large regional banks, Zions Bancorp (ZION.O), M&T Bank Corp (MTB.N) and Comerica Inc (CMA.N) stand to benefit the most, Klock said. Transportation ranks among the top industries expected to receive a big earnings boost from a lower corporate tax rate, according to UBS. U.S. railroads such as Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N) and CSX Corp (CSX.O) are almost entirely exposed to the U.S. statutory rates, said Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker. Railroads would benefit from provisions allowing them to expense their capital expenditures in one year as opposed to over time, lowering their taxable income, Schoonmaker said. “We’ll see what comes out as far as the ability to depreciate immediately, but that certainly would be beneficial because they are all big capital spenders,” Schoonmaker said, noting that railroads spend 18 percent to 20 percent of revenue on capital expenditures. Airlines stand to gain from lower tax rates, analysts said, with UBS pointing to Alaska Air Group Inc (ALK.N) and Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) as possible winners. Domestically geared healthcare companies that focus on services would likely benefit more from tax rate reductions than pharmaceutical and medical device companies that sell their products overseas. “Healthcare services is one of the most taxed industries and would be a big beneficiary of reductions in corporate tax rates,” Lance Wilkes, an analyst at Bernstein, said in a recent note. The S&P 500 healthcare providers and services index .SPLRCHCPS, which includes health insurers such as Anthem Inc (ANTM.N), drug wholesalers like AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC.N), and hospital operators such as HCA Healthcare inc (HCA.N), has gained 5.4 percent this week. According to Leerink analyst Ana Gupte, a corporate tax rate cut to 20 percent could boost health insurer earnings by about 20 percent to 40 percent, but some of those gains would be expected to be passed through to employer and individual customers. Other potential big winners include home health services company Almost Family Inc (AFAM.O), lab-testing company Quest Diagnostics Inc (DGX.N) and pharmacy benefit manger Express Scripts Holding (ESRX.O), according to Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut. Department stores head the list of retailers that will benefit because they have among the heaviest U.S. exposure, said Bridget Weishaar, senior equity analyst at Morningstar.  Weishaar points to Macy’s Inc (M.N), Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) and Kohls Corp (KSS.N) as potential winners among department stores, as well as  Victoria’s Secret owner L Brands (LB.N) and apparel retailer Ross Stores (ROST.O). “Retail companies will benefit from paying a lower tax rate,” Weishaar said. “Consumers hopefully will have additional cash, which will help consumer discretionary spending.” Telecom companies, including AT&T Inc (T.N) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), also stand to gain. “They’re domestically focused companies with a very high percentage of their employee base in the U.S. and significant amounts of investments in U.S. infrastructure,” said Amir Rozwadowski, telecom equity analyst at Barclays. “Therefore they’re predisposed to benefit from tax reform.” AT&T has climbed 4.9 percent this week, while Verizon has surged 9 percent.

Trump ends nine-day overseas trip with a flourish as trouble looms at home,"SIGONELLA, Italy (Reuters) - With trouble facing him back home, U.S. President Donald Trump ended his nine-day overseas journey in dramatic fashion on Saturday, addressing U.S. troops at a campaign-style rally. Trump flipped traditional U.S. foreign policy upside down on his tour through the Middle East and Europe, coddling Middle Eastern leaders with questionable human rights records while demanding traditional European allies pay more for their defense. At a Group of Seven summit in the resort town of Taormina on the island of Sicily, Trump refused to entreaties from the other six allies to maintain U.S. support for the Paris climate agreement, insisting he needed more time to make up his mind. In a hangar at Naval Air Station Sigonella, which is also on Sicily, Trump was introduced by his wife Melania, who has raised eyebrows during the trip by twice flicking away her husband’s hand when he tried to hold hers. “My husband worked very hard on this trip and I am very proud of him,” she said. Trump, whose Marine One helicopter landed from Taormina to the soaring soundtrack of the “Air Force One” movie, emerged from two days of closed door summitry to declare his trip a success. Trump said he had helped forge more international cooperation in the fight against Islamist militants, a threat he said was underscored by a suicide bomber in Manchester, England, and the killing of Coptic Christians in Egypt. “It was a tremendously productive meeting where I strengthen American bonds,” said Trump. “We have great bonds with other countries and, with some of our closest allies, we concluded a truly historic week.” Trump skipped the traditional end-of-trip news conference to avoid facing questions about a host of problems he faces upon his return to Washington later on Saturday. His May 9 firing of former FBI Director James Comey has raised concerns about whether he was trying to squelch a federal probe into his campaign’s ties with Russia last year. The questions have been intensified in the wake of disclosures on Friday that a senior adviser, Jared Kushner, the husband of Trump’s daughter Ivanka, had contacts with the Russians in December about opening a secret back channel of communications with Moscow. Trump used his trip to promote “America First” policies,  promoting $110 billion worth of arms sales to Saudi Arabia and telling G-7 allies that the United States needs a more level playing field on trade. His body language on the trip demonstrated his typically brash behavior, dramatized by his demands that NATO allies pay more for their defense and his refusal to explicitly declare that the United States backs Article 5 of the alliance’s charter, which requires each member to come to the defense of each other. His pushing aside of the prime minister of Montenegro to get in place for a family photo generated headlines across Europe. At Sigonella, Trump said his appeals to NATO allies to pay more was working. “Money is starting to flow in,” he said. “It’s only fair to the United States. We’re behind NATO all the way. But we want to be treated fairly.” ",politicsNews,"May 27, 2017 ",0

Trump on rival Bush's exit: Don't look at me,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has for months rained withering ridicule on onetime party favorite Jeb Bush, on Sunday refused to take responsibility for the former Florida governor’s exit from the 2016 White House race. “I just don’t know what did him in,” Trump, who won South Carolina’s Republican primary election handily on Saturday, said in an interview on CNN. Trump had repeatedly made Bush the target of pointed attacks throughout his campaign for the Republican nomination to run in the Nov. 8 general election, labeling him “weak,” “low-energy” and “an embarrassment” to the Bush political dynasty. On Sunday, Trump denied any role he may have played in taking down Bush, who ended his campaign on Saturday night after a fourth-place finish in South Carolina. “Jeb fought very hard,” the billionaire businessman said. “It wasn’t his time. That’s all.” Bush, the brother of one president and the son of another, had prided himself as the only candidate to attack Trump head-on throughout the campaign and frequently accused him of lacking ideas. He appeared to take one last jab at Trump in his concession speech on Saturday, saying: “Despite what you may have heard, ideas matter. Policy matters.” Sounding less like his normally combative self, Trump on Sunday credited Bush in a pair of interviews with having fought hard in the campaign and called him “very capable.” “Those last couple of weeks he was on television so much, I was looking,  I’d say, ‘Man, I’ve never seen anything like this,’” Trump said on CNN. He did, however, chide Bush for having run “brutal” negative ads against him, saying he was “a little bit offended.” “So, you know, this is a tough business, I will tell you,” the billionaire real-estate mogul said of presidential politics. “I think real estate in Manhattan is a lot easier.”  (Reporting by Megan Cassella; Editing by Jonathan Oatis) This article was funded in part by SAP.

"U.S. farm groups discuss policy with Clinton staff, pursue Trump","CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. agriculture groups are pushing for continuing talks with the presumptive Democratic and Republican presidential nominees in an effort to influence their farm policy positions as a slump in crop prices squeezes the sector’s profits. Representatives of about a dozen trade associations, including the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Farmers Union, met with staffers for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton on Friday at her New York campaign headquarters. It was the farm coalition’s first meeting with Clinton’s staff and included discussions of issues ranging from agricultural trade and labor to mandatory labels for foods containing genetically modified ingredients, attendees said on Wednesday. The meeting was the start of a push by the sector for more details from Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump about their stances on issues affecting farmers and agribusiness. The groups are seeking a meeting with Trump’s campaign. “All of us agreed, on both sides of the table, that it is a successful meeting only if it’s the first of a number of exchanges,” said Jay Vroom, the chief executive of pesticide association CropLife America, who attended the session. The candidates’ agriculture policies are crucial, the groups say, because net U.S. farm income is forecast to drop to its lowest since 2002, largely due to a decline in grain prices. If that happens, incomes will be down 56 percent from a recent high of $123.3 billion in 2013. “With that kind of climate, we’re definitely concerned about what farm policy will look like building to the next (congressional) farm bill,” said Tom Bryant, the National Farmers Union’s membership director.     If elected, Clinton will increase agricultural production and profitability for family farms, spokesman Tyrone Gayle said. A Trump spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Matt Paul, a former U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesman working with Clinton’s campaign, participated in the meeting. The gathering came a day after Britain’s surprise vote to exit the European Union, which drew support from some regions with low population densities. Chandler Goule, incoming CEO of the National Association of Wheat Growers, said farm groups drew parallels to Britain’s referendum because “it’s going to be rural America that’s going to turn out for this election, that’s actually going to determine the outcome of this (presidential) election.” Now that Clinton and Trump are the presumed nominees, “it’s time to start making more detailed and more in-the-weeds-type commitments,” he said.

Kuwait orders North Korea's ambassador to leave within a month,"KUWAIT (Reuters) - Kuwait has ordered North Korea s ambassador to leave within a month as the Gulf country downgraded diplomatic relations with Pyongyang, a North Korean diplomat in the Gulf region said on Sunday. The United Nations Security Council imposed new sanctions after North Korea s sixth and largest nuclear test this month, and the United States called on countries to sever diplomatic and financial ties with it.  The diplomat, who asked not to be named, told Reuters the ambassador, So Chang Sik, will leave following Kuwait s decision to downgrade the North Korean diplomatic representation to charge d affaires level. However, Chang Sik was planning to leave at the end of September because he has ended his term, the diplomat added. Kuwaiti officials did not immediately respond when asked to comment. Kuwait, where around 3,000 North Koreans live, has been hosting North Korea s sole diplomatic mission in the Gulf region. Kuwait s announcement comes after U.S. President Trump met with the Gulf state s ruler in Washington earlier this month.  Last month the Gulf country stopped direct flights to and from Pyongyang as well as halting entrance visas and commercial licenses, state news agency KUNA reported, citing an official at the foreign ministry. The Kuwait foreign ministry said at the time it was committed to implementing Security Council resolutions on North Korea, adding that it had stopped loans to the Asian state, banned imports and cut the numbers of its diplomats in the country.

Hurricane Irma worsens Latin America's fuel supply crunch,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Monster Hurricane Irma has shut down oil terminals across the northern Caribbean, worsening a fuel supply crunch in Latin America which is struggling to meet demand since Hurricane Harvey disrupted shipments from the U.S. Gulf Coast last month. Latin America had been scrambling for almost two weeks to find oil cargoes because of Harvey, which caused massive flooding in Texas and Louisiana, shutting down ports, refineries and production platforms. Irma, which is being followed by two hurricanes in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, was affecting Caribbean refineries, terminals and storage facilities. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Irma is the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean and one of the five most forceful storms to hit the Atlantic basin in 82 years. The Caribbean has the capacity to store more than 100 million barrels, which is crucial for those nations because of limited ability to refine crude, and also as supply for South American nations including Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia.  Several oil trading firms had moved a portion of their U.S. fuel inventories to the Caribbean ahead of Harvey so they could keep selling cargoes to Latin America, traders from two companies told Reuters.  Those barrels are now locked in terminals in St. Eustatius, Puerto Rico, the Bahamas and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as Irma, a Category 5 storm with winds of 185 mph (295 kph), was expected to hammer the region for several more days as it moves west-northwest.   Irma is arriving at a bad moment. Not all oil storage facilities in the Caribbean have closed, but vessel traffic is difficult in the middle of the storm. It will get worse before getting any better,  said a trader from an oil firm that rents tanks in St. Croix. Buckeye Partners LP (BPL.N), the largest owner of oil storage facilities in the Caribbean with 41.1 million barrels of capacity, shut its Puerto Rico terminal on Wednesday. It also plans to close BORCO, its largest terminal in the Bahamas that can store up to 26.2 million barrels, by the end of the day on Thursday, a source familiar with terminal operations said. Also in the Bahamas, Statoil s (STL.OL) South Riding Point terminal was open on Thursday, the company said. But traders added that plans to halt marine operations would likely start later on Thursday.  NuStar Energy LP (NS.N), which on Tuesday closed its 13-million-barrel Statia terminal on the small island of St. Eustatius, said several tanks and other equipment were damaged in the hurricane, so no restart date has been set. Firms using tanks in closed terminals in St. Eustatius, St. Croix, Bahamas and Puerto Rico include traders Vitol, Glencore (GLEN.L), Novum Energy and Freepoint Commodities, and oil firms PDVSA from Venezuela, China s Sinopec (600028.SS), Russia s Rosneft (ROSN.MM) and Lukoil (LKOH.MM), U.S. Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L), according to the sources and Reuters vessel data. As traders worry about Irma s impact on inventories, others see longer-term potential consequences from this or other storms, as both Jose, now in the Atlantic Ocean, and Katia, off Mexico s coast, continued moving on Thursday after strengthening to hurricanes.  If a hurricane with Irma s intensity strikes a terminal tank farm, the force of the storm at the eye wall will have destructive impact on the storage tanks, which are typically not designed to withstand those forces,  said Ernie Barsamian, chief executive officer of the Tank Tiger, a terminal storage clearinghouse. Mexican state-run oil company Pemex said on Thursday that its facilities have not been hit so far, but it keeps monitoring Katia s path to decide if further action was needed. Fuel importers such as Mexico and Brazil have secured supplies in recent days from the U.S. East Coast, Europe and the Caribbean, according to traders, regulators and oil firms. But those options are running short amid growing regional demand and limited offers from Texas refiners as ports have been slow to reopen for large vessels. The only option that traders see for desperate buyers in the coming days is to divert fuel cargoes from countries such as Brazil, which bought diesel in excess, or Venezuela, which cannot pay for all the fuel floating near its ports because of the country s fiscal problems. At least three fuel cargoes have been diverted from Venezuela since last week, according to Reuters data. All of them have changed their destinations to Panama, likely to pass the Canal before discharging in South America.   Companies from Uruguay, Ecuador, Peru and Costa Rica are seeking spot cargoes of diesel, gasoline, aviation gasoline, asphalt and components on the open market, but few providers are willing to participate, traders said.  I cannot use my inventories in the Caribbean at this moment to supply third parties,  one trader said. Dominican Republic refining firm Refidomsa, which declared force majeure last week on deliveries, has been rationing fuel from its 34,000-barrel-per-day Haina refinery, giving it enough inventory for 20 days.  Most Caribbean refineries are dependent on U.S. light oil since large regional crude producers such as Mexico and Venezuela have cut exports to some neighbors. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",0

" Republican Cop GOES OFF On The GOP, Slams Them For Being ‘Hypocrites’ And ‘Idiots’ (VIDEO)","Anyone following the current election has every right to be absolutely disgusted with the Republican party and the behavior of its candidates. Even more conservative Americans are coming around to the fact that the GOP hasn t been doing its part and is actually worsening the country while embarrassing us all.On Tuesday, Republican Sheriff Newell Normand had a moment of clarity during the Metropolitan Crime Commission s annual awards luncheon in Louisiana. Normand is a Republican himself, but he couldn t hold back his disappointment in the party when he slammed the GOP s elected officials and the state s former Governor, Bobby Jindal, in his speech.According to Normand, Jindal was a complete fool who made a mess of Louisiana s finances and was more like a cult leader than a governor. Admitting that he had once  endorsed that idiot , Normand was left disappointed and regretted standing behind Jindal once he was governor and left Louisiana in shambles. The enraged cop entertained the audience by calling Jindal out: What a mess. Bobby Jindal was a better cult leader than Jim Jones.  We drank the elixir for eight years, we remained in a conscious state, we walked to the edge of the cliff, we jumped off and he watched us. And guess what? Unlike Jim Jones, he did not swallow the poison. What a shame. Normand also accused Jindal of attempting to rewrite history by using social media to reframe his handling of the budget, even when the rest of the state doesn t  even know what history is.  Currently, Louisiana is facing a hefty budget shortfall of $2.5 billion, but Jindal is bragging on Twitter about what a great job he did as governor. Normand isn t having it. He said: We have to just say no! I m a Republican but I m not a hypocrite. We have to look at ourselves critically as a party and figure out where we are and what we re going to be about.

RIDICULOUS! SECRET SERVICE Investigating “Possible Threat” On Hillary By Former Trump Adviser,"Are they kidding? This was even a lead story on FOX News tonight! A former Trump adviser made a very general comment against Hillary Clinton and the Secret Service jumped all over him. You WILL NOT believe what he said! He stated that, Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason Does that sound like a credible threat to you? No, that s total BS! The things that have been said against Trump are unbelievable and yet nothing happens to those who threaten violence that s much more specific than Mr. Baldasaro s statement. Might we also mention Farrakhan who s constantly spewing hate speech and violent threats. The Secret Service is investigating a Donald Trump adviser who said in a radio interview that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton should be  shot for treason  on a  firing line. Al Baldasaro, a New Hampshire representative who serves on Trump s veterans  coalition and as a Trump delegate at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, said in an interview with a Boston talk radio host that Clinton should pay for the 2012 Benghazi attack. She is a disgrace for any, the lies she told those mothers about their children that got killed over there in Benghazi,  he said on the Jeff Kuhner Show Tuesday.  She dropped the ball on over 400 emails requesting back up security. Something s wrong there. Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason Via: abc7ny",politics,"Jul 20, 2016",1
" WH Staffer Explains Trump’s ‘Calm Before The Storm’ Comment, Proves He Shouldn’t Be POTUS (VIDEO)","By now, most of us   even conservatives   know that Donald Trump has no business being in the White House or running the country. Unfortunately for Trump, even the words of his own White House staffers can be used as evidence that he needs to be removed from office for his irresponsible behavior.According to Axios.com, an anonymous White House staffer stated that Trump s terrifying  calm before the storm  comment during a White House photo shoot didn t mean anything   Trump was just  trolling  the media.In an interview with MSNBC s Stephanie Ruhle this morning, Axios political reporter Jonathan Swan said: I think there s a high degree of probability that he s trolling everyone. Apparently, this anonymous White House source had told Swan Don t you get it? He s trolling all of you. America should be able to trust its president, but that s clearly not the case with Trump. Swan pointed this out that Trump was extremely irresponsible to play around like this. Swan noted that when surrounded by military leaders, to  troll  about something like that could have serious consequences.

 Trump Goes Full Birther — On Ted Cruz,"Donald Trump has revived the birther conspiracy theory, but this time he has targeted a fellow Republican: Ted Cruz.Cruz has begun creeping up in some state polls, particularly in evangelical-heavy Iowa, so as he has done in the past Trump went on the attack.Donald Trump said in an interview that rival Ted Cruz s Canadian birthplace was a  very precarious  issue that could make the Texas senator vulnerable if he became the Republican presidential nominee. Republicans are going to have to ask themselves the question:  Do we want a candidate who could be tied up in court for two years?  That d be a big problem,  Trump said when asked about the topic.  It d be a very precarious one for Republicans because he d be running and the courts may take a long time to make decision. You don t want to be running and have that kind of thing over your head. Trump added,  I d hate to see something like that get in his way. But a lot of people are talking about it and I know that even some states are looking at it very strongly, the fact that he was born in Canada and he has had a double passport. Trump is easily the most visible proponent of the birther conspiracy theory. Before the 2012 election, Trump made numerous national television appearances demanding that President Obama release his birth certificate. Trump even claimed that he had enlisted right-wing Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio to send a  cold case posse  to Hawaii to investigate Obama s past.The reality TV star even made a bizarre video requesting Obama s college records in order for the Hawaiian-born president to prove his citizenship.Senator Cruz s mother was a U.S. citizen when she gave birth to him in Calgary, Canada, which easily fulfills the requirement for someone to be a  natural-born citizen  of the United States. While Cruz s ideas may be repellent to the majority of citizens, he is easily eligible to be President of the United States.After years of trying to de-legitimize President Obama through two terms, it is odd to see the tactic turned against the right s own candidates. Like so much of their rhetoric, it resembles Frankenstein building his monster then watching it turn on him instead of his enemies.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 6, 2016",1
"Iranian president defends nuclear deal, says Trump can not undermine it","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani defended the nuclear deal with Western powers Saturday and said that U.S. President Donald Trump could not undermine it. Under the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to limit its disputed nuclear program in return for the easing of economic sanctions. However, Trump is expected to announce soon that he will decertify the deal, a senior administration official has said, in a step that potentially could cause the accord to unravel. “In the nuclear negotiations and agreement we reached issues and benefits that are not reversible. No one can turn that back, not Mr. Trump or anyone else,” Rouhani said at a ceremony at Tehran University marking the start of the university academic year, according to state media.  “Even if 10 other Trumps are created in the world, these are not reversible.” Trump, who has called the pact an “embarrassment” and “the worst deal ever negotiated”, has been weighing whether the deal serves U.S. security interests as he faces the Oct. 15 deadline for certifying that Iran is complying with its terms.     The prospect of Washington reneging on the deal has worried some of the U.S. allies that helped negotiate it, especially as the world grapples with another nuclear crisis, North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile development. If Trump does not certify that Iran is in compliance, the U.S. Congress will have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the deal. U.N. inspectors have verified Iranian compliance with the terms. Rouhani said Saturday that if the United States violated the deal then it would hurt its own reputation in the international community. “If America carries out any violations today, the whole world will condemn America. They will not condemn Iran,” Rouhani said, according to state media. “Then they will say why did you trust America and sign an agreement with them?” Separately, former Iranian president Mohammad Khatami has been forbidden from attending “public political, cultural and promotional ceremonies”, for a period of three months, two of his lawyers told the Iranian Labour News Agency (ILNA) on Saturday. Khatami has long been a lightning rod of criticism for hardliners who accuse him of fomenting unrest in the protests that followed the disputed election of president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009. Local media are forbidden from quoting Khatami in articles or publishing his image. The new restrictions were issued by Iranian security forces, Khatami’s lawyers told ILNA, and there does not appear to be any judicial mechanism to dispute the restrictions. In the lead-up to the presidential election last May, Khatami posted a message online encouraging his supporters to vote for Rouhani. Rouhani made a reference to the new restrictions placed on Khatami during his speech Saturday but did not name him. “If anybody repeats that people should come to the ballot box, they should be punished?” he said, according to ILNA. Khatami’s lawyers told ILNA that the restrictions began on the first day of the Iranian month of Mehr, which is Sept. 23.  ",politicsNews,"October 7, 2017 ",0

Kenya to charge opposition leader's sister with incitement to violence,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan authorities will arrest and charge the sister of opposition leader Raila Odinga with incitement to violence after attacks on the election board, the chief prosecutor s office said on Monday. Odinga has pulled out of the re-run of an election he was due to contest on Thursday against President Uhuru Kenyatta, saying problems with the election board meant the vote would not be fair. He has called for protests and a boycott and on Sunday said on Twitter there would be  no election .  We resume our picketing at IEBC (election board) offices countrywide on Tuesday and Wednesday. We maintain that there will be no election on Thursday,  he said, without giving details. Kenya is East Africa s richest economy and a trade and transport gateway as well as a hub for diplomacy and security, so its stability is considered vital for the region. Odinga s supporters disrupted a training session for election officials last week in the western city of Kisumu, which is his political stronghold. They attacked election staff and destroyed tents and polling material, witnesses said. Ruth Odinga, who is the opposition leader s sister and a former deputy governor of Kisumu county, was present at the protest, according to Reuters witnesses. Prosecutors instructed police to arrest her, opposition Senator Fred Outa and others. She will be charged with incitement, destruction of property, obstructing election officers and trespassing in an electoral center, according to a letter that the director of public prosecution s office posted online.   The suspects should immediately be charged,  the letter said. Neither Ruth Odinga nor Outa could immediately be contacted for comment. The arrests could anger Odinga s supporters and escalate tension over an election season that has divided the country and led to the deaths of at least 37 people since the first election was held on Aug. 8 including four in the last two weeks. Odinga says the election board had made insufficient reforms to prevent a repeat of the same mistakes that marred the previous presidential polls on Aug. 8. Kenyatta won that election but the Supreme Court last nullified the result, saying there had been procedural irregularities and a repeat must be held. The election board and Kenyatta say the poll will be held regardless of whether Odinga participates. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",0
U.S. Navy moving aircraft carrier for Hurricane Irma relief,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy said on Friday that it was moving the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln and other ships into position to provide humanitarian relief from Hurricane Irma if needed. The Abraham Lincoln, along with the amphibious assault ship Iwo Jima and transport dock ship New York, have left Norfolk, Virginia and are making their way south while trying to avoid the hurricane, U.S. officials said. A destroyer is expected to join them.  These ships are capable of providing medical support, maritime civil affairs, maritime security, expeditionary logistic support, medium and heavy-lift air support,  the statement said. In total, the four ships have three CH-53E Marine heavy lift helicopters, 10 MH-60S and 14 MH-60R Navy medium life helicopters. The Pentagon said the assault ship Wasp near the U.S. Virgin Islands was carrying out evacuations for critical patients from the island of St. Thomas to the larger St. Croix island. So far, 21 patients have been evacuated with another 23 evacuations planned for Friday, U.S. Northern Command said in a statement.  The U.S. Air Force said it had moved 50 F-16 fighter jets and more than 100 personnel from Shaw Air Force base in South Carolina to Louisiana. Military facilities in the path of the hurricane have ordered evacuations.  MacDill Air Force base in Tampa, home to U.S. Central Command which oversees military operations in the Middle East, ordered a mandatory evacuation. Marine Corps Recruit Depot in Parris Island, South Carolina, said it had authorized and encouraged non-essential military and civilian personnel to evacuate.  ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",0
London to set Northern Ireland budget as direct rule looms,"BELFAST/DUBLIN (Reuters) - The British government is to impose a budget on Northern Ireland for the first time in a decade, a major step toward imposing direct rule after attempts to form a power-sharing government in Belfast collapsed.  Many in the province fear direct rule would further destabilize a political balance between pro-British unionists and Irish nationalists that has already been upset by Britain s vote to leave the European Union.  The move also creates a headache for British Prime Minister Theresa May, whose minority government is dependent on Northern Ireland s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to pass legislation.  Irish Nationalists Sinn Fein and the pro-British DUP have shared power in Northern Ireland for a decade under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement, which ended three decades of violence that killed 3,600 people.  But Sinn Fein pulled out in January, complaining it was not being treated as an equal partner. The latest round of talks on re-establishing the devolved executive collapsed on Wednesday.  Sinn Fein is disappointed that the last few weeks of negotiations have ended in failure,  the party s leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle O Neill, told journalists.  But as you all know endless talks without conclusion are not sustainable.  Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said the party was open to further dialogue, but only if it was  meaningful .  DUP member of parliament Gregory Campbell accused Sinn Fein of holding back government in Northern Ireland with  a narrow political agenda , including a push for greater recognition for the Irish language.  In a sign that a resolution is unlikely in the coming weeks, Campbell appeared to dismiss a DUP compromise on language rights, saying his party  cannot and will not  elevate the Irish language  above all others . But party leader Arlene Foster was more positive, telling Ireland s RTE television that London setting a budget  doesn t stop us continuing to engage with Sinn Fein and trying to find a solution to the problems that we have .  Britain s minister for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire said as there was no immediate prospect of a new executive being formed he had no choice but to start the process of setting a budget from London to ensure funding for essential services.   This can t simply continue forever and a day ... There are decisions that have been stored up that have to be taken,  he told journalists.  The budget process could be handed back if agreement is reached between the two parties, he added. May and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar agreed in a telephone call that the gap between the two sides was narrow and that it was still possible to form an executive in Northern Ireland, Varadkar s office said in a statement on Thursday.  But Varakdar also said there could be no return to direct rule  as it existed prior to the Good Friday Agreement , a reference to the Irish government position that it should have a role in the governance of Northern Ireland if power-sharing is not restored. May replied that she also did not want direct rule, the statement said.  When Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney made the point in September that  there can be no British-only direct rule,  a British government spokesman responded by saying Britain would  never countenance  joint authority. Sinn Fein on Wednesday encouraged Dublin to play a role, saying the British and Irish governments should together  act urgently to deliver equality  in Northern Ireland.  On Wednesday, Coveney warned that the disagreement could complicate relations with London in the middle of delicate Brexit negotiations.   The prospect of direct rule in Northern Ireland and the Irish government s insistence on having a role in that - an appropriate role consistent with the Good Friday Agreement - is not where we want to be,  he told RTE radio.  Sinn Fein s Adams said that, in addition to Brexit, the agreement by the DUP to support May s government in London had helped to destabilize the province.   Don t underestimate the impact of the DUP-Tory pact in all of this,  he said.   ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",0
 WTF? Trump Demanded Comey’s ‘Loyalty’ At Private Dinner,"President Donald Trump told his account of a private dinner he had with James Comey to Lester Holt but now it appears a lot more happened that he didn t mention and a lot of what he said went on, didn t.According to Trump, the dinner was set for Comey to ask to keep his job. On its face, this is farcical. The FBI Director is appointed for terms of ten years so Comey didn t have to ask Trump to stay on. Secondly, Trump claims he asked Comedy about any investigation into the president and that the answer was,  You are not under investigation.  That doesn t make any more sense.Comey s side of the story is a lot different. According to the New York Times,  As they ate, the president and Mr. Comey made small talk about the election and the crowd sizes at Mr. Trump s rallies. The president then turned the conversation to whether Mr. Comey would pledge his loyalty to him. When Comey refused to offer such a pledge, Trump persisted. While Comey did say he would be honest with Trump, the New York Times is reporting that,  Mr. Comey declined to make that pledge. Instead, Mr. Comey has recounted to others, he told Mr. Trump that he would always be honest with him, but that he was not  reliable  in the conventional political sense. Loyalty has always been super important to Trump throughout his life. As a businessman, it makes sense. You need to know that your proprietary information is going to stay private. When you are the leader of the United States (or any other country), this is not the same thing. It reeks of dictatorship.Of course, the White House is pushing back hard on the claims that the dinner in question was not the way Comey describes it. That is not surprising. The White House seems to come away from most events, from the Inauguration to pretty much everything that happens everywhere, with a different view than the rest of us.Perhaps the best way to look at this is how Former Congressman John Dingell Tweeted:It's a bit wild to see the Trump administration begin the same way Nixon's ended.I'd be laughing my ass off if I weren't so damn worried.

But when Trump arrived at the Langley, Virginia, headquarters of the Agency, he was instead accompanied by Congressman Mike Pompeo.Here s what happened between Schumer and Cotton on Friday:The Senate reconvened after the inaugural ceremonies on Friday, with Pompeo s nomination set to come up at 4:50pm. Cotton angrily confronted Schumer about his broken promise. According to witnesses, Schumer told Cotton to lower his voice and asked him move off of the Senate floor to an adjacent hallway for a private discussion.  We need to take this out into the hallway,  Schumer said. Cotton walked with Schumer but loudly rejected his first request.  Don t tell me to lower my voice!  he shouted, with an additional salty admonition tacked on for emphasis. Burr and Cornyn were present, as was Senator Mark Warner, ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and several aides.Schumer told Cotton that the Senate had never previously confirmed a CIA director on Inauguration Day and if Cotton had been around eight years earlier, he d know that Republicans didn t extend that courtesy for incoming president Barack Obama.  Eight years ago, I was getting my ass shot at in Afghanistan,  Cotton snapped.  So don t talk to me about where I was 8 years ago. Cotton asked Schumer why he d gone back on his word. Schumer claimed that he d only been speaking for himself when he promised to let Pompeo through.  I said that I would not block him,  Schumer said, emphasizing the personal pronoun, according to sources who witnessed the exchange.  I never said that I could speak for 47 other Democrats. The Republicans were stunned.Senator Chuck Schumer is the poster boy for term limits.

 Ted Cruz About To Reintroduce Failed Pro-Hate Bill; Trump Likely To Sign It (VIDEO),"Barring something completely unforeseen, Donald Trump will be our new President in just a few weeks. That means that all personal liberties could fly right out the window, except for one: the liberty to discriminate based on who people love. Trump and the new Congress haven t even taken office yet and the legislative hatred has already begun.Ted Cruz, who s never met a gay person or a woman who didn t make him feel self-righteous, is expected to reintroduce the First Amendment Defense Act (FADA), which, despite its completely inoffensive name, is all about allowing bigots to freely discriminate. Trump is expected to sign it.In the text, the bill says that businesses can refuse service based on one of two beliefs, and both are ridiculous: that marriage  is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman  or  sexual relations are properly reserved to such a marriage. As for the second one, well, unless a couple is entering an establishment demanding space to specifically have sex, it doesn t seem there s ever a reason to declare that one. As for the first, marriage is what the law says it is, and the law says that marriage is between two consenting adults who get married. Okay, that s not the legal definition, but the Supreme Court, when Antonin Scalia was still alive, said that defining marriage is unconstitutional.The CEO of Equality Texas agrees that the proposed law shouldn t be a law at all. The legislation that Senator Cruz is proposing specifically elevates two narrow interpretations above any other religious practice,  Chuck Smith, CEO of Equality Texas said.  The bill is titled the First Amendment Defense Act, but in reality it is an unconstitutional attempt to totally redefine what the first amendment protects. Source: KXANIt would also put the Federal Government in the weird position of suing itself. The FADA would allow businesses to sue if the government wouldn t let them discriminate. The U.S. Attorney General would be required to defend the businesses against the government.Trump will likely sign the bill, at least according to his campaign s website: If I am elected president and Congress passes the First Amendment Defense Act, I will sign it to protect the deeply held religious beliefs of Catholics and the beliefs of Americans of all faiths. Here s the video:The other bad news is that by the time this reaches the Supreme Court, we will likely have another conservative justice.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images ",News,"December 28, 2016",1

In a BBC interview Monday evening, the 38-year-old criticized  the leading candidate on the Republican side  for proposing  building walls  and a temporary pause on Muslim immigration into the United States.She then paraphrased Trump and defended Muslims who she says are  not extremist or violent. If you actually look at what [Trump] specifically says in that now infamous speech about Muslims, he kept saying,  They only want jihad; they don t believe in our way of life; they don t respect our system,  she said.She continued:  And when he says  they  And, you know, you watch the media coverage afterwards and people should ve been saying,  Do you mean the 1.5 billion people around the world who fit that description? Do you mean the people who are U.S. citizens, who are members of your military, the vast majority of whom are not extremist or violent in any way?

If, at the end of all of this, he gets beaten by the person who becomes the first female president of the United States, then I think that would send a very positive message from the electorate back to him as to what they really think of those points of view,  Clooney said.She concluded:  I don t think they are U.S. values. Amal Clooney and her husband George both support Hillary Clinton s White House bid. Mr. Clooney, who has pushed for open borders, recently described Trump as a  xenophobic fascist  who want  ban Muslims from the country  during an interview with The Guardian.As Breitbart News has extensively reported in the past, the Clooneys have taken extensive measures to ensure they have privacy and security at their homes, including their $10 million Lake Como estate in Laglio, Northern Italy.Roberto Pozzi, mayor of Laglio, issued an ordinance in 2015 to protect the solace of the couple and their property.

MASSACHUSETTS VOTES TO IGNORE FED LAW and Let Illegals Go…This Sanctuary State Endangers All Americans!,"MASSACHUSETTS IS NOW A SANCTUARY STATE! The Massachusetts Supreme Court just ruled that illegals are to be released and not held under federal law. This puts all Americans at risk! Tucker Carlson previously interviewed a State Rep. who supports subverting federal law. Please listen to the skewed reasoning for not following federal law:In a ruling hailed by civil liberties advocates that ends a longstanding immigration enforcement practice, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court declared Monday that current state law  provides no authority for Massachusetts court officers to arrest and hold an individual solely on the basis of a Federal civil immigration detainer, beyond the time that the individual would otherwise be entitled to be released from State custody. State Representative James Lyons, an Andover Republican, said he is working with Republican Representatives Marc Lombardo of Billerica, and Shaunna O Connell of Taunton to gather co-sponsors on a bill he plans to file Tuesday or Wednesday. Lyons said the bill would be  straightforward,  giving Massachusetts police and court officers the power to arrest someone on a civil immigration warrant.  People are concerned about the rule of law,  Lyons told the News Service. Asked about how he thought the bill would fare in the Democrat-controlled Legislature, Lyons said,  Beacon Hill, I can t predict what s going on up there.  While the high court ruling focused on court officers, advocates said the opinion prohibits any state official from keeping someone jailed solely at the request of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  Going forward, nobody in Massachusetts should be held on an immigration detainer unless the Legislature were to attempt to change that,  said Emma Winger, Immigration Impact Unit staff attorney for the Committee on Public Counsel Services, who argued the case before the Supreme Judicial Court in April. It applies to anybody with arrest authority,  said Laura Rotolo, staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts. Rotolo said that while many jurisdictions have limited their cooperation with ICE, the SJC is the first state high court to rule against ICE detainers.Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson said the decision will make people more vulnerable to crime in Massachusetts.  I wouldn t say it makes Massachusetts a sanctuary state.

Kosovo police arrested 19 people in November 2016 on suspicion that they had links with the Islamic State militant group and were planning attacks in Kosovo and neighboring Albania. Nine of them were charged. The state prosecutor said some of them were in contact with Lavdrim Muhaxheri, Islamic State s self-declared  commander of Albanians in Syria and Iraq , who ordered them to attack. Police said Muhaxheri was killed in June this year.  ... I accept guilty plea,  defendant Kenan Plakaj said in court. He is accused of making explosives, after police found half a kilo of explosives at his house, the indictment said. The other defendant, Besart Peci, also pleaded guilty. Sentences were not announced. Another defendant facing trial had kept in his basement 283 grams of self-made explosives. The same triacetone triperoxide explosive was used in attacks in Paris and Brussels and has been found in various foiled bombings in Europe since 2007. No militant attacks have been staged in Kosovo, whose population is largely ethnic Albanian Muslim. But at least 200 people have been detained or investigated over offences related to Islamic State, and a total of 300 Kosovars have gone to Syria to fight for Islamic State. More than 70 have been killed. International and local security agencies in Kosovo are worried that many of those returning from combat zones will pose a security threat. In 2015, Kosovo adopted a law introducing jail sentences of up to 15 years for anyone found guilty of fighting in wars abroad. ",worldnews,"December 20, 2017 ",0
FIDEL CASTRO MOCKS President Obama…Blasts Him For Meddling In Communist Country’s Affairs,"B..b b but what about the wave the baseball game, the posing in front of Che Guevara artwork? We were under the impression that our communist leader and Cuba s communist leader had an understanding, or at least a special bond between kindred spirits Fidel Castro   speaking out for the first time since President Obama s historic visit to Cuba   blasted the US leader for trying to meddle in his country s affairs.In a letter titled  Brother Obama  and published Monday in El Granma, the official state newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party, the island nation s former president scoffed,  We don t need the empire to give us any presents. Castro, 89, ripped Obama for assuming that Cuba trusted him when he said the US government is done trying to overthrow the Communist regime and that this will help the island move more quickly toward economic and political reform. My modest suggestion is that he reflects and doesn t try to develop theories about Cuban politics,  Castro said. No one should pretend that the people of this noble and selfless country will renounce its glory and its rights,  he wrote.  We are capable of producing the food and material wealth that we need with the work and intelligence of our people. He even took a swipe at Obama s relative youth. Native populations do not exist at all in the minds of Obama. Nor does he say that racial discrimination was swept away by the Revolution; that retirement and salary of all Cubans were enacted by this before Mr. Barack Obama was 10 years old,  Castro said.Obama had said in a speech that  it is time, now, for us to leave the past behind,  but the diehard Commie retorted,  I imagine that any one of us ran the risk of having a heart attack on hearing these words from the President of the United States. Castro ceded power to his brother Raul in 2008. Obama met with Raul last week, the first time a US president had been to Cuba since 1928. Via: NYP",left-news,"Mar 28, 2016",1

 Trump Accidentally Says He Wants Single Payer In Latest Tweet – Twitter Lets Him Know (TWEETS),"It can easily be said that Donald Trump is a few sandwiches short of a picnic, and he just proved that fact once again with his latest tweet.Trump, since the start of his campaign, has been telling everyone that he s going to get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something better, and quite honestly if his latest tweet is what he wants   liberals will likely get on board. However, in his idiocy, he probably doesn t realize what he just said.Trump tweeted out: Of course the Australians have better healthcare than we do  everybody does. ObamaCare is dead!

They take out the middleman of for-profit insurance, and give direct, affordable care, only increasing taxes slightly, and you no longer have the added expense of insurance premiums. AND EVERYONE IS COVERED.Now, this isn t likely what Trump meant to say, but it is what he said.The American Health Care Act, better known as Trumpcare, that passed yesterday in the House is simply a gift to the wealthy while stripping insurance and necessary benefits from those who need it most.

HERE’S WHY HILLARY CLINTON FORBIDS PRESS From Taking Photos Of Private Jet Travel THAT COSTS MILLIONS,"Eureka! We figured out why Hillary won t let the press see her off: The campaign of Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton has poured more than $2 million into the use of private jets this election cycle, according to a review of its expenditures.Federal Election Commission documents reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon found that Hillary for America made a total of 48 payments from June 1, 2015, to Jan. 29, 2016, to Executive Fliteways, a New York-based private jet company, running up a tab of $2,128,293 for the campaign.Executive Fliteways is considered  one of the largest independently owned and operated charter companies in the country  and boasts a fleet of private planes ranging from  mid-size,  which can seat seven or eight passengers, to  heavy,  which can carry 12 to 16 people.While it is not clear which jet Clinton prefers on the campaign trail, or if they routinely switch between the jets they use, Clinton has been pinned on Executive Fliteways  Falcon 900B  heavy jet  in the past, according to a media reports. Hillary boarded the plane, which burns 347 gallons of fuel per hour, shortly after laying out her campaign s plan to combat global warming.ABC REPORTER Liz Kreutz TWEETED OUT THIS MESSAGE WITH A PHOTO:     Clinton staff won t allow press to film HRC boarding her charter.

#BlackPrivilegedLives: Truth Behind The (Not So) Poor Oppressed Black Mizzou Student Who Went On “Hunger Strike” Over “White Privilege” [Video],"We ll wait for Nancy Pelosi to call this movement exactly what it is an  astro-turf  movement. The  hate cops  and  hate white people  movement is a George Soros funded, Obama, Eric Holder and Al Sharpton inspired movement created to pit  the haves  and the  have nots  against each other. To hell with America and it s great people, this is about something much more important to the Left, it s about a divided nation totally dependent upon the government.No justice no peace! We have nothing to lose but our chains  -Jonathan Butler, son of very successful multi-millionaire parents.Jonathan Butler, a central figure in the protests at the University of Missouri, is an Omaha native and the son of a railroad vice president, the Omaha World-Herald reports.Butler refused food last week in a move to force the university system s president, Timothy M. Wolfe, from office. Wolfe resigned Monday and Butler ended his hunger strike.Jonathan Butler played high-school football at Omaha Central High, where he won a state championship, and earned a bachelor s degree in business administration from Mizzou, the newspaper reports. He is working toward a master s degree in educational leadership and policy.He is a member of a prominent Omaha family. The newspaper says that Butler s father is Eric L. Butler, executive vice president for sales and marketing for the Union Pacific Railroad. His 2014 compensation was $8.4 million, according to regulatory filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Via: SLTButler s turn from silent type to activist wasn t a complete surprise to his old football coach, Jay Ball, who remembered how Butler worked hard to bulk himself up in order to make the move from the junior varsity team to varsity. In his senior year, Butler started on a team that won the state title.Ball said Butler wasn t a big guy   standing about 5-foot-9, tops. But Ball practically had to kick Butler out of the weight room because the aspiring player spent so much time there, pushing himself.  I can remember watching him squat,  Ball said.  His eyeballs bulged out. Ball said Butler led by example, not rah-rah bravado.  He was really smart,  Ball said,  a very coachable kid. Ball said Butler s drive, tenacity and effort probably served him well these past weeks.In his senior yearbook, Butler is shown twice: once in a tie for his class portrait and once in a tiny football team photograph. According to teachers and administrators, he was not the kind of student who organized events or served on the student council. Instead, he was a quiet, solid student who paid attention.Now Butler is the public face of a protest that drew national attention and felled two top leaders. Butler and others have said he s not the center   several women at Mizzou plus the school s student body president took more public positions earlier. But his hunger strike, which stretched for eight days, seems to have been the catalyst.Where did this activism come from?Butler did not respond to a World-Herald reporter s requests for interviews. His parents declined to comment. They traveled to Missouri on Monday. A family friend described the family as incredibly humble and low profile.Butler has said in news reports that his paternal grandfather, an attorney helping the poor in New York City, was a big influence. So were his parents: Eric is a Union Pacific executive and Cynthia is a former educator who runs an advocacy program. They founded Joy of Life Ministries in their basement, and it has grown into a church now based at 56th Street and Sorensen Parkway.Butler has said that the police shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson in 2014 and the subsequent protests there marked a turning point for him. He spent time in Ferguson, a two-hour drive from Columbia, lending his voice two summers ago.Here is Butler, the self proclaimed speaking to students.  I am a revolutionary.

Clinton leads Trump by 11 points in White House race: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"(Reuters) - Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by 11 points in the U.S. presidential race, showing little change after she became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee this week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday.   The online poll, conducted from Monday to Friday, shows 46 percent of likely voters support Clinton while 34.8 percent back Trump. Another 19.2 percent support neither candidate. Their parties hold conventions in July ahead of a Nov. 8 election. Clinton’s lead was nearly the same a week ago, before she had amassed enough convention delegates to win the nomination and before Trump drew criticism from leaders of both parties for questioning the impartiality of a Mexican-American judge. Trump, 69, enjoyed a bigger boost after becoming the presumptive Republican nominee in May. Having trailed Clinton, 68, for most of the year, Trump briefly erased a double-digit gap and pulled about even with the former secretary of state. Clinton this week defeated party rival Bernie Sanders, 74, in four of six nominating contests, most notably California and New Jersey, and won the endorsements of President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and other party leaders. Trump this week sparred with party leaders and struggled with questions about his now-defunct Trump University. A lawsuit accuses Trump and the for-profit school of defrauding thousands of people, including many who paid as much as $35,000 to learn Trump’s real estate strategies.  A wealthy businessman who asserts the lawsuit is politically motivated, Trump said presiding U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel was biased against him because of Trump’s plans to build a wall on the border with Mexico. Trump later added that Muslim judges could be biased against him also because of his pledge to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country. Trump’s comments drew sharp criticism from Republican leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Trump later said he would no longer talk about the judge. Friday’s results had 1,276 respondents and a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3.2 percentage points.

He was attending the ranch with about 40 other people.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued this statement after the news of Scalia s passing: He was the solid rock who turned away so many attempts to depart from and distort the Constitution. We mourn his passing, and we pray that his successor on the Supreme Court will take his place as a champion for the written Constitution and the Rule of Law. Cecilia and I extend our deepest condolences to his family, and we will keep them in our thoughts and prayers.

COMMUNIST Students THREATEN “Students For Trump” Event [VIDEO] How Much Longer Will Americans Allow Violent Left To Shut Down Free Speech?,"The breaking point is fast approaching in a divided America Obama couldn t have hoped for a better outcome in the final year of his failed presidency. Americans fighting Americans over race, religion and sexual orientation. Violence and threats are being used against anyone who disagrees with the Left, while Alinsky trained activists continue to be inspired by radicals like Obama and funded by radicals like Communist George Soros. The first meeting of Portland State University s Students for Trump group was loudly interrupted and shut down by anti-Trump protesters, who barged into the group s meeting on Thursday evening.A video released by the students shows Anti-Trump protesters causing a significant disruption at the meeting, which was a closed event for members of the club.Although the conversation was initially civil, it eventually progressed into name-calling and shouting. An Anti-Trump protester threatened a student that was filming the scene:  Point that f**king camera at me  Wait  til that camera is not there do you want to get f**ked up by a f**king faggot? After a protester took to standing on top of a table to address the crowd, a pro-Trump student suggested that starting a  Students Against Trump  group would have been a more productive way to combat pro-Trump students at PSU. The only way to combat this shit is to join an organization that has an anti-racist, anti-capitalist stance,  another protester claimed.  You need to get out of the fucking way and let people of color let these people organize themselves. Despite the meeting being a closed event for the club, the protesters demanded the right to speak. When a few pro-Trump students tried to calm down a protester yelling from atop a table, another protester yelled,  If you don t let her talk, I will f**k shit up. Although the disruption primarily led to shouting and name-calling, there were some productive discussions that happened amongst the chaos. One pro-Trump student explained that his own parents had gone through a lot to immigrate legally:  My family are immigrants, they paid thousands and thousands of dollars, they waited years. I don t see why it s fair to let anyone   we don t know who they are, they could be criminals, they could anything   just waltz through the country with no repercussions.

Florida nightclub massacre prompts Rubio to reconsider political future,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, who announced his retirement from the Senate after ending his Republican presidential bid in March, said on Monday he would reconsider his future after being urged to seek re-election in the aftermath of the Orlando nightclub massacre.   The Florida Republican told radio host Hugh Hewitt in an interview that the worst mass shooting in U.S. history “most certainly has impacted my thinking in general, at least, about a lot of things.” But Rubio said he has not considered the rampage from a political perspective. “When it visits your home state, when it impacts a community you know well, it really gives you pause to think a little bit about your service to your country and where you can be most useful to your country,” Rubio said. “My family and I will be praying about all this and we’ll see what I need to do next with my life in regards to how I can best serve.”   Hewitt urged Rubio to remain in the Senate, describing the lawmaker who sits on the Senate intelligence and foreign relations committees as one of the “very few people” who know the security issues raised by Sunday’s rampage. News of the interview brought an attack on Rubio’s voting record from Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada, who referred to the Republican repeatedly as “the junior senator” from Florida.  “How can he speak of running for office again when he voted to let potential terrorists buy assault weapons and explosives?” Reid asked on the floor of the Senate. “That is how he voted. The junior senator voted against every gun safety measure.” Rubio, who is also seen as a potential vice presidential running mate for Republican Donald Trump, announced that he would retire from the Senate and take a break from politics after losing Florida’s presidential primary in March to Trump. Before Sunday, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and others had urged him to seek re-election, citing polling data that showed he would win re-election and help Republicans retain their Senate majority. Rubio has backed his friend and fellow Republican, Florida Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez-Cantera, in Florida’s August primary contest for his Senate seat.    If he were to run for re-election, Rubio would have to decide by a June 24 filing deadline. ",politicsNews,"June 13, 2016 ",0
China proposed three-phase plan for Rohingya issue,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China has proposed a three-phase plan for resolving the Rohingya crisis, starting with a ceasefire, that has won the support of Myanmar and Bangladesh, the Foreign Ministry said. More than 600,000 Muslim Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since late August driven out by a military clearance operation in Buddhist majority Myanmar s Rakhine State. The Rohingyas  suffering has caused an international outcry. Visiting the Myanmar capital Naypyitaw, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China believed that the issue could be addressed by a solution acceptable to neighbors Myanmar and Bangladesh through consultations. A ceasefire should be followed by bilateral dialogue to find a workable solution, the ministry website reported late on Sunday. The third and final phase should be to work toward a long-term solution. Wang said a ceasefire was basically in place already, and the key now was to prevent a flare-up. He hoped the two sides could soon sign and implement an agreement already reached on repatriation. The international community and the United Nations Security Council should give encouragement and support to both countries  to create the necessary conditions and a good environment , it quoted Wang as saying at a joint press conference with Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar s de facto leader. Myanmar was supportive of the Chinese plan, as was Bangladesh, where Wang visited earlier in the weekend. In Dhaka Wang said the international community should not complicate the situation.

Red Cross halts aid to swathe of South Sudan after staff member killed,"ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - The Red Cross has halted operations across a third of South Sudan after gunmen shot dead a staff member, in what the U.N. said on Wednesday was the biggest such suspension during the country s four-year civil war. Kennedy Laki Emmanuel, a driver for the Red Cross, died on Sept. 8 when gunmen fired on a 10-vehicle convoy delivering aid in South Sudan s restive Western Equatoria state. In response, the International Committee of the Red Cross shut down activities across Equatoria, a region roughly the size of Britain that borders Congo and Uganda and has seen some of the heaviest fighting over the last year. The suspension affected more than 22,000 people about to get aid deliveries from the Red Cross. That included more than 5,000 farmers due to receive seeds in an area teetering on the edge of famine.       The ICRC will not resume anything until we have a clear picture of exactly what happened and until we receive the necessary security guarantees,  spokeswoman Mari Mortvedt told Reuters. The security of the ICRC staff is top priority.  The U.N. s Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  told Reuters that no aid group had shut down its operations over such a large area since South Sudan s civil war began in 2013.  The conflict began after President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, fired his deputy Riek Machar, an ethnic Nuer. The U.N. says ethnic cleansing has taken place and warned of genocide, amid reports of murder, rape, and torture of civilians. More than two million South Sudanese have now fled the country, creating Africa s biggest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide, and more than half of those remaining need food aid. The country s original population was 12 million.  At least 85 aid workers have been killed, according to the U.N., including 18 this year, making it the deadliest country for aid workers in the world. That number did not include a staff member for aid group World Vision, killed in the Western Equatoria town of Yambio on September 3. It was not clear whether that death was related to his work as an aid worker, so it was not included in the total, the group said.

Poll gives New Zealand's Nationals nine point lead after final TV debate before vote,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand s ruling National Party regained a wide lead over the opposition Labour Party in an opinion poll on Wednesday after party leaders went head-to-head in the final debate before Saturday s election. It was the second poll in recent weeks to show Prime Minister Bill English s party, which has held power for a decade, holding a near double-digit lead. The poll boosted the New Zealand dollar to $0.7375 - its highest in over six weeks.  The One News-Colmar Brunton poll showed the National Party jumped 6 points to 46 percent, while Labour slumped by seven points to 37 percent. But opinion polls have been very volatile and have largely indicated the race is still too close to call. The New Zealand First party, which could emerge as a possible kingmaker for the next government, saw support fall right to the threshold needed for a seat in parliament. Despite the fall in support for New Zealand First, led by Winston Peters, the debate still centered around its potential deciding role to English s frustration.  I am suggesting to the voters that they cut the middle men, I don t like this view that Mr Peters has that he decides who the government of New Zealand is,  English said. Both English and rival Labour leader Jacinda Ardern said their parties were  neck and neck  in the contest regardless of the latest opinion poll.  I remain an absolutely optimistic person when it comes to this campaign,  Ardern said during the debate. Having become leader in August the 37-year-old Ardern has invigorated Labour, and at times opinion polls have showed the party comfortably ahead. During the debate, Ardern at times appear to notch up points. She criticized the government for not having taken any measures to avoid the kind of infrastructure failure that caused widespread disruption to air travel this week, when a burst pipeline led to a fuel shortage. Minor parties often have an outsize role in New Zealand s proportional representation system, in which a party, or combination of parties, needs 61 of Parliament s 120 members - usually about 48 percent of the vote - to form a government. Support for New Zealand First dropped 1 point to 5 percent. The Green Party, with which Labour has a working agreement, rose 1 point to 8 percent. Together with the Greens, voter support for Labour was near that for National in the poll.  More than any election since 1996, it s going to be the minor parties that ultimately decide which of Labour or National end up governing,  Bryce Edwards, analyst at Wellington-based Critical Politics. Ardern reiterated her first call would be to the Green Party but that this did not necessarily mean a coalition with them.  We ve said we ll have a phone call, that doesn t mean it s a stitched up, done deal,  she said. ",worldnews,"September 20, 2017 ",0
"EU and Iran defend nuclear deal, under fire from Trump","SAMARKAND, Uzbekistan (Reuters) - Senior officials from the European Union and Iran spoke up on Friday in defense of the agreement limiting Tehran s nuclear program, as the pact comes under heavy pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump. The nuclear deal was  a major achievement of European and international multilateral diplomacy , EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini told a conference in Uzbekistan.  The European Union will make sure it will continue to be fully implemented by all, in all its parts,  she said. Trump on Oct. 13 dealt a blow to the pact by refusing to certify that Tehran was complying with the accord, under which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions. International inspectors said it was complying. The U.S. Congress has until mid-December to decide whether to reimpose sanctions lifted by the deal.  Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also spoke on Friday at the United Nations-sponsored conference on Central Asian security and development in Samarkand.  By clinching the nuclear deal and fulfilling all our commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, we have in action proved our compliance with the principle of non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament,  he said, without mentioning Trump directly. Mogherini said the EU s ties with ex-Soviet Central Asia were at an all-time high following moves by Uzbekistan s new government to open up the previously isolated nation. Mogherini, the first EU foreign policy chief to visit Uzbekistan in four years, met President Shavkat Mirziyoyev as well as foreign ministers of all five Central Asian nations. Mirziyoyev was elected president last December after the death of his authoritarian predecessor Islam Karimov, who was accused of systematic human rights abuses and whose relations with the West were poor. Seeking to modernize Uzbekistan s economy, Mirziyoyev has moved to mend those relations and announced an ambitious reform program at home. After a  very long and fruitful meeting  with Mirziyoyev, Mogherini said the reforms had the full support of Brussels. Mirziyoyev has also improved ties with neighboring Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan after years of bitter standoffs over matters such as borders and water use, winning further praise from Mogherini.  I would say that we are at the top of our historical experience of cooperation, but we want to use it not as a target point, but as a starting point,  she said. ",worldnews,"November 10, 2017 ",0

 Nobody Can Make Sense Of What Donald Trump Is Saying In This Video — Is It Even English?,"By his own admission, Donald Trump screwed up his answer in an MSNBC town hall meeting hosted by Chris Matthews. In the event, Trump said he believed abortion should be banned, and that if such a law had come to pass, women who had abortions should be  punished. Trump was immediately condemned not just by pro-choice groups, but by conservative Republican groups, who push for making abortion illegal but don t like to deal with the unpopular fallout that would come with making those laws (if abortion is murder, both women and their doctors would be committing a crime).Trump walked back the statement soon after. Perhaps he was too intoxicated with wrapping up the nomination on Wednesday morning, but MSNBC s Willie Geist asked him about the abortion question and his response, and absolute gibberish came out:TRUMP: He was asking me a theoretical, or just a question in theory, and I talked about it only from that standpoint. Of course not. And that was done, he said, you know, I guess it was theoretically, but he was asking me a rhetorical question, and I gave an answer. And by the way, people thought from an academic standpoint, and asked rhetorically, people said that answer was an unbelievable academic answer. But of course not, and I said that afterwards. Everybody understands that.He would have probably been better off with his deeply unpopular answer in the first MSNBC interview, or even the subsequent apologies and tapdancing. Instead, as he so often has during the campaign, Trump tries to sound smarter than he is and gets tied up.Of course, especially 0n the very Trump-friendly Morning Joe, he wasn t asked to clarify his comments or even tell viewers what planet he beamed them in from in order to make heads or tails of it.Featured image via YouTube",News,"May 5, 2016",1
Virginia Republican Goodlatte will not seek re-election,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Bob Goodlatte, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said on Thursday he will not seek re-election next year. “This is a natural stepping-off point,” Goodlatte said in a statement. The announcement came on the heels of Tuesday’s elections in Virginia, where Democrats won the governor’s office and triumphed in local races in some Republican strongholds. Goodlatte has represented Virginia’s 6th congressional district for 25 years.  He joins a string of Republican lawmakers who have announced their retirements from Congress in recent weeks.  Two other House committee chairmen, Representatives Lamar Smith and Jeb Hensarling, both of Texas, said last week they would not seek re-election.

 Matt Damon Just Revealed A HUGE Secret About How Narcissistic Trump Really Is,"Donald Trump is an insane narcissist. We all know that. However, actor Matt Damon just revealed just how bad Trump s narcissism is   and it is positively frightening when it comes to such a person having the nuclear codes. As we re all well aware, Donald Trump owns bunches of gaudy buildings around the world. Since they are so unusual, it s only natural that they could be great locations for shooting movies. However, with Trump being Trump, there was a crazy catch that showed just how much of a narcissistic bully the orange man that is currently squatting in the Oval Office is.Apparently, in order to have access to Trump s buildings for the purpose of filming, directors were forced to allow Trump to have a part in whatever was being filmed. Damon says of this bizarre detail: The deal was that if you wanted to shoot in one of his buildings, you had to write him in a part. Martin Brest had to write something in  Scent of a Woman    and the whole crew was in on it. You have to waste an hour of your day with a bullshit shot: Donald Trump walks in and Al Pacino s like,  Hello, Mr. Trump!    you had to call him by name   and then he exits. You waste a little time so that you can get the permit, and then you can cut the scene out. But I guess in  Home Alone 2 they left it in. Damon went on to express dismay at the way Trump is running the nation and says of Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation into the Russian hacking that took place in the 2016 election: [H]opefully his investigation is going smoothly. He can t wrap things up soon enough, as far as I m concerned. Damon also had quite a few things to say about Trump s white supremacist fan boys: [T]o see these young, aggrieved, white boys walking with their torches and screaming  Jews will not replace us!  It was just shocking. Then the night that the president [made his]  many sides  comment was absolutely abhorrent. Matt Damon is right on all accounts. It is shocking. Everything that is happening is shocking, and not in a good way. Donald Trump is destabilizing our democracy right before our very eyes, and the people in a position to do something about it will do nothing. Hopefully, Mueller finishes up soon, and we get rid of these people post haste.Featured image via Bill Pugliano/Getty Images",News,"September 1, 2017",1

U.S. sentencing reform backers cite success at state level,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As the Senate’s top Republican mulls whether to push ahead on a criminal justice reform package, the bill’s advocates say its power to cut crime is on display in his own back yard. Mitch McConnell, the Senate’s Republican leader, represents Kentucky, one of a handful of states that have had some success with sentencing reform and reducing violent crime. Violent crime rates are down nationwide since President Barack Obama’s first term, but states such as Kentucky have seen it fall more steeply than the national rate. Kentucky’s imprisonment rate also declined after it reduced sentences for certain drug offenders and passed a policy to release some prisoners to community supervision before the end of their sentences in 2011. The policy saved the state more than $29 million over two-and-a-half years, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts, a policy research group. McConnell could move forward in the Senate with a reform measure that would lower mandatory minimum sentences for some nonviolent federal drug offenders and permit judges to rehear cases with those new sentences in mind. It is backed by the Obama administration and a bipartisan group of 30 senators. The federal measure “has been informed by success stories” in states that have passed similar laws over the past decade, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told Reuters.  “I’m confident that we would see similar results if Congress were to pass important reforms at the federal level,” she said. McConnell in January vowed to bring “everybody in the Republican Conference up to speed... before any decision is made about floor time” since the bill has so far been discussed mainly in the Senate Judiciary Committee. McConnell spokesman Don Stewart said he had no new announcements on the bill’s prospects for advancement. Some Republicans oppose it, such as Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, who says parts of the proposal applying to armed drug offenders would “release thousands of violent felons.” But sponsors of the Senate package cite state-level success in arguing for the federal reforms. “While I am excited about our federal prospects, the fact is that we could not have gotten to this point if it were not for the great reforms that Utah and other ‘red’ states around the country are enacting,” Republican Utah Senator Mike Lee told Reuters, referring to states that predominantly support the Republican Party. Thirty states reduced crime and imprisonment rates simultaneously between 2009 and 2014, Pew said, with 18 of those states’ crime rates falling faster than the national rate. Utah last year lowered penalties for certain drug offenses. It also restricted prison beds to only the most serious offenders through a law the state expects to nearly flatline prison growth over the next 20 years and save $542 million. The U.S. Sentencing Commission estimates more than 12,000 prisoners - about six percent of the federal prison population - would be eligible to have their cases reheard under the Senate bill. A parallel package of bills in the House of Representatives also awaits a floor vote.  Earlier this month, Justice Action Network hired McConnell’s former chief of staff, Hunter Bates, to lobby for the bill. Bates told Reuters that McConnell is “not quite ready” to advance the bill yet, but that it is on a “short list” of bills that have a shot at becoming law in 2016.

"Factbox: Merkel's conservatives, SPD set out policy lines for German coalition","(Reuters) - Momentum in Germany is building for a new  grand coalition  between Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservative bloc and the Social Democrats (SPD) to end the political instability created by the collapse of her coalition talks with other parties. The conservatives and SPD have ruled together for the last four years and most ministers are keeping their posts in an interim government until a new coalition or minority government is formed. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier hosts a first meeting of Merkel, the head of Bavaria s CSU conservatives, Horst Seehofer, and SPD leader Martin Schulz on Thursday.  Here are some of the overlaps and differences in policy areas likely to be discussed in any coalition talks. Merkel has stressed she wants to maintain Germany s solid finances. Germany has run a budget surplus since 2014 under the stewardship of her hardline conservative finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble. She has also said she wants some tax cuts, mainly for low and medium earners.  The SPD is far more focused on boosting spending and has in the last few days said it wants to increase investment in education and homes as well as on infrastructure. The SPD wants to increase inheritance tax, some in the party want to insist on raising the minimum wage and it fought the election on a pledge of keeping pensions stable.  The conservatives and SPD both want to increase spending to expand broadband.  An area of possible conflict. Since the election, Merkel has bowed to pressure from her Bavarian allies to put a cap on the number of people Germany will accept on humanitarian grounds. Merkel repeated on Saturday that she wanted to limit the number to about 200,000 a year.  The SPD opposes this, arguing it breaches the constitution s guarantee of asylum to people who are persecuted for political reasons. Some leading party members have said they will not agree to a cap. The SPD is more positive than Merkel s cautious stance towards French President Emmanuel Macron s proposals for a euro zone budget and a euro zone finance minister. The SPD also backs the idea of turning the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) bailout fund into a European Monetary Fund along the lines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  There is little difference on approach to Brexit talks. Broad agreement on most areas of foreign policy, including with the United States and Turkey. The SPD puts greater emphasis on mending ties with Russia which have been hurt by the conflict in Ukraine, but this is more a matter of nuance than a deep policy rift. Also agreement on armed forces missions abroad although the SPD is more skeptical on NATO demands to move towards increasing defense spending to 2 percent of gross domestic product by 2014. The SPD fought its election on the platform of social justice and wants to improve the lot of the less affluent. A long-standing commitment which several senior SPD members have repeated recently is the idea of making health insurance fairer for everyone by introducing a  citizen s insurance . The SPD also wants to ensure men and women have equal pay and working conditions.  ",worldnews,"November 26, 2017 ",0
Trump's U.N. nominee to blast world body over Israel: testimony,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations will blast the world body over its treatment of Israel at her Senate confirmation hearing, according to prepared testimony seen by Reuters on Tuesday. “Nowhere has the UN’s failure been more consistent and more outrageous than in its bias against our close ally Israel,” Republican South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley said in the opening remarks for her appearance on Wednesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “Any honest assessment also finds an institution that is often at odds with American national interests and American taxpayers,” the speech says. In the remarks, Haley offered some praise for UN activities, such as health and food programs that have saved millions of lives, weapons monitoring and some peacekeeping missions, in something of a departure from Trump, who has disparaged the United Nations. Other Trump national security nominees, notably his choices for Secretary of State, former Exxon Mobil Corp chairman Rex Tillerson, and Secretary of Defense, retired Marine General James Mattis, have also broken from the Republican president-elect in testimony before the Senate. Noting that the United States contributes 22 percent of the UN budget, far more than any other country, Haley asked, “Are we getting what we pay for?” She promised to work with U.S. lawmakers to pursue what she described as “seriously needed change” at the United Nations. Some Republican lawmakers, led by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, have threatened to cut U.S. funding for the United Nations after the Security Council adopted a Dec. 23 resolution demanding an end to settlement building by Israel. Graham will introduce Haley at her hearing. ",politicsNews,"January 17, 2017 ",0
Republican wins Montana special election despite assault charge,"BOZEMAN, Mont. (Reuters) - Republican Greg Gianforte defeated a political novice to win Montana’s seat in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday, barely 24 hours after he was charged with assaulting a reporter who asked him about the Republican healthcare bill. A race that was expected to be a test of President Donald Trump’s political influence ahead of next year’s U.S. congressional elections was jolted by the charge against Gianforte, a wealthy technology executive who had urged voters to send him to Congress to help Trump. Speaking to cheering supporters in Bozeman after his win, Gianforte apologized for the incident and said he was not proud of his actions. “I should not have responded the way I did, and for that I’m sorry,” Gianforte said. “I should not have treated that reporter that way.” Gianforte beat Democrat Rob Quist, a banjo player and first-time candidate who had focused his campaign on criticism of the Republican effort to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama’s healthcare law. CNN projected Gianforte would win. With 96 percent of the vote counted, he led Quist by 51 percent to 43 percent. Gianforte prevailed despite being charged on Wednesday night with misdemeanor assault on Ben Jacobs, a political correspondent for the U.S. edition of the Guardian newspaper, who said the candidate “body-slammed” him during a campaign event in Bozeman. Gianforte’s victory is a boost for Republicans, who are worried Trump’s political stumbles and the unpopularity of the healthcare bill passed by the House will hurt their chances of holding on to a 24-seat House majority in next year’s elections. But the relatively close margin of the race in Republican-leaning Montana was encouraging to Democrats, who are already focused on next month’s hotly contested special House election in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia. Gianforte had been favored to win in Montana, where Republicans have held the lone House seat for two decades and where Trump won by more than 20 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election. The race had grown closer in the last week, however, as Quist focused on criticism of the House healthcare bill.  Quist, wearing his signature cowboy hat, told supporters in Missoula, Montana, that the grassroots energy of his campaign would continue. “I know that Montanans will hold Mr Gianforte accountable,” Quist said. It was unclear if Gianforte’s assault had an impact on the vote. More than a third of the state’s registered voters had already submitted ballots before it happened, state election officials said, and some Gianforte supporters shrugged off the charges or said they did not believe published accounts. “I feel like, it’s all just propaganda, you know what I mean, it’s hard for me to believe anything the media tells me,” said Nathaniel Trumper, who cast a vote for Gianforte at a polling station in Helena. The assault occurred as Jacobs tried to ask Gianforte about healthcare, according to an audio tape. Fox News Channel reporter Alicia Acuna, who was preparing to interview Gianforte, said the candidate “grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him to the ground.” Afterward, three state newspapers rescinded their endorsements of Gianforte. Some Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, suggested he apologize. Gianforte specifically addressed his apology to Jacobs. “Last night I made a mistake,” he said, adding: “I’m sorry, Mr Ben Jacobs.” Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called Gianforte’s apology “a good first step toward redemption” and said she hoped he “continues to work toward righting his wrong.” Gianforte will take the House seat vacated when Trump named Ryan Zinke as secretary of the interior. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence recorded robocalls to voters on Gianforte’s behalf, and Republican groups poured millions into ads criticizing Quist for property tax liens and unpaid debts, which Quist said stemmed from a botched gallbladder surgery. Quist, who raised more than $6 million for his upstart bid, said the experience gave him insight into the economic struggles some people face. He campaigned last weekend with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who won the state’s 2016 Democratic presidential primary against Hillary Clinton. Gianforte could face additional, more serious charges once prosecutors review the evidence, Gallatin County Attorney Marty Lambert told Reuters. Gianforte has two weeks to enter a plea to the misdemeanor citation issued by the Gallatin County Sheriff’s Office, according to Lambert, who said he would likely review the case before then to decide whether it should be treated as a felony offense, which would supersede the current charge. “There’s always the possibility that when we get the case and the details, that we might look differently at the charging decision,” Lambert said.

 Conservatives ADMIT They Incited Violence At Berkeley; Here’s Proof (SCREENSHOTS),"Of course, when there s violence in protests, we hear a lot of blame getting thrown around. However, the loudest cries of injustice always seem to come from those who don t believe injustice happens to anybody but them   the nationalist, racist, white supremacist alt-right. Such is the case today with the violence that erupted at the Berkeley protests. The problem is, the alt-right was all over Twitter working to incite violence against the  antifa,  or anti-fascists, whom they ve branded as terrorists.Ignoring for a moment the fact that these guys wouldn t know what actual terrorism is if it bit them, one particular person on Twitter spent much of the last six weeks telling his fellow alt-righters what to carry to Berkeley and how to set it up. They seem to think that attaching flags to sticks will disguise the fact that they re weapons.Check out what one of the  leaders,  named General Deplorable, posted to Twitter:General Deplorable s diagram up there is about how to ensure those sticks always legal, so they can carry them into  battle,  as well as how to put them together so they re harder for  enemies  to pull away from them  in battle. Here are two other tweets that are incitements to violence as well:And this is General Deplorable s Twitter profile pic and info, which actually contradict each other:Here s the thing: This crowd of miscreants calls their flag poles  based sticks.

In fact, any stick pole, post, or the like that can be used as a bludgeoning tool (along with anything else that can be used as a weapon) are prohibited. To listen to these guys talk on their social media feeds and on their livestreams, though, it s the anti-Trump protesters who started everything, and Berkeley PD is horrifically biased. Yet, look at what they confiscated:Here are some of the prohibited items that have already removed from the park today. https://t.co/3qx3smYwgk pic.twitter.com/A70VCxFYEu  Berkeley Police (@berkeleypolice) April 15, 2017The American flags belonged to the alt-right, and the black flags and red and black flags belong to what look like black bloc anarchists. Lately they ve shown up at protests and rallies specifically to cause violence. They re who every  real American  conservative thinks are the  violent liberals,  but they are a minority fringe group which currently lacks broad support.It s not likely that they ll ever change their minds on that, either.13 people were arrested and of course, General Deplorable and others are decrying the arrests and Berkeley PD for being biased towards the anti-Trump side, because of course.But they didn t go there to hold a peaceful rally.

" Trump Dominates South Carolina, Dooming The Republican Party","Iiiiiitttt ssssssss a wonderful day in the (White) neighborhood. It s a wonderful day in the (White) neighborhood. Won t you be my (White) neighbor?Donald Trump came to South Carolina and summoned the darkness at the heart of conservative politics like the Pied Piper incarnate. No amount of Bible-thumping, gun-toting or terrorist fear-mongering could draw the crowds away. They wanted one thing and one thing only: Someone to tell them that not only was their hate of Those People permissible, it was proper and necessary to  make America great again. With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Trump had won 32 percent of the vote and led his nearest rivals by about 10 percentage points. He was likely to capture all 50 delegates at stake in the state. Mr. Trump s victory here was not as sweeping as the one in New Hampshire, and there were warning signs as he showed weakness among women and younger voters. But he still won among both independents and Republicans, and among self-described evangelical Christians. He also seemed to have built a coalition that will remain with him through adversity: More than half of voters who made their decisions over a month ago picked Mr. Trump, exit polls showed.That is exciting news! Trump simply has no chance in the general election where his obnoxious racism would turn off much of the country and his general incompetence would lead many conservative voters to not vote. But more importantly, as I ve said many times, Trump has destroyed the illusion that the right wing cares about religion, morals or fetuses. They care about hating Those People and maintaining white supremacy. It s been their motivation for much of this country s history and that s why Trump is their man.Once Rubio or Cruz drop out of the race, the other might consolidate the remaining voters and pass Trump but there s little reason for either of them to do so. Cruz is in it for himself and Rubio is the pick of the Establishment. Trump, of course, is running on pure ego at this point. If this dynamic continues, all signs point to Trump as the nominee and that s the best news possible for Sanders and Clinton.Featured via AI archives",News,"February 21, 2016",1
Legal action to see whether UK could unilaterally stop Brexit gets go-ahead,"EDINBURGH (Reuters) - A group of anti-Brexit Scottish members of parliament has been given the go-ahead to pursue legal action to establish whether the United Kingdom can unilaterally stop the process of leaving the EU, a Scottish court said on Friday. The Scottish Court of Session has accepted a petition from the cross-party group of seven MPs, excluding British Prime Minister Theresa May s ruling Conservatives, to determine whether Brexit can be stopped if Britain, acting alone, decides to reverse the process. The British government has three weeks to respond to the challenge, before the Edinburgh court - Scotland s supreme civil judicial body - sets a date to hear the case, a spokesman said. The seven MPs from the Labour Party, Scottish National Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Greens, want the Court of Sessions to refer the matter to the European Court of Justice, the EU s highest court, to conclusively rule on the issue.  We know it is possible to stay in the European Union if the other member states allow. But experts believe our parliament can withdraw the (leaving) notification without their permission,  the Scottish MPs said in a statement earlier this week.   But there is only one way to be sure: a court has to decide what Article 50 means.   May formally notified the EU of Britain s intention to leave the EU by triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on March 29, starting a two-year exit process, and has said she will not tolerate any attempt in parliament to block it. Brexit supporters argue that after last year s referendum vote to leave, any attempt to halt the process would be anti-democratic. But opponents say the country should have a right to pass final judgement on any exit deal negotiated, and the Scottish challenge is the latest legal attempt to try to ensure this happens.   Article 50 does not specify whether the exit process can be unilaterally reversed although former British diplomat Lord Kerr who drafted it has said Britain can change its mind at any stage before the final exit date in 2019. The referendum saw 52 percent of voters backing Brexit. The poll shook Britain s structure, as voters in Northern Ireland and Scotland backed remaining in the EU but those in Wales and England opted to leave. However, a recent BMG opinion poll found that 51 percent of Britons would now keep EU membership versus 41 percent who still wanted to leave. ",worldnews,"December 22, 2017 ",0
"BREAKING: Federal Judge STOPS Obamacare Transgender, Abortion Related Protections","O Connor found that the plaintiffs had standing to bring the lawsuit because they  have presented concrete evidence to support their fears that they will be subject to enforcement under the Rule. WASHINGTON   A federal judge in Texas on Saturday issued a nationwide injunction halting enforcement of Obama administration protections for transgender and abortion-related healthcare services just one day before they were due to go into effect. The lawsuit   brought by Texas, a handful of other states, and some religiously affiliated nonprofit medical groups   challenges a regulation implementing the sex nondiscrimination requirement found in the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The Health and Human Services (HHS) regulation  forbids discriminating on the basis of  gender identity  and  termination of pregnancy  under Obamacare, as US District Court Judge Reed O Connor wrote in his opinion halting enforcement of those provisions in the rule.Specifically, the ACA provision   Section 1557   prohibits discrimination in federally-funded health benefits, including based on sex. Over the course of 2015 and this year, HHS proposed and finalized a regulation interpreting the definition of  sex  in that provisions to include  gender identity    defined as  internal sense of gender, which may be male, female, neither, or a combination of male and female    as well as  sex stereotyping  and  termination of pregnancy. Explaining the lawsuit, O Connor wrote,  Plaintiffs claim the Rule s interpretation of sex discrimination pressures doctors to deliver healthcare in a manner that violates their religious freedom and thwarts their independent medical judgment and will require burdensome changes to their health insurance plans on January 1, 2017.  The states and nonprofits in the healthcare lawsuit allege that the regulation violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)   which sets the rules for federal government rule-making   and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). O Connor found that the plaintiffs had standing to bring the lawsuit because they  have presented concrete evidence to support their fears that they will be subject to enforcement under the Rule.  The White House defended the administration s policies on Saturday night.Read more: Buzzfeed",Government News,"Dec 31, 2016",1

In the United States for what will be Trump’s first meeting with a foreign leader since he took office last week, May signaled a shift in foreign policy, bringing her position more in line with that of Trump.

Because when others step up as we step back, it is bad for America, for Britain and the world,” May told members of Republican Party at their retreat in a speech often punctuated by applause from an enthusiastic crowd. “This cannot mean a return to the failed policies of the past. The days of Britain and America intervening in sovereign countries in an attempt to remake the world in our own image are over. But nor can we afford to stand idly by.” Her break with the interventionism that launched wars in Iraq and Afghanistan underscores a change in global politics.     It also fits with Trump’s move to put “America first” and scores well with voters in Britain whose feeling of being left behind by globalization helped fuel Britain’s vote to leave the EU last year that propelled May to power. Aware that Brexit will shape her legacy, May welcomed her early visit to the United States, a boost to her attempts to show that Britain can prosper outside the European Union despite criticism at home for cozying up to Trump. On her U.S.-bound flight, May concentrated on similarities with the U.S. leader, who some reporters suggested had a style in stark contrast to her more cautious, restrained approach. “Haven’t you ever noticed ... sometimes opposites attract?” she answered with a laugh. Eager to win favor — and a trade deal — with the new U.S. president to bolster her hand in the divorce talks with the European Union, May said both countries shared many values and that, contrary to his statements that NATO was “obsolete,” Trump had told her he was committed to the U.S.-led military alliance. May said she supported Trump’s “reform agenda” to make NATO and the United Nations “more relevant and purposeful than they are today,” and “many of the priorities your government has laid out for America’s engagement with the world.”  But there may be sticking points in Friday’s talks - May said she condemned the use of torture and would stick to UK policy, suggesting Britain may not accept intelligence that could have come from such methods that Trump could reintroduce. “We condemn torture and my view on that won’t change – whether I’m talking to you or talking to the president,” she said when asked what impact it would have if Trump brought back a CIA program for holding terrorism suspects in secret prisons. May will have navigate the middle ground carefully, wary of being criticized as too pro-Trump or alternatively as too negative toward a future trading partner.  She has threatened to walk away from the EU if she fails to get a good deal, and some critics say that could give other countries, like the United States, the upper hand in any talks.  And the EU might not take kindly to any overly friendly overtures to a president some of the bloc’s main leaders have voiced concern about. Some kind of trade agreement, though, is high on her list of priorities, despite Britain and the United States being at odds over genetically modified organisms, meat production and public procurement and May unable to sign deals until after Brexit. May says she will launch the divorce talks by the end of March by triggering Article 50 of the EU’s Lisbon Treaty, which gives up to two years to negotiate an exit deal. Only then can she agree with third countries. Both leaders should use the time to find areas where they could remove trade barriers, May said. “We’re both very clear that we want a trade deal.” ",politicsNews,"January 26, 2017 ",0

"Russia says close to Syria deal with Turkey, Iran","ASTANA (Reuters) - Russia, Turkey and Iran are close to finalizing an agreement on creating four de-escalation zones in Syria, a senior Russian negotiator said on Thursday. The three sides are discussing details of the agreement at meetings in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, Alexander Lavrentyev, who leads the Russian delegation, told reporters.  Our main task at this international meeting on Syria is to finalize and establish four de-escalation zones,  Lavrentyev said.  We are very close to reaching an agreement on creating these four zones.  The meetings, which also involve representatives of the Damascus government and some rebel factions, will continue on Friday. Lavrentyev said the agreement was likely to include provisions on the deployment of monitors - such as military police servicemen - in the four zones and, more specifically, on their borders. The previous round of Syrian peace talks in Astana in July ended with no agreement after Turkey raised objections. Russia and Iran, which back Syrian President Bashar al-Assad s government, and Turkey, which supports some of the rebels, have been holding talks in Kazakhstan since January and the meeting this week is their sixth.

U.N. asks urgent reforms to end arbitrary detention in Sri Lanka,"COLOMBO (Reuters) - The United Nations on Friday urged the Sri Lankan government to urgently implement reforms to end war-time arbitrary detention and strengthen independent monitoring of tough legislation. Sri Lanka has used the 1979 Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to pursue a tough line to prevent aiding and abetting terrorism in the island nation s long conflict with Tamil Tiger rebels. That legislation gives wide powers to police to arrest a suspect without informing the immediate family, restricts access to lawyers and allows detention of up to 18-months without charging. The war ended in 2009, but the government has not repealed PTA, though it had promised to end arbitrary detentions. Many ethnic minority Tamils who have been arrested under the PTA have complained of years of detention without being charged. The U.N. is now asking Sri Lanka to repeal the draconian law and introduce an internationally acceptable law. The government says it has begun moves to replace the PTA and is in the process of introducing new legislation.   There are no effective safeguards against arbitrariness in this context and there is an urgent need to strengthen mechanisms for independent monitoring and oversight, Leigh Toomey, a member of the UN working group on arbitrary detention told reporters in Colombo after concluding a 11-day mission. She said they had identified significant challenges to the right of personal liberty in Sri Lanka, resulting in arbitrary detention across the country. The Working Group also said their attention had been drawn to a loss of liberty among the socially vulnerable, such as children, women, elderly people, people with psycho-social problems and the poor. Sri Lanka is under criticism from the rights groups over its slow progress on the commitments it made to the UN human Rights council following a U.N. resolution that called for post-war reconciliation and an investigation of all alleged war crimes. Sri Lanka ended a 26-year-civil war crushing the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelan in 2009. The United Nations and rights groups have accused the military of killing thousands of civilians, mostly Tamils, during the final weeks of the conflict. The Tamil Tigers were also accused of widespread abuses during the war, such as using child soldiers and targeting civilians with suicide bombers. In November European lawmakers said they were disappointed about Sri Lanka s slow roll-out of human rights reforms that it had promised in exchange for trade concessions.   A U.N. rights watchdog in 2016 called on Sri Lanka to investigate documented allegations of torture and rape of detainees by security forces and to rein in broad police powers. The U.N. Committee against Torture described continuing reports of abductions, deaths in custody, poor conditions of detention and the use of forced confessions in court. ",worldnews,"December 15, 2017 ",0
UNREAL! Michelle Obama Gets $70 Million For Program To Empower Girls BUT Not American Girls,"Unreal! Mooch gets millions for Pakistani girls? The American taxpayers should be outraged by this! Let Pakistan empower its own people! Michelle Obama has been traveling all over the world with the Let Girls Learn initiative as her pet project. The only thing is that most of the places she s traveled to have a great track record with educating girls. It s just one big around the world vacation for Mooch compliments of the American taxpayer. Judicial Watch s Tom Fitton had this to say about the trip: The Obama family continues to bill the taxpayers for costly tourism jaunts thinly disguised as humanitarian crusades EUROPEAN VACATION: MOOCH RUNS UP A HUGE TAB COMPLIMENTS OF THE TAXPAYERS Could someone please remind this woman that America is BROKE! As public schools around the United States suffer through a perpetual financial crisis, the Obama administration commits a breathtaking $70 million to help educate girls in a terrorist nation known as Al Qaeda headquarters. It s part of the First Lady s initiative (Let Girls Learn) to educate and empower an estimated 62 million girls in third-world countries who are not in school. A noble cause indeed, but it s costing American taxpayers huge sums while kids especially minorities in this country struggle in schools that aren t adequately funded, according to public education advocates.  We know that countries with more girls in secondary school tend to have lower maternal mortality rates, lower infant mortality rates, lower rates of HIV/AIDS, and better child nutrition,  according to the initiative s website.  But too often, a girl who could change her world for the better is locked out of that future by the circumstances of her birth or the customs of her community.  So it s Uncle Sam to the rescue. The government of Pakistan, which is included in the State Department s Country Reports on Terrorism, will get the $70 million to promote education among 200,000 girls and young women age 10-19. The announcement was initially made during a White House event this month with the wife and daughter of Pakistan s Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif. The program will serve as a platform and catalyst for broader political and social commitment to strengthen girls  education and empowerment in Pakistan, according to a government announcement.  Young women in Pakistan face barriers and lack of access to education opportunities from an early age due to poverty, cultural norms, and geographic isolation,  the announcement states. The question remains; should American tax dollars go to this foreign education cause when public schools in this country have been hurting for years? Besides financial troubles, there s an epidemic of low-performing schools and dismal graduation rates around the country, especially in the nation s inner cities. They could probably use a few million to create programs that might help improve academic performance or perhaps empower needy students like the multi-million-dollar allocation is predicted to help empower girls in Pakistan. The public school district in the Obamas  own hometown of Chicago could use some extra cash. By Thanksgiving as many as 5,000 teachers could be laid off unless the 367,499-student district Chicago Public Schools gets a $500 million bailout from the state. A recent editorial in the area s mainstream newspaper says that it  has been a disastrous time for Chicago Public Schools.  The piece is accompanied by an illustration of a yellow school bus with  Corruption & Politics in our Schools  plastered across the side. Districts across the nation are in similar situations. In Detroit, Michigan the public school system has a $515 million debt and among the nation s worst performing students. Read more: Judicial Watch",politics,"Oct 28, 2015",1

HEY RACHEL MADDOW…While You’re On The Subject Of Taxes…What About Tax Evading Hosts At MSNBC?,"So Rachel, now that we re on the subject of taxes President Trump PAID, how about we remind Americans about the tax evaders/MSNBC hosts employed by your leftist network:MSNBC host and perpetual race agitator Al Sharpton certainly gets around quite a bit. Any time there s any sort of Black Lives Matter protest or urban unrest with a race relations twist, Sharpton seems to appear within hours as if by magic. So busy is the man s schedule that he apparently still can t find time to sit down with an accountant and clear up more than a half million dollars in unpaid taxes which the IRS has been pestering him about for some time now. In a follow-up to their previous reports on the subject, the Daily Caller finds that both Sharpton and his MSNBC colleague Joy-Ann Reid are still on the Tax Man s naughty list, despite assurances last year that they were working to settle up their accounts.Watch Jesse Waters confront Al Sharpton and ask him about his unpaid taxes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9YI5-c1udYMSNBC national correspondent Joy-Ann Reid has yet to pay off her still open nearly $5,000 tax warrant that attracted a good bit of attention last year. Ditto for the nearly $600,000 for two tax warrants that New York lists for MSNBC host Rev. Al Sharpton.In April 2016, New York filed a $4,948.15 tax warrant against Joy-Ann Reid, who serves as managing editor of theGrio.com and until earlier this year hosted MSNBC s The Reid Report, and her husband, Jason. Reid has called taxes on the wealthy  a basic fairness argument,  also arguing for  smart spending and smart tax increases  to create economic growth.   Daily CallerMeanwhile, Sharpton, whose state and federal delinquencies are the stuff of legend, has, according to records accessed Monday evening at least two open New York tax warrants for nearly $600,00. One judgment, dated May 19, 2009, is for $103,156.06. The other, from December 16, 2008, is for $492,612.41.Sharpton insisted to the New York Post and New York Times in 2014 that he was paying down his debts. The Times article noted that his insistence conflicted with  information provided by state officials.

Saudi banks freeze accounts of suspects detained in probe: sources,"RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian banks have begun freezing the accounts of suspects ensnared in an anti-corruption probe, banking and business sources told Reuters on Monday. Dozens of people including royals, ministers and businessmen have been detained in an investigation by a new anti-corruption body headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The central bank ordered banks to freeze the accounts of people under investigation in the probe, the sources said, declining to be named because he was not authorized to talk to media. Two of the sources said the number of accounts affected could run into the hundreds, but none of the sources mentioned the names of those affected.  The freezing of accounts has already happened,  said another source.  The freezing is a precautionary measure that will end as soon as the suspects are either charged or pronounced innocent.  A central bank spokesman was not immediately available to comment. Eleven princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers are among those arrested, including billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, Saudi Arabia s best-known international investor, according to Saudi officials. The allegations against the men include money laundering, bribery, extorting officials and taking advantage of public office for personal gain, a Saudi official said. The new anti-corruption committee has the power to seize assets at home and abroad before the results of its investigations are known.  ",worldnews,"November 6, 2017 ",0
U.S. firms invited to bid for Saudi nuclear plants,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has invited U.S. firms to take part in developing its civilian nuclear power program, Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Monday, adding the kingdom was not interested in diverting nuclear technology to military use. Reuters has reported that Westinghouse is in talks with other U.S.-based companies to form a consortium for a multi-billion-dollar project to build two reactors and that those firms are pushing Washington to restart talks with Riyadh on a civil nuclear cooperation pact. Falih said Saudi Arabia was committed to restricting nuclear technology to civilian use.  Not only are we not interested in any way to diverting nuclear technology to military use, we are very active in non-proliferation by others,  he said at a joint news conference with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry. KACARE, the King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy, is the Saudi government agency tasked with the nuclear plans. It said last month on its website that it was in talks with Toshiba-owned Westinghouse and France s EDF.   We hope that the two paths will converge - the commercial, technical discussions between KACARE and the American companies, while we work with our counterparts on the American side to address the regulatory and policy issues,  Falih said. Perry, who is on his first official visit to Saudi Arabia and will go on to the United Arab Emirates and Qatar this week, said it was  a bit premature  to comment on the negotiations.  We are in the early stages of it but I think we both are working from the position of getting to yes,  he said. Washington usually requires a country to sign a peaceful nuclear cooperation pact - known as a 123 agreement - that blocks steps in fuel production with potential bomb-making uses. In previous talks, Saudi Arabia has refused to sign up to any agreement that would deprive it of the possibility of one day enriching uranium. The world s top oil exporter says it wants nuclear power to diversify its energy mix allowing it to export more crude rather than burning it to generate electricity. It has not yet acquired nuclear power or enrichment technology. Reactors need uranium enriched to around 5 percent purity but the same technology in this process can also be used to enrich the heavy metal to a higher, weapons-grade level. This has been at the heart of Western and regional concerns over the nuclear work of Iran, Saudi Arabia s arch-rival which enriches uranium domestically. Riyadh has said it wants to tap its own uranium resources for  self-sufficiency in producing nuclear fuel . The kingdom sent a request for information to nuclear reactor suppliers in October, and plans to award the first construction contract in 2018. Its nuclear plans have gained momentum as part of a reform plan led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to reduce the economy s dependence on oil. Riyadh wants eventually to install up to 17.6 gigawatts of atomic capacity by 2032 - or up to 17 reactors. This is a promising prospect for the struggling global nuclear industry and the United States is expected to face competition from South Korea, Russia, France and China for the initial tender.

WHY OBAMA’S LAWSUIT AGAINST NC Is Really About The Jack-Boot Of Government On America’s Throats,"Obama is clearly attempting to strip Americans of our right to express our opinions on social issues based on our religion or morals. Americans have found themselves in a scary place, where we are remaining silent when we know we should be speaking out, because we re afraid of being shamed by the progressive Left. Meanwhile the Left continues to blur the lines of morality, hoping that they will erase all individual thought and speech.In a communist society, the individual s best interests are indistinguishable from the society s best interest. Thus, the idea of an individual freedom is incompatible with a communist ideology. The only reason to hold individual speech and information rights would be to better the society. Some of us care little about the debate over public bathrooms. We do, however, care about the ongoing destruction of federalism, individual choice, and good-faith debate.One reliable way to quash dissent and force moral codes on others is to liken your cause to that of the civil rights fight. Every liberal issue is situated somewhere on the great historical arc of  equality  and  justice.  If a person stands against even one of these causes which were once great but are increasingly trivial they have, according to the cultural imperialists of the Obama administration, aligned themselves with the Klan. Literally.After U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Department of Justice had filed a federal lawsuit to stop North Carolina from passing a  controversial law this is the go-to characterization of conservative bills that pass with healthy majorities requiring transgender people to use public bathrooms matching their birth certificate, she had this to say:This is not the first time that we have seen discriminatory responses to historic moments of progress for our nation. We saw it in the Jim Crow laws that followed the Emancipation Proclamation; we saw it in the fierce and widespread resistance to Brown v. Board of Education; and we saw it in the proliferation of state bans on same-sex unions that were intended to stifle any hope that gay and lesbian Americans might one day be afforded the right to marry.Likening a spat over biologically segregated boy/girl bathrooms to the genuine, violent, systematic, state-sponsored, society-wide bigotry that took place in this country for a century is both intellectually and morally corrupt. It s not all a continuum. Yet this administration peddles these kinds of risible comparisons in the cause of self-aggrandizement all the time. Hans Fiene has coined it Selma envy.The present situation is significantly different, and in every possible sense less dire. It is the sort of social problem generally worked out amongst people in this country without unelected civil rights commissions punishing business owners for thought crimes. Under North Carolina s law no one was stopping a private company or coffee shop or big box store from having any kind of bathroom set-up they desire. I m pretty sure most voters don t comprehend this fact when they hear the distorted coverage of these laws in the news.North Carolina and other states have preemptively moved forward with these kinds to bills to head off the state redefining gender. Too late. The fact is that the federal government can simply announce that a man can be a woman and vice versa if they choose. It then compels everyone in country to accept this reality. Yet there is no government definition of what transgendered means, other self-identification, which can mean anything.  Civil Rights  Division Chief Vanita Gupta says:  Transgender men are men.   Transgender women are women.  So sayeth Vanita Gupta, so sayeth we all. Or else. And now 300 million people have adhere to the Obama administration s relativistic notions about nature and gender.Now, from what I can gather the central anxiety of many people is not that the transgendered will take advantage of their children, but that any man can simply declare himself a woman, put on a wig, and go into a public bathroom. Maybe it s an irrational fear, maybe it s not. As a father who s had to send young daughters into busy public bathrooms, I know one thing for sure: I could not care less what Vanita Gupta has to say on the topic.In a broader sense, the suit is symbolic of the federal government s eight-year crusade to decimate any semblance of federalism and streamline progressive morality. The administration ignores state laws that conflict with federal policy when it approves and it sues states when it does not. States that pass law enforcement bills President Obama finds unsatisfactory will see the full force of the Justice Department come down on them. Those with drug legalization laws and immigration laws he does like, even if they conflict with federal law, have nothing to worry about. Whether one agrees in theory with these moves and I am liberal on drug legalization and immigration allowing Washington to selectively enforce law conflicts with the kind of republicanism that allows us to be diverse and deal with unique problems locally.For entire story: The Federalist",politics,"May 11, 2016",1

Merkel wants outline coalition deal with SPD by mid-January,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday she wanted to conclude exploratory talks on a possible coalition with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) by mid-January to end Germany s political deadlock. Merkel was asked if comments by her and President Emmanuel Macron that Germany and France hope to make progress on ideas to reform the euro zone by March were realistic, given the risk that talks with the SPD could falter.  I mentioned March because we want to hold exploratory talks by mid-January,  Merkel told reporters after a meeting of the executive board of her Christian Democrats (CDU). Merkel s conservative bloc, weakened in a September election that produced a splintered parliament, will hold their first meeting with the SPD on Wednesday. A deal with the SPD is Merkel s best chance of securing a fourth term as chancellor. She implied there was room for maneuver on policy, but appeared to rule out cooperation outside the framework of a formal coalition. If the exploratory talks are successful, the SPD will move on to negotiate a detailed blueprint with the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, setting out government policy for the next four years.  The SPD agreed to enter talks only reluctantly after voters rewarded it in September for the last four years of  grand coalition  under Merkel by handing it its worst result since 1933. Some in the SPD now want to cooperate with Merkel outside of a formal coalition agreement, in the hope of better preserving a more distinct separate identity in voters  minds. But Merkel said a stable government required formal agreements on policy:  Anything short of that would mean the exploratory talks were not successful.  Should Merkel and SPD leader Martin Schulz fail to reach an agreement, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier could call a new election, something neither party wants as both fear the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) would make more gains. SPD General Secretary Lars Klingbeil warned Merkel on Monday that party leaders would not win the required blessing from members for renewing their alliance if the SPD gave way on key election promises. He said it would insist on distinctive leftist policies, such as introducing a single  citizen s insurance  to replace the current dual system: superior private health insurance used mainly by the wealthy, and a more widely accessible public health insurance. Conservatives say switching to a unified system would erode competition and worsen services. But Merkel said on Monday that it was possible to find common ground with the SPD on ways to improve the healthcare system. Immigration is another sticking point. The SPD opposes a conservative plan to prolong a halt to the right of some accepted asylum seekers to bring in family members. It says the measure hampers efforts to integrate the 1.6 million people who entered Germany seeking asylum in 2015 and 2016.  Integration works only with families,  Klingbeil said. The CSU, which fears losses to the AfD in an election in Bavaria next year, is likely to put up more resistance to SPD policy demands than the CDU, notably on immigration.

 WATCH: Mike Pence’s Neighbors Troll Him With Gay Pride Flags On His Block In D.C.,"The bigoted vice-president-elect is being trolled by his new neighbors at his temporary residence. Rainbow flags are popping up on different houses on Gov. Mike Pence s block where he is renting a home before moving into the Vice-President s mansion, according to WJLA.One neighbor, Ilse Heintzen, has gay and lesbian friends and wanted to send a respectful message to Pence. A respectful message showing, in my case, my disagreement with some of his thinking,  said Heintzen. One neighbor suggested the idea so she and others ordered their own flags.Other neighbors, too, started hanging the pride flags in front of their homes after the VP-Elect moved in because of Pence s stance on the gay community. More residents are said to be joining the silent protest. I have no idea what [the Vice-President Elect] will think about, but I hope he will change his mind,  she said.As of now, there are about six gay pride flags adorning the block and more are on the way. This is one way that I can show my disagreement,  Heintzen added.Last year, the Indiana Governor signed a religious freedom law that could worsen discrimination against LGBTQ people. There was a backlash from business community, so Pence eventually signed an amendment to the law intended to protect gays and lesbians.Pence supported a constitutional amendment in 2006 that would have defined marriage as only between a man and a woman. In a speech, Pence said,  societal collapse was always brought about following an advent of the deterioration of marriage and family.  In addition, Pence said being gay a choice and believes keeping gays and lesbians from marrying was not a form of discrimination, but that it s  God s idea. Pence even opposed a law that would prohibit discrimination against LGBT people in the workplace but Donald Trump claims his administration will represent all Americans.So, that s only a few examples out of many as to why Pence was addressed by a concerned cast member of the musical Hamilton.Photo by Andrew Gombert via Getty.",News,"December 1, 2016",1
Bolivia's Morales leads 'Che' homage 50 years after execution,"VALLEGRANDE, Bolivia (Reuters) - Thousands gathered on Monday in a small town in southern Bolivia, where the leader of the Cuban revolution Ernesto  Che  Guevara was executed by CIA-backed Bolivian soldiers 50 years earlier.  Bolivia s President Evo Morales, one of few remaining leftist leaders in a region that has shifted to the political right, camped in a sleeping bag and tent and welcomed dignitaries from allies Cuba and Venezuela.  50 years later, the legend of Ernesto Che Guevara lives in the young people, in their unquestionable struggle for equality and liberation,  Morales wrote on Twitter ahead of a scheduled speech. Over the weekend artists, activists, veterans of the Cuban revolution and Guevara s descendants gathered to commemorate the revolutionary hero in Vallegrande, where he was buried in a hidden, unmarked grave in 1967 before his remains were moved to Cuba 30 years later. The Argentine-born doctor met Fidel Castro in Mexico, where they trained and bought guns in preparation for the Cuban revolution before setting sail for the island on Nov. 25, 1956, to start the insurgency that toppled U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista two years later. Guevara rose to become one of the most important men in the rebel force and later in Cuba s revolutionary government, heading the central bank and industry ministry.  He had hoped to replicate the revolution in Congo and then in Bolivia, but his call to arms largely failed and he was surrounded by U.S.-trained soldiers and caught in a ravine near La Higuera on Oct. 8, 1967. The next day he was taken to Vallegrande, 60 km (37 miles) away and Bolivia s then-President Ren  Barrientos ordered his execution, avoiding a trial. Guevara was 39.  His remains were exhumed and reburied in Santa Clara, Cuba, in 1997, when the Cuban Communism he helped build was struggling  to survive after the Soviet Union collapsed. Commemorative ceremonies were held in Santa Clara on Sunday, and Cuba s Vice President Ramiro Vald s joined Morales in Bolivia on Monday.

"LEFTIST Resentment Peddler, Larry David (Net Worth $800 Million) Claims $5K Prize For Calling Trump A “Racist”","And why wouldn t he? The leftist comedy writer/actor with a net worth of $800 million, probably needs the money to feed all of the illegal aliens who live with him. Even though we don t have any proof that he has illegal aliens living with him, we re pretty sure every celebrity who speaks out against those who want to close our borders and deport illegals must be taking some personal responsibility for their welfare Right? Not likely Comedian Larry David is going to be picking up a $5,000 bounty for calling billionaire businessman and GOP presidential contender Donald Trump a  racist  on national TV.Earlier in the week, the DEPLORABLE group DeportRacism.com PAC offered a $5,000 reward to anyone who called Trump a racist on-air during Saturday Night Live.During the show s opening monologue   with Trump flanked by cast members Taran Killiam and Darrell Hammond both made up as Trump   David heckled the blustery businessman from offstage, repeatedly yelling,  You re a racist. Trump s a racist. Asked by Trump why he was doing it, David replied,  I heard if I yelled that, they d give me $5000. Despite being written as part of the opening, DeportRacism is making good on their promise. Via: Raw StoryAccording to a press release issued before the show was broadcast on the west coast, Luke Montgomery, campaign director for DeportRacism, said the PAC was  excited  to award the money to David.Here is a great piece entitled: Larry David Curbs His Enthusiasm:You may know Larry David as the writer and producer from Seinfeld. You may know him from Curb Your Enthusiasm. After his most recent New York Times piece, you ll know him as the guy who curbed his intelligence on liberalism:There is a God! It passed! The Bush tax cuts have been extended two years for the upper bracketeers, of which I am a proud member, thank you very much. I m the last person in the world I d want to be beside, but I am beside myself! This is a life changer, I tell you. A life changer!To begin with, I was planning a trip to Cabo with my kids for Christmas vacation. We were going to fly coach, but now with the money I m saving in taxes, I m going to splurge and bump myself up to first class. First class! Somebody told me they serve warm nuts up there, and call you  mister.  I might not get off the plane!The first rule of Fight Club is you never talk about Fight Club. The first rule for the Wealthy Elitist Liberal Club is you always talk about your money. The second? Find a way to feign indignation that the federal government isn t confiscating more of your earnings, without ever mentioning that there s nothing stopping you from turning it over to Uncle Sam.Larry David s Thanks for the Tax Cuts! is based on the false premise that  the rich  is a homogenous group of artists, namely successful Hollywood actors, writers, and producers who occupy their spare time on liberal guilt trips (wealthy Republicans don t count, as Hollywood liberals classify them as monsters).Larry would rather not think about the countless Subchapter S corporations and small mom and pop businesses that benefit from tax cuts because their success is rooted in creating widgets, gadgets, and services the world finds useful; his came about because he s sharp with sex jokes and awkward situations.Americans  naturally do not begrudge someone for their success because the track record for the United States is stellar when it comes to upward economic mobility. Hard work, patience, sound judgment, and a pleasant demeanor tends to take Americans pretty far, which is why they need to be prompted to believe  the rich  boogeyman is out to get them. Smug, self-loathing Hollywood types like Larry David play the part well:This tax cut just might save my life. Who said Republicans don t support health care? I m going to have the blueberries with my cereal, and I m not talking Special K. Those days are over. It s nothing but real granola from now on. The kind you get in the plastic bins in health food stores. Did someone say  organic ?Everyone already knows Larry has enough disposable income to fill his swimming pool with blueberries, just for a giggle, if he wanted. However, the point of Thanks for the Tax Cuts! was to let readers know that higher tax rates would be a pittance to him and his friends. The point is to rub readers  noses in trips to Cabo and expensive organic foods they can t afford, in order to stoke the flames of class warfare liberalism needs to survive.It s not working, Larry. See the recent election results for more details.Americans are getting wise to resentment peddlers who seek to tax you until the day you die before taxing you and the gifts you sought to pass on to family, one more time as Rigor mortis kicks in. They know that it isn t the successful entrepreneurs and businessmen hurting the future prospects of a great nation, but Washington politicians addicted to kamikaze entitlement spending and private property power grabs.The liberal comedian Wanda Sykes once called Larry David Ass Man. After witnessing him try to sell tax hikes by inducing resentment, I couldn t agree more.Watch Larry David call Donald Trump a  racist  during the Saturday Night Live show that crushed the ratings.  It s likely one of the high points in his career. What Larry David may not be able to comprehend in his narrow little world, is that if it weren t for Donald Trump agreeing to host SNL, no one would have even bothered to watch the dying show. Larry David should be thanking Donald for allowing him to appear on the same stage, instead of walking away from the show smugly pretending he had anything at all to do with the show s astronomical ratings.",left-news,"Nov 8, 2015",1
"WAR HAWK, ANTI-TRUMPER RINOS Join Dems To Investigate Russian Influence In Election…Trump Says Russian Interference Claim Is “Ridiculous”[VIDEO]","Pro man-made climate change, RINO Lindsay Graham, who never saw a war he didn t want to engage our troops in, joins his war hawk, RINO, anti-Trumper friend John McCain (who got crushed by Obama in the 2008 Presidential election), to call for investigations into Russian influence in our November elections. John McCain withdrew his support for Trump after the bad words he used in a private conversation with another guy. Lindsey Graham got crushed by Trump in the primaries and was a loud voice against his nomination. He eventually changed his mind and offered his support for Trump in the general election against Hillary. John McCain did not change his mind.The recount is over, but there s still time to discredit the legitimacy of Donald J. Trump s landslide election. Who better to help the Democrats, than two RINO s who are at the top of the heap when it comes to draining useless Republicans from  the swamp. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham (R) said Wednesday he would lead a charge to investigate Russia s interference in the U.S. election and hacks on the Democratic Party. I think [Donald] Trump should take a real tough tone with Russia, because if he doesn t, you re going to allow Russia to begin to break apart alliances,  Graham told CNN s Manu Raju.The Republican senator also said he hoped to use his leadership role on two subcommittees to launch a deeper investigation of Russia s hacks, CNN reported. Graham chairs the State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs subcommittee and the Crime and Terrorism subcommittee.Raju said Graham told him that he and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chair of the Armed Services Committee, will travel to Eastern Europe to investigate Russian meddling in other countries  elections.During the campaign, Graham was a strong GOP critic of Trump, including on his friendlier stance toward Russia, and chose to vote instead for independent candidate Evan McMullin.  The HillThe Obama administration clearly stated that they saw NO evidence of outside election tampering in the general election.On November 26, 2016 the Obama administration said it has seen no evidence of hackers tampering with the 2016 presidential election, even as recount proceedings began in Wisconsin. We stand behind our election results, which accurately reflect the will of the American people,  a senior administration official told POLITICO late Friday. The federal government did not observe any increased level of malicious cyber activity aimed at disrupting our electoral process on election day,  the official added.  We believe our elections were free and fair from a cybersecurity perspective. Yet yesterday this story appeared in the New York Times: WASHINGTON   American intelligence agencies have concluded with  high confidence  that Russia acted covertly in the latter stages of the presidential campaign to harm Hillary Clinton s chances and promote Donald J. Trump, according to senior administration officials.They based that conclusion, in part, on another finding   which they say was also reached with high confidence   that the Russians hacked the Republican National Committee s computer systems in addition to their attacks on Democratic organizations, but did not release whatever information they gleaned from the Republican networks.In the months before the election, it was largely documents from Democratic Party systems that were leaked to the public. Intelligence agencies have concluded that the Russians gave the Democrats  documents to WikiLeaks.Republicans have a different explanation for why no documents from their networks were ever released. Over the past several months, officials from the Republican committee have consistently said that their networks were not compromised, asserting that only the accounts of individual Republicans were attacked. On Friday, a senior committee official said he had no comment.Donald Trump has said the CIA s conclusion that Russia interfered in the presidential election is  ridiculous  and being used by Democrats as  just another excuse  for his defeat of Hillary Clinton.The president-elect told Fox News Sunday that he did not necessarily oppose Barack Obama s order for a review of campaign-season cyber-attacks.But he added that in any such effort,  you should not just say  Russia . You should say other countries also, and maybe other individuals.   Guardian",politics,"Dec 11, 2016",1
 Bill Clinton HUMILIATES Trump During Surprise Q&A In A Bookstore,"Bill Clinton finally spoke up about Donald Trump, and Trump is not going to like what he said.The former president has been quiet since Election Day, but a journalist bumped into him at a local bookstore and got the scoop of a lifetime as Clinton fielded questions from some customers who noticed him.As we all know, the CIA and 17 intelligence agencies and the FBI have all concluded that Russia interfered with our political process to help Trump win. But Trump and his team continue to defend Russia and insist that we should all ignore the facts and move on as if a cyber attack against our country by a foreign state isn t important.Well, Bill Clinton was asked about Trump s reaction to the assessment and he replied by questioning Trump intelligence. You would need to have a single-digit IQ not to recognize what was going on,  Clinton said.When asked if Trump is smart, Clinton said,  He doesn t know much. One thing he does know is how to get angry, white men to vote for him. Let s keep in mind that Bill Clinton and Trump know each other, so when Bill Clinton says that Trump  doesn t know much  he knows what he s talking about.Rather than run a campaign based on policy and facts, Trump ran a campaign designed to divide the American people along racial lines. Trump used hate and fear to the point where his supporters didn t care about his lack of knowledge about the issues.Clinton even took a shot at Trump for calling his win a landslide, despite losing the popular vote by nearly 3 millions votes and capturing less electoral votes than most presidents in the last 100 years, including President Obama s victories in 2008 and 2012, and Bill Clinton s in 1992. Landslide? I got something like 370 electoral votes,  Clinton quipped.  That was a landslide. In the end, Clinton told the people around him to remain vigilant and alert because we are entering a  post-truth era where facts don t matter. Here are images of the editorial as it appeared in the Bedford Pound Ridge Record Review.And now we wait for the temper tantrum that Trump is likely to throw on Twitter.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"December 19, 2016",1

But will Bill O Reilly s own website be enough for his gigantic ego? Will it be enough for the fans who are used to turning on the TV and don t want to go to their computer or phone to watch him?Bill has built the largest conservative audience on TV. Many of his loyal fans are convinced the Murdoch brothers have used these allegations against him as an excuse to remove him from their network as they work to bring the FOX News channel more to the center and away from its right-leaning roots.O Reilly was dismissed overnight following allegations of sexual harassment by at least six women. It has been reported that Lachlan s wife Sarah Murdoch helped influence the decision. Last year the former Fox News creator, Roger Ailes, was sacked in similar circumstances, going on to advise Donald Trump s presidential campaign.It has also been suggested by many social media users that Roger Ailes and Bill O Reilly might form their own conservative leaning news network to compete against FOX News.In any case, for those who are missing the voice of a man they ve listened to for over 20 years Here you go.Bill O Reilly s first podcast started out like this (audio is below):Hey, I missed you guys.Welcome to the No Spin News on BillOReilly.com, a completely different experience than what you ve had in the past.

HOW HILLARY DESTROYED This Man’s Life To Hide Her Incompetence In #Benghazi,"Does anyone even care that this American man was picked out of thin air to be used as a scape goat to cover for Hillary s incompetence? One day he s an innocent man making third rate videos and posting them on Youtube, and the next day, he s being hauled off to jail for a video he produced that Hillary and her lying staff claimed inspired a terror attack in Benghazi! This could have been any American. Of all the evil things Hillary has done, this has to rank at the top, just below the four dead Americans who she left unprotected to die in Benghazi. Yet, the Benghazi Butcher rolls on without missing a beat, as the mainstream media cheers her on like she s the horse they re betting on at the Kentucky Derby In September 2012 Hillary blamed an  awful internet video  for the deaths of four American heroes in Benghazi.Hillary Clinton made the statements as the bodies of the four dead Americans were brought back to US soil.She made the public comments just three days after the assault on the compound that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty.But thanks to leaked Wikileaks emails we now know that Hillary Clinton wrote Chelsea during the Benghazi attacks telling her Americans were killed by an al-Qaeda like group.Hillary later lied and blamed the attack on a YouTube video. And the director of the YouTube video was later arrested.Nakoula Basseley Nakoula (C) is escorted out of his home by Los Angeles County Sheriff s officers in Cerritos, California September 15, 2012 (Reuters / Bret Hartman)Four years after the deadly Benghazi terrorist attack Hillary Clinton is running for president and Nakoula Basseley Nakoula is broke, destitute and living in a homeless shelter.And ISIS is in control of much of Libya.FOX News reported:Four Americans died in the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi, and those who survived saw their stories of heroism told in a Hollywood movie, but the filmmaker whose work was wrongly blamed for touching off the event lives in obscurity, poverty and fear, FoxNews.com has learned.Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, the Coptic Christian whose short video  The Innocence of Muslims  was initially faulted for sparking the Sept. 11, 2012 terror attack at U.S. diplomatic compounds in Libya, is now living in a homeless shelter run by First Southern Baptist Church in Buena Park, Calif. He has served time in prison, been shamed publicly by the White House and threatened with death.

" BREAKING: Melania Trump’s Immigration Records Made Public, Show Trump’s ULTIMATE Hypocrisy","GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has taken a ridiculously hardline   and even bigoted   stance on immigration. He has promised to build a wall and force Mexico to pay for it, and he has said that he will erect  deportation forces  to root out and get rid of all people in the United States without proper documentation. Well, as we already knew, it turns out that The Donald is the ultimate hypocrite on this one.According to the Associated Press, it turns out that Donald Trump s wife Melania violated immigration laws by working illegally in the United States when she first arrived from her native Slovenia. Melania often modeled using just her first name, and was first granted entry into the country on a visitor s visa, known as a B1/B2 visa. This occurred on August 27, 1996. Melania did not get a legal work visa until October 18, 1996. During the time when she was prohibited from working in the country, Melania made money on ten different modeling assignments, totaling upwards of $20,000. She got a green card in 2000, and became a naturalized citizen in 2006.So, in other words, Melania Trump lied about her immigration story, as recently as Thursday, when she once again touted how a million percent legal immigration is the only way to go, and that this is how she did it. Melania said, in part, in her stump speech: As a young entrepreneur, I wanted to follow my dream to a place where freedom and opportunity were in abundance. So of course, I came here. Living and working in America was a true blessing, but I wanted something more. I wanted to be an American. Well, it appears that, as has long been suspected, that Melania Trump wasn t as kosher in her immigration and work practices as she claims. The information obtained by the AP include, but are not limited to, her contract from Metropolitan International Management   a modeling agency. Also, there s the ledgers from the agency, which is no longer in business, that shows Melania working during the time when she had the visitor s visa, but no work visa. It seems to be a complicated story full of many attempts to cover up Melania s wrongdoing, but it is certainly quite interesting. This would be why Melania Trump never released actual records regarding her initial immigration to the United States and her eventual path to citizenship. While it is unlikely that her citizenship is at risk, it certainly means that she committed immigration fraud. You can read more here at the Associated Press.The long and short of it is this: Donald Trump launched his crazy bid for the presidency preying on the fears of the  other.  Namely, immigrants. That is the height of hypocrisy, seeing as how his own wife didn t completely comply with immigration law. Hopefully this story, and the many other lies and cover-ups and shady dealings surrounding the Trump campaign break through the hypnotism that the demagogue has spun onto so many desperate citizens of this great country, and they figure out that they are falling for the biggest con of all time.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"November 4, 2016",1
 Comey Drops BOMBSHELL On Sessions: I Don’t Want To Be Alone With Trump (VIDEO),"The entire nation is now waiting with bated breath for fired FBI Director James Comey to testify in open session Congress in what might be the biggest political event since election night. That will not take place until Thursday, and in the meantime, bombshells keep dropping from the White House   especially on the subject of just how troubled Comey was by Trump s behavior. In fact, it seems that Comey was so uneasy that he actually told Attorney General Jeff Sessions not to leave him alone with Trump.The New York Times is reporting that Trump s inappropriate requests for Comey and the FBI to drop certain elements of the Russian hacking investigations made him uncomfortable enough that he went to Sessions and told him that he and his agency needed him to be a firewall of protection from investigation meddling from the West Wing of the White House. Comey, however, never told Sessions specific details of just what had him so worried when it came to Trump; after all, Sessions and Trump are notoriously close, and it is not a certainty that Sessions is completely trustworthy in these matters, either.When asked about these conversations with the now-former FBI Director, the Department of Justice only said: The attorney general doesn t believe it s appropriate to respond to media inquiries on matters that may be related to ongoing investigations. So, in other words, there s no denial here that these conversations took place. This is quite a development, considering that the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation was so deeply concerned about the behavior of the nation s chief executive that he simply could not bring himself to be alone in a room with him.Trump s problematic behavior causes Obama Justice Department Official Matthew S. Axelrod to weigh in. He said: You have the president of the United States talking to the director of the F.B.I., not just about any criminal investigation, but one involving his presidential campaign. That is such a sharp departure from all the past traditions and rules of the road. Indeed, if this behavior is not illegal, it is, at the very least, wildly inappropriate and unethical. Thursday should be a goldmine of new revelations from Comey. Hopefully, said revelations get us at least a step or two closer to being rid of this Trumpster fire of an  administration.

Kenya opposition leader calls for calm in slum hit by deadly violence,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga called for calm on Sunday as he visited a slum in the capital that was hit by violence when a political stand-off over a repeat presidential election fed into rising ethnic tensions. Clashes in Kawangware and in a village in western Kenya following Thursday s vote were the first signs that face-offs between Odinga supporters and the police might eventually morph into neighbors turning against each other.  A country cannot be ruled by the gun. Standing here in this church we want to condemn the militarization of politics in this country,  Odinga told residents in the Nairobi slum. The veteran opposition leader had boycotted the re-run of an August presidential election that was nullified by Kenya s Supreme Court on procedural grounds, leaving President Uhuru Kenyatta with an almost free run against six minor candidates. On Friday, a day after the repeat vote was held in most of the country, ethnic violence in Kawangware saw dozens of homes and shops torched and one man killed. Most of buildings torched belonged to residents from the Kenyatta s Kikuyu tribe.  One man from Odinga s Luo group was killed overnight near  Koguta village in the west of the country, after residents from two ethnic groups backing different candidates armed themselves.  If such isolated incidents become a trend, it could ignite large swathes of Kenya, as happened after a 2007 presidential election when weeks of violence left 1,200 dead. That sent ripples throughout East Africa, which relies on Kenya as a trade and diplomatic hub.  In his speech, Odinga condemned violence generally and did not single out any particular attack.   We have come here to give consolation to those who were beaten and killed. We as NASA condemn what happened,  he told worshippers at a church in Kawangware, referring to his National Super Alliance, an opposition coalition.  Odinga boycotted Thursday s vote because he said the contest would not be fair. Instead, he wanted the Oct. 26 contest dismissed and fresh elections held within 90 days.  His withdrawal means Kenyans are watching the turnout, rather than the result, for an indication of Kenyatta s popularity for a second, five-year term.  Results published on Sunday by the election commission showed that Kenyatta had won slightly more than 98 percent of the vote with results in from 244 out of 291 constituencies.  Turnout for the constituencies counted so far was 43 percent. That figure is likely to decrease when it includes returns of 0 from least 23 constituencies where authorities were unable to open even a single polling station because of protests by Odinga s supporters.  The election board planned to try to hold elections there on Saturday, but postponed the plan amid fears of further violence. ",worldnews,"October 29, 2017 ",0

"Weeks after row over academic articles, China says imported publications must be legal","BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese importers of foreign publications must verify the products are legal, China said on Friday, weeks after a British academic publisher which blocked access to hundreds of scholarly articles in the country reposted the material. Cambridge University Press (CUP) said in August that it had removed some 300 papers and book reviews published in the China Quarterly journal from its website in China following a request from the Chinese government.  It said it had blocked the articles, which covered sensitive topics, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy protests, the 1960s Cultural Revolution and Tibet, in order to keep its other academic and educational materials available in the country. The move sparked an outcry from academics, who attacked the decision as an affront to academic freedom. CUP, the publishing arm of Britain s elite Cambridge University, later reversed its decision and reposted the articles. China s State Council Information Office, responding by fax two weeks after a Reuters request for comment, said that publishers choose for themselves to import materials based on market demand and the law.  All publications imported into China s market must adhere to Chinese laws and regulations. Publication importers are responsible for checking the content of their imported publications,  it said without elaborating. It did not mention CUP. At the time, China s education ministry, foreign ministry, cyberspace administration and state publishing authority all declined to comment. The ruling Communist Party s efforts to censor news and information have sometimes backfired or left outsiders perplexed. In 2009, software designed to check pornographic and violent images on PCs blocked images of a movie poster for cartoon cat Garfield, dishes of flesh-colour cooked pork and on one search engine a close-up of film star Johnny Depp s face. But under President Xi Jinping, Beijing has stepped up censorship, tightened controls on the internet and various aspects of civil society, and reasserted party authority over academia and other institutions.

" Ted Nugent Calls For Hillary’s Murder AGAIN, Conservatives Silent (VIDEO)","The Right has been in a frenzy over comedienne Kathy Griffin s distasteful piece of artwork featuring Donald Trump s decapitated head, causing many to remember a simpler time when someone could literally threaten the president repeatedly and get invited to the next president s Oval Office to hang out.Ted Nugent   a racist douchebag who sh*t his pants to dodge the draft and once adopted a minor child so he could legally have sex with her   has repeatedly threatened and called for the deaths of  President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over the years as the Right defended his patriotic expressions of free speech that totally weren t threats at all.While one might expect Nugent to shut up long enough to allow the vipers on the Right to continue striking at Griffin for her distasteful work of art, Nugent isn t that smart.

BILL O’REILLY ASKS TRUMP “Racist” Question That Has Many Outraged…Was Bill Out-Of-Bounds This Time? [VIDEO],"Was O Reilly out-of-bounds? Most Americans would likely agree that we need to address the viability of employment opportunities for poorly educated Americans of every race who are walking around with multiple facial piercings and tattoos on their faces.Donald Trump appeared on The O Reilly Factor Monday night, but for once it wasn t the presidential candidate making headlines for his controversial remarks.Instead, it was Bill O Reilly himself who sparked fury after making statements about African-Americans that many called racist.During the interview, O Reilly pointed out that Trump is not polling well among minority voters, and questioned the Republican front-runner about his strategy for winning over black voters.Trump responded by saying he was doing  fantastic with African-Americans and with Hispanics  before launching into a speech about how the real issue was that jobs were being outsourced to countries like China and Mexico.O Reilly then pushed Trump to explain exactly how he could promise jobs to black voters, while offending many African-Americans at the same time. How are you going to get jobs for them?  O Reilly asked.  Many of them are ill-educated and have tattoos on their foreheads, and I hate to be generalized about it but it s true, if you look at all the educational statistics, how are you going to give jobs to people who aren t qualified for jobs?  Via: Daily MailBy the way Bill, there are no shortage of white people or Hispanics walking around with face tattoos.

 ‘White Lives Matter’ Rally Breaks Out In Chaos As Neo-Nazi Attacks Protesters (VIDEO),"As many of us could have predicted would be the outcome, a  White Lives Matter  rally broke out in chaos and a brawl ensued.The rally was held in South Buffalo, New York on Saturday afternoon, organized by the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement. When the rally took place in Cazenovia Park, only one neo-Nazi official was among the other supporters  white supremacist Karl Hand. Hand, who is also the chief of the Racial Nationalist Party of America, revealed he d had little involvement in organizing the rally: I didn t organize it. I was just invited to speak. But that didn t stop him from p*ssing people off and spewing his racist views. One video of the event even shows a woman scolding Hand and telling him that nobody is going to take your sh*t in this day and age, you are sick people  the rest of the United States is going to trample you out. In protest of the event, over 300 activists came out, which outnumbered the White Lives Matter supporters tremendously. The protesters held signs that said,  Not Here,   Black Lives Matter  and,  We promote unity in Buffalo.  Bridget Marren, one of the protesters in attendance and a South Buffalo native, said: We live here. We don t want that hate spread here. But what the White Lives Matter rallygoers lacked in attendance numbers, they made up in offensiveness. The Buffalo Police had dozens of officers at the rally to help control the crowd, but they still couldn t stop another racist neo-Nazi wearing a green  White Pride  t-shirt from getting into a fight with counter-protesters. The situation had eventually escalated so much that his shirt was ripped off when he got into a scuffle.You can watch the rally devolve into chaos in the videos below:But really, what else could we expect from a White Lives Matter rally?Featured image is a screenshot",News,"July 31, 2016",1
 Trump ‘Really Likes’ The Idea Of A Violent Uprising When He’s Impeached,"According to Trump ally Alex Jones, when Donald Trump is impeached all bets are off. He won t tell his supporters to accept the decision of the American people. He won t urge calm. In fact, he quite enjoys the idea of a violent uprising in his name.Recently, TMZ approached Trump ally Roger Stone in an airport and asked about impeachment. This is not 1974,  Stone said.  People will not stand for [the impeachment of President Trump]. Any politician who votes for it would be endangering their own life. There will be violence on both sides. Stone clarified that a civil war  will happen  if The Donald is impeached. I was told the president really liked Roger Stone s clip on TMZ when they confronted him in an L.A. airport saying,  We re going to impeach Trump.'  Jones said during an interview with recently pardoned criminal Joe Arpaio after the former Maricopa County sheriff  said that  people who want to take me down better watch out. Trump has never exactly shied away from violence. In fact, when people oppose him at his rallies, he quite literally tells his meth-addled fascist followers to attack them. He has even offered to pay legal fees for supporters who brutally beat black men at his events.Unfortunately for Trump s supporters, a violent uprising will not go so well for them. While they view the Left as anti-gun, many of us are well-armed and (unlike them) properly trained to defend ourselves. We just don t worship our weapons like they do.Watch the interview below:Featured image via Gerry Images (Ralph Freso)",News,"August 30, 2017",1
"Factbox: Who are Britain First, whose leader's posts Trump re-tweeted?","LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has re-tweeted anti-Islam videos originally posted by Jayda Fransen, a leader of a far-right British party convicted earlier in November of abusing a Muslim woman.  Fransen is deputy leader of the anti-immigrant Britain First group. Here are some details about her organization:  Britain First was founded in 2011 by leader Paul Golding with a membership of three individuals. It describes itself as a “patriotic political party and street movement”, although critics denounce it as a far-right, racist organization. “Britain First is committed to preserving our ancestral ethnic and cultural heritage, traditions, customs and values,” it says on its website.   It wants to deport all illegal immigrants, halt all further immigration, and introduce “a comprehensive ban on the religion of Islam” with headscarves being outlawed in public. “Anyone found to be promoting the ideology of Islam will be subject to deportation or imprisonment,” its policy platform states.   It holds protests across the country, usually attended by a couple of hundred supporters at most, many of whom hold white crosses because the group argues Christianity in Britain is being threatened by immigration and the growth of militant Islam.  Golding was a former senior figure in the far-right British National Party and was elected a local councillor in 2009. In his biography on the group’s website it says he was “sent to prison in 2016 for confronting a Muslim hate preacher who was secretly recorded saying it’s okay for Muslims to keep sex slaves”.  Golding stood for election as London mayor in May 2016, winning 31,372 votes, 1.2 percent of all cast.  Fransen, who was elected deputy leader in 2014, was convicted of religiously aggravated harassment in November 2017, and both she and Golding are facing further similar charges.   The group gained prominence in June 2016 when Labour lawmaker Jo Cox was shot dead on the street by a Nazi-obsessed loner who witnesses said had been shouting “Britain first” during the attack. Fransen told Reuters the killer had nothing to do with her group.  ",politicsNews,"November 29, 2017 ",0
The Trump presidency on March 23 at 7:03 P.M. EDT,"(Reuters) - Highlights of the day for U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration on Thursday: Trump fails to persuade enough skeptical members of his own Republican Party to begin dismantling Obamacare, forcing the House of Representatives to delay a vote on the healthcare legislation. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer pledges to pursue a procedural hurdle to try to block the confirmation of Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, a move that could provoke a nasty partisan fight and change the way the Senate does business. The Republican head of the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee apologizes for his handling of sensitive allegations about U.S. spy agency surveillance of President Donald Trump’s team. The State Department will approve on Friday the permit needed to proceed with construction of the Canada-to-United States Keystone XL oil pipeline, a project blocked by former President Barack Obama, according to government sources. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is directing U.S. diplomatic missions to identify “populations warranting increased scrutiny” and to toughen screening for visa applicants in those groups, according to diplomatic cables seen by Reuters. The Senate narrowly confirms Trump’s nominee for ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, an outspoken bankruptcy lawyer aligned with the Israeli right. Jay Clayton, the Wall Street attorney chosen by Trump to lead the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, defends himself against charges that he had multiple conflicts of interest that would cause him to miss too many SEC votes. Iran would face tighter U.S. sanctions over ballistic missile launches and other non-nuclear activities under a bill announced by a bipartisan group of senators, echoing a harder line on Tehran espoused by Trump. The Trump administration is preparing new executive orders to re-examine all 14 U.S. free trade agreements and review government procurement policies to aid American companies, two administration officials say. Two months after stepping down as Obama’s ambassador to Israel, Dan Shapiro sees some good in the initial peace efforts by the new Trump administration, even as he voices grievances against it. The Trump International Hotel in Washington is not in violation of federal conflict-of-interest rules that bar elected officials from taking part in a lease of federal property, the U.S. General Services Administration says.

WATCH: CHEROKEE PEOPLE Express Disgust Over “Lying” Elizabeth Warren Faking “Native American Heritage” To Get Prestigious Law Professor Job,"Oh look Hillary s considering a lying, opportunist, Democrat politician with a vagina as her running mate. It all makes perfect sense if you consider that Hillary s thinking ahead, and that if anything happened to her she wants to make sure she has someone with the same morals and ethics to fill her corrupt shoes In Warren s book  A Fighting Chance,  Massachusetts Democratic senator and potential vice presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren attempts to rewrite history regarding the controversy surrounding her  Native American  ancestry that emerged in the 2012 Senate campaign. What s remarkable is that, at least in the initial book reviews, the press largely allows her to get away with it. In fact, it s virtually ignored that to this day Warren still refuses to release any law school records that may shed light on this controversy.To be fair, most reviews note that Warren has never substantiated her claims of Native American heritage, which is true. The larger and unaddressed issue, however, is whether or not Warren falsely claimed minority status in order to gain an unfair advantage in her academic career. This was a question that was unresolved at the end of the 2012 campaign and it remains unresolved with the publication of Warren s book.Watch Cherokee people from ND tell how they feel about Lying Elizabeth using phony  Native American  status to gain an advantage in obtaining a job:First, what s perhaps most notable about Warren s book is that she even includes a section called  Native American,  in which she reportedly writes,  Everyone on our mother s side   aunts, uncles, and grandparents   talked openly about their Native American ancestry. My brothers and I grew up on stories about our grandfather building one-room schoolhouses and about our grandparents  courtship and their early lives together in Indian Territory. This is ironic because, until the Boston Herald first broke the news in April 2012 that Harvard Law School had repeatedly promoted Warren as a Native American faculty member, Warren never once mentioned these stories of her upbringing in a single press interview, speech, class lecture or testimony at any point, ever, in her decades-long career. What s more, Warren was not listed as a minority on her transcript from George Washington University where she began her undergraduate education, nor did she list herself as a minority when applying to Rutgers University Law School in 1973.In fact, it was not until she was in her 30s and focused on climbing the highly competitive ladder of law school academia that Warren apparently rediscovered her Native American heritage. It s important to note that entrance and advancement in the law school profession is governed by the Association of American Law Schools, which requires registrants interested in teaching at law schools to fill out a questionnaire detailing their education, experience, bar passage and, yes, ethnicity. This information is then disseminated to law schools around the country that, as Warren surely knew, are always on the lookout to add to the diversity of their faculty.A copy of Warren s questionnaire currently resides in the Association of American Law Schools archives at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. However, only Warren herself has the authority to release the complete copy of her questionnaire and to date, she has refused to do so.Watch Warren stonewalling the press over her phony  Native American  status and double down on her refusal to clear the record and release the copy of her questionnaire: Her opposition to such transparency can perhaps be understood in the documented fact that in the years thereafter, starting in 1986, Warren began self-reporting herself as a  minority professor  in the Association of American Law Schools staff directory that lists all law school professors around the country. As the former association chairman told the Boston Herald, the directory once served a tip sheet for law school administrators, in the pre-Internet days, who were looking to identify and recruit minority professors.Remarkably, Warren s explanation to the Boston Herald was that she listed herself as a minority in the hopes that she would be invited to a luncheon so she could meet  people who are like I am  and she stopped checking the box when that didn t happen. Perhaps it  didn t happen  because at no point, at any of the schools she attended or worked at, is there any evidence that Warren ever joined any Native American organizations on campus or in any way interacted with anyone in the Native American community.That did not however, stop Warren from continuing to self-report as a Native American minority. The New York Times reported in May 2012 that Warren was listed as a minority recipient of a teaching award years earlier at the University of Pennsylvania where she had advanced after teaching at several non-Ivy League law schools. Notably, Penn declined to explain to the Times why Warren was listed as a minority.From Penn, Warren moved on to Harvard Law School, where her Native American heritage was touted in multiple articles, including a Fordham Law Review piece that lauded her as Harvard Law s   first woman of color.  Even as recently as 2011, it appears Warren was listed as the lone Native American faculty member on the school s 2011  diversity report,  though like Penn, Harvard also refused to comment.Yet, when the Herald first broke the story in April 2012, Warren claimed she  had no idea  that Harvard had touted her Native American status and claimed she did not  recall  ever citing her Native American heritage when applying for a job. In the months afterward, Warren ducked, dodged and stonewalled subsequent questions, eventually wearing-out the press, and succeeded in winning an election without ever releasing any records that might substantiate those claims.Whether Warren falsely claimed to be a minority in order to game the system and advance her career is a question that goes to the heart of her honesty and integrity. It s also a question that will confront her if she ever seeks higher office. Via: US News",left-news,"Jun 19, 2016",1

Netanyahu lobbies world powers to stem Iraqi Kurd setbacks,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is lobbying world powers to prevent further setbacks to Iraqi Kurds as they lose ground to Baghdad s army, Israeli officials say. Israel has been the only major power to endorse statehood for the Kurds, partly, say analysts, because it sees the ethnic group - whose population is split among Iraq, Turkey, Syria and Iran - as a buffer against shared adversaries. Iraqi armed forces retook the oil-rich Kirkuk region this week, following a Sept. 25 referendum on Kurdish independence that was rejected by Baghdad, delivering a blow to the Kurds  statehood quest.      Israeli officials said Netanyahu raised the Iraqi Kurds  plight in phone calls with German Chancellor Angela Merkel last week and with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday.  It has also come up in his contacts with France and the Israeli national security adviser, Meir Ben-Shabbat, has been discussing the matter with Trump administration officials in Washington this week, the officials said. A Netanyahu government official, who declined to be named, given the sensitivity of Israel-Kurdish ties, suggested Israel had security interests in Kurdistan, given its proximity to Israel s enemies in Tehran and Damascus.  This (territory) is a foothold. It s a strategic place,  the official said without providing further detail. He said Israel wanted to see Iraqi Kurds provided with the means to protect themselves, adding:   It would be best if someone gave them weaponry, and whatever else, which we cannot give, obviously.      Israel has maintained discreet military, intelligence and business ties with Kurds since the 1960s, in the absence of open ties between their autonomous region in northern Iraq and Israel.  Netanyahu s recent lobbying has focused on Kurdish ambitions in Iraq, where the central Baghdad government has grown closer to Israel s foe Iran.            The issue at present is ... to prevent an attack on the Kurds, extermination of the Kurds and any harm to them, their autonomy and region, something that Turkey and Iran and internal Shi ite and other powers in Iraq and part of the Iraqi government want,  Netanyahu s intelligence minister, Israel Katz, told Tel Aviv radio station 102 FM on Friday.   It was not clear to what extent Netanyahu s outreach may have been solicited by the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq, which shies away from public engagement with Israel, worried about further alienating Arab neighbours.    The United Nations has voiced concern at reports that civilians, mainly Kurds, were being driven out of parts of northern Iraq retaken by Iraqi forces and their houses and businesses looted and destroyed.  The prime minister is certainly engaging the United States, Russia, Germany and France to stop the Kurds from being harmed,  Katz said.   Another Israeli official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, framed Netanyahu s efforts as a moral imperative.   They (Kurds) are a deeply pro-Western people who deserve support,  he said.  ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",0
"Exclusive: Returning Rohingya may lose land, crops under Myanmar plans","SITTWE, Myanmar (Reuters) - Rohingya Muslims who return to Myanmar after fleeing to Bangladesh are unlikely to be able to reclaim their land, and may find their crops have been harvested and sold by the government, according to officials and plans seen by Reuters. Nearly 600,000 Rohingya have crossed the border since Aug. 25, when coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks on security posts sparked a ferocious counteroffensive by the Myanmar army. The United Nations says killings, arson and rape carried out by troops and ethnic Rakhine Buddhist mobs since late August amount to a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya. Civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has no control over the military, has pledged that anyone sheltering in Bangladesh who can prove they were Myanmar residents can return. Reuters has interviewed six Myanmar officials involved with repatriation and resettlement plans. While the plans are not yet finalised, their comments reflect the government s thinking on how Suu Kyi s repatriation pledge will be implemented. Jamil Ahmed, who spoke to Reuters at a refugee camp in Bangladesh, is one of many Rohingya who hope to go back. Describing how he fled his home in northern Rakhine state in late August, Ahmed said one of the few things he grabbed was a stack of papers - land contracts and receipts - that might prove ownership of the fields and crops he was leaving behind.  I didn t carry any ornaments or jewels,  said the 35-year-old.  I ve only got these documents. In Myanmar, you need to present documents to prove everything.  The stack of papers, browning and torn at the edges, may not be enough, however, to regain the land in Kyauk Pan Du village, where he grew potatoes, chilli plants, almonds and rice.  It depends on them. There is no land ownership for those who don t have citizenship,  said Kyaw Lwin, agriculture minister in Rakhine state, when asked in an interview whether refugees who returned to Myanmar could reclaim land and crops. Despite his land holdings, Myanmar does not recognize Ahmed as a citizen. Nearly all the more than 1 million Rohingya who lived in Myanmar before the recent exodus are stateless, despite many tracing their families in the country for generations. Officials have made plans to harvest, and possibly sell, thousands of acres of crops left behind by the fleeing Rohingya, according to state government documents reviewed by Reuters. Myanmar also intends to settle most refugees who return to Rakhine state in new  model villages , rather than on the land they previously occupied, an approach criticized in the past by the United Nations as effectively creating permanent camps. The government has not asked for help from any international agencies, who are calling for any repatriation to be voluntary and to the refugees  place of origin. The exodus of 589,000 Rohingya - and about 30,000 non-Muslims - from the conflict zone in northern Rakhine has left some 71,500 acres of planted rice paddy abandoned and in need of harvesting by January, according to plans drawn up by state officials. Tables in the documents, reviewed by Reuters, divide the land into paddy sown by  national races  - meaning Myanmar citizens - or  Bengalis,  a term widely used in Myanmar to refer to the Rohingya, but which they reject as implying they are illegal migrants from Bangladesh. Kyaw Lwin, the state minister, confirmed the plans, and said there was a total of 45,000 acres of  ownerless Bengali land . Two dozen combine harvesters operated by officials from the agriculture ministry will begin cutting stalks this month in areas under military control. The machines will be able to harvest about 14,400 acres according to official calculations contained in the plans. It is unclear what will become of the remaining crop, but officials told Reuters they would try to harvest all the paddy, recruiting additional labor to harvest manually if necessary. An acre of paddy in Myanmar typically makes more than $300 at market, meaning the state will gain millions of dollars worth of rice. The harvested rice will be transported to government stores, where it would either be donated to those displaced by the conflict or sold, Rakhine state secretary Tin Maung Swe told Reuters by phone.  The land was abandoned. There is no one to reap that, so the government ordered to harvest it,  he said. Human Rights Watch (HRW) deputy Asia director Phil Robertson, said the government should at least guarantee that the rice would be used for humanitarian support and not for profit.  You can t call a rice crop  ownerless  just because you used violence and arson to drive the owners out of the country,  he said. Many refugees are fearful to return and are skeptical of Myanmar s guarantees. Those who do decide to cross back into Myanmar will first be received at one of two centers, according to government plans reviewed by Reuters, before mostly being relocated to model villages. International donors, who have fed and cared for more than 120,000 mostly Rohingya  internally displaced persons  (IDPs) in supposedly temporary camps in Rakhine since violence in 2012, have told Myanmar that they will not support more camps, according to aid workers and diplomats.  The establishment of new temporary camps or camp-like settlements carries many risks, including that the returnees and IDPs could end up being confined to these camps for a long time,  said U.N. spokesman Stanislav Saling in an emailed response. Satellite imagery shows 288 villages, mostly Rohingya settlements, have been fully or partially razed by fires since Aug. 25, according to HRW.  Refugees say the army and Buddhist mobs were responsible for most of the arson. The government says Rohingya militants and even residents themselves burned the homes for propaganda. The hamlets where Rohingya farmers lived were  not systematic , and so should be rebuilt in smaller settlements of 1,000 households set out in straight rows to enable development, said Soe Aung, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement.  In some villages there are three houses here, four houses over there. For example, there s no road for fire engines when fire burns the villages,  Soe Aung said. Those who decide to cross back into Myanmar will first be received at one of two centers, according to government plans reviewed by Reuters. At the centers, officials said, the returnees will fill out a 16-point form that will be cross-checked with local authorities  records. Immigration officials have for years visited Rohingya households at least annually for checks, photographing family members. For refugees who lost all their documents, the government would compare their photos to those that immigration authorities have on file, said Myint Kyaing, the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population. Officials will accept as evidence  national verification  cards handed out in an ongoing government effort to register Rohingya that falls short of offering them citizenship. The card has been widely rejected by Rohingya community leaders, who say they treat life-long residents like new immigrants.  We are not going to go back like this,  said Mushtaq Ahmed, 57, a farmer from Myin Hlut village now living in the Tenkhali refugee camp in Bangladesh, where Jamil Ahmed is also staying.  If I can go back to my house, and get my land back, only then I will go. We invested all our money into those paddy fields. They are killing so many of us with swords and bullets, and killing the rest of us like this.  ",worldnews,"October 22, 2017 ",0

Trump asks Supreme Court to block travel ban ruling,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Friday asked the Supreme Court to block a judge’s ruling that prevented President Donald Trump’s travel ban from being applied to grandparents of U.S. citizens and refugees already being processed by resettlement agencies. In a court filing, the administration asked the justices to overturn Thursday’s decision by a U.S. district judge in Hawaii, which limited the scope of the administration’s temporary ban on refugees and travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. The latest round in the fight over Trump’s March 6 executive order, which he says is needed for national security reasons, came after the Supreme Court intervened last month to partially revive the two bans, which were blocked by lower courts. The Supreme Court said then that the ban could take effect, but that people with a “bona fide relationship” to a U.S. person or entity could not be barred.  The administration had narrowly interpreted that language, saying the ban would apply to grandparents and other family members, prompting the state of Hawaii to ask Hawaii-based U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson to expand the definition of who could be admitted. He ruled for the state late on Thursday. In the court filing, the Justice Department said the judge’s ruling “empties the (Supreme) Court’s decision of meaning, as it encompasses not just “close” family members but virtually all family members. The conservative-leaning Supreme Court is not currently in session but the justices can handle emergency requests. The administration’s application could be directed either to Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has responsibility for emergency requests from western states, or to the nine justices as a whole. If the court as a whole is asked to weigh in, five votes are needed to grant such a request. “The truth here is that the government’s interpretation of the Supreme Court’s stay order defies common sense,” said Omar Jadwat, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union involved in challenging the ban. “That’s what the district court correctly found and the attorney general’s misleading attacks on its decision can’t change that fact.” In his decision, Watson harshly criticized the government’s definition of close family relations as “the antithesis of common sense.” Watson also ruled that the assurance by a resettlement agency to provide basic services to a newly arrived refugee constitutes an adequate connection to the United States because it is a sufficiently formal and documented agreement that triggers responsibilities and compensation. In the court filing, the Justice Department said Watson’s ruling on refugees would make the Supreme Court’s decision on that part of the executive order “effectively meaningless.” The ruling, if left in place, means refugees can continue to be resettled in the United States, beyond a cap of 50,000 set by the executive order. That limit was reached this week.  The Supreme Court’s decision last month revived parts of Trump’s March 6 executive order banning travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, as well as refugees for 120 days. The court also agreed to hear oral arguments in the fall over whether the ban violates the U.S. Constitution. ",politicsNews,"July 14, 2017 ",0
Xi's power on parade as China party congress looms,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The recent scene at a dusty Inner Mongolia military base provided evidence of Chinese President Xi Jinping s consolidation of political power, even as he faces pushback from some quarters in his ruling Communist Party ahead of a critical gathering next month. Dressed in army fatigues, Xi reviewed a military parade on July 30 marking the 90th founding anniversary of the People s Liberation Army (PLA). Breaking with precedent at such events, Xi   who is head of the party and the military as well as president - did not share the stage with peers or party elders. PLA General Fan Changlong, in a further departure from the norm, hailed Xi as  lingxiu , or leader, a reverent honorific bestowed only on two others since the 1949 founding of the People s Republic of China: Chairman Mao Zedong and his short-lived successor, Hua Guofeng. According to six sources with ties to the leadership, as well as Chinese analysts and foreign diplomats, that display and others sent a clear signal of his increasingly dominant position in the runup to the Party s congress starting on Oct. 18, a meeting that is only held once every five years. Rana Mitter, director of the University of Oxford China Centre, said the  lingxiu  title would suggest Xi had succeeded in one of his key aims to  centralize as much authority and charisma under his own person  as possible. But as Xi s supporters promote his agenda, some party insiders, wary that he will accumulate too much power and effectively end three decades of collective leadership, have delayed agreement on who will end up on the party s Standing Committee, the apex of power, currently made up of seven men.  There is opposition to Xi getting too much power,  said a source with ties to the leadership. The State Council Information Office, which doubles as the party s spokesman s office, did not respond to a request for comment for this story. As is typical in the run-up to the Congress, competing name lists have been circulating in leadership circles for the Standing Committee, but sources caution they are possibilities rather than the final line-up.  There is an anti-Xi faction forming up,  said a Beijing-based diplomatic source, citing meetings he has had with Chinese officials.  It remains to be seen if he ll get it all his own way for the Standing Committee.  Key questions include whether Xi ally and top corruption buster Wang Qishan will stay on past traditional retirement age and, whether Xi will get his supporters in all the key positions. There will also be a lot of attention on any moves that would enable Xi to stay on in some top leadership capacity after his second term ends in 2022. Xi is required by the country s constitution to step down as president after two five-year terms. There is no limit on his tenure as the party and military chief, though a maximum 10-year term is the norm. Distinct from the standard usage of  lingdao  for leader,  lingxiu  evokes grander, almost spiritual, connotations.  The party is gearing up to put Xi on the same level as Mao,  another  Beijing-based diplomatic source said, referring to the significance of the  lingxiu  term.  The Central Party School, which is the top training ground for up-and-coming cadres and is influential in interpreting and disseminating party directives, has since the military parade used  lingxiu  in official party language to refer to Xi.  The Study Times, the school s official newspaper, referred  to Xi as  lingxiu  for the first time on Aug. 21.   This is the choice made by history, made by the people,  it said. The military s official PLA Daily also referred to Xi as  lingxiu  on Aug. 25. However, the People s Daily, the party s official newspaper, has yet to call Xi  lingxiu .  If Xi becomes  lingxiu  at the congress, it would be tantamount to being party chairman,  another source with leadership ties said.  Xi is currently the party s general secretary, but not chairman. China s first three leaders after the founding of the People s Republic in 1949 all carried the title party chairman -Mao, Hua and then Hu Yaobang. It has not been used since.  It would be a life-long tenure,  the source said, adding that adopting such a title would be easier than amending the party charter to resurrect the chairmanship, which was abolished in the early 1980s to prevent another Mao-like personality cult. Xi added  core  to his slew of titles last October.  If he were to be formally anointed  lingxiu  during the congress, his political clout would eclipse that of the past few presidents, the sources said. It would effectively grant him veto power on any major decision put to the Standing Committee, they said. For decades, the Communist Party general secretary has been technically first among equals in the Standing Committee under a collective leadership model designed to avoid one-man rule. While western analysts largely view Xi s centralization of authority as having a possibly narrowing effect on China s potential for further radical economic reform, three sources with leadership ties said Xi wants a strong hand precisely to force through changes that are resisted by vested interests.  This kind of title is essential,  a source with ties to the leadership told Reuters.  China at this juncture needs this kind of powerful man in control.  ",worldnews,"September 1, 2017 ",0

The pope is writing a document on fake news - and that's the truth,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - If you ever wondered how to say  fake news  in Latin, it s  nuntii fallaces  - and Pope Francis is writing a document on just that. Francis announced it himself in a tweet to his nearly 40 million followers on Friday, saying the theme of his message for the Roman Catholic Church s next World Day of Social Communications will be  The truth will set you free. Fake news and journalism for peace.  In Latin, one of the nine languages the pope uses to tweet, that would be  Veritas liberavit vos. Nuntii fallaces et diurniariorum opus ad pacem.  A Vatican statement said the issue was important enough for the pope to address because  fake news contributes to generating and nurturing a strong polarisation of opinions.  A distortion of facts, it said, can have  repercussions at the level of individual and collective behaviour.  Francis said in an interview last year that media that focus on scandals and spread fake news to smear politicians risk becoming like people who have a morbid fascination with excrement. The Vatican statement said the leader of the 1.2 billion member Church wanted to offer  a reflection on the causes, the logic and the consequences of disinformation in the media, and helping to promote professional journalism, which always seeks the truth . The Church s next World Day of Social Communications will be celebrated on May 13. The pope s message will be released on January 24, feast of St Francis de Sales, the patron of journalists.

WOW! LATINO GROUP Aired TERROR-LIKE TV Ad Only Days Ago Showing White Man Threatening To Plow Down Muslim and Minority Kids With Truck [VIDEO],"When supporters of the Democrat Party start using ads that appear to be inspired by Islamic acts of terror, you know they are not the party your parents and grandparents supported, and they re certainly not the party that most Americans want to be affiliated with. When the Latino Victory group released a disgusting video (see below) a couple of days ago, many thought that it was made to resemble terror attacks that have become all too common in European nations. Sadly, today, that concept of using a truck as a weapon to kill innocent people became a reality in New York City, as an Islamic terrorist driver used a rented Home Depot truck as a weapon to kill 9 innocent people and to injure dozens more.Note to Democrats: Creating a terror-inspired ad with a man chasing down innocent kids in a truck through their neighborhood is not funny, and it s definitely not a clever way to get people to vote for your candidate. According to FOX News   Democratic candidate for Virginia governor Ralph Northam is not distancing himself from the controversial ad suggesting supporters of Republican candidate Ed Gillespie are seen as Confederates who attack minority children.The new opposition ad titled  American Nightmare  was released Monday by Democratic group Latino Victory Fund (LVF) and is scheduled to run through Election Day. The opposition ad shows minority children seemingly being chased by a driver in a pickup truck, decked out with a Confederate flag, a  Gillespie for governor  bumper sticker and a  Don t tread on me  license plate.The driver makes his way toward the scared children who shout,  Run! Run! Run!  when they see the truck. The ad concludes with a scene of a Charlottesville-like rally, with a narrator asking:  Is this what Donald Trump and Ed Gillespie mean by the  American Dream? The Latino Victory group tweeted the video that was so violent, that Twitter has now suspended their account. Here is what their tweet said:Ed Gillespie and Donald Trump promise the American dream, but can only deliver an American nightmare. No more. Vote @RalphNortham. #GameOnVA pic.twitter.com/mwpWXM47HZ  Latino Victory (@latinovictoryus) October 30, 2017Northam s campaign told Fox News Tuesday that the ad was  not shocking  based on Gillespie s campaign. Independent groups are denouncing Ed Gillespie because he has run the most divisive, fear-mongering campaign in modern history,  Northam campaign spokeswoman Ofirah Yheskel said in a statement to Fox News.  It is not shocking that communities of color are scared of what his Trump-like policy positions mean for them. But Gillespie said the ad was  an attack on  his  supporters,  whom he calls  good decent hardworking Virginians who love their neighbors. - FOX NewsMaking an ad that depicts a white man with a confederate flag flying from his pick-up truck, sporting an Ed Gillespie (Republican candidate for Governor) bumper sticker on the back, chasing minority kids around their neighborhood is not only sick, it is hateful and divisive.

Mexican army hit by execution finding as Senate mulls new military powers,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican soldiers arbitrarily executed two people after an illegal raid last year, a national rights body said on Tuesday, releasing its findings as protests disrupted a debate in the Senate over a contentious bill to give the military more powers. The military, deployed in Mexico s war on drug gangs for over a decade, has been embroiled in several rights scandals including the extrajudicial killings of gang members and the disappearance of 43 students near one of its bases in 2014. The case reported by the National Human Rights Commission on its website on Tuesday related to a raid on a home in the western state of Jalisco last year.  The Commission, chosen by the Senate and autonomous from Mexico s federal government and its president, said the soldiers had tortured and sexually abused people they found there. After arbitrary detention, soldiers killed two of them by breaking their necks, the Commission said. While its rulings are not binding, the Commission s recommendations are influential and require a response from the institutions it reports on.   The timing is awkward for President Enrique Pena Nieto s  government, as it faces widespread criticism over legislation passed in the lower house and now in the Senate that seeks to enshrine in law the use of the military in crime fighting. The United Nations human rights chief on Tuesday called on Mexican lawmakers not to pass the bill, saying Mexico needed a stronger police force. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein said the law did not contain strong enough controls to protect civilians from abuses in Mexico, where extrajudicial killings, torture and disappearances are carried out by both security forces and criminal gangs.  Adopting a new legal framework to regulate the operations of the armed forces in internal security is not the answer. The current draft law risks weakening incentives for the civilian authorities to fully assume their law enforcement roles,  Zeid said in a statement. Protesters successfully blocked discussion of the bill for much of Tuesday, barring access points to the Senate, and laying out placards warning against the militarization of the country while pointing to a massive rise in killings since President Felipe Calderon first put the army on the streets in 2016. In his presidential campaign, Pena Nieto promised to develop a large new national police force, but has ended up relying on military forces for high-profile operations. Murders in Mexico in 2017 are on track to be the worst on record, with 20,878 nationwide in the first 10 months. Lawmakers are expected to push the bill through committees and later put the measure to a full vote on the Senate floor. Lower house lawmakers moved quickly on the bill last week after it had languished in committees for years. The law has broad support from the ruling party and members of the opposition National Action Party who say it will give clear rules limiting the use of soldiers to fight crime.   The law is aimed at avoiding the discretional use of the armed forces by the president,  PAN Senator Roberto Gil Zuarth told reporters.  Right now there are no rules. He doesn t have to tell anybody.  However, rights campaigners worry the law opens the door to military intervention in protests, as well as expanding military powers to spy on citizens.  It is opposed by the party of leftist presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, which has only a handful of senators, but wants to return soldiers to their barracks over time. Julia Klug, 65, an activist from Mexico City protesting outside the Senate with  no violence  written on her face, said the law would entrench the role of the armed forces in a struggle with criminals that was not theirs to fight.  It s the Navy that s committing murder, it s the Army that s carrying out kidnappings. The police was corrupt, but these guys are criminals,  she said holding up a Mexican flag with the eagle at the centre of it spattered in red. ",worldnews,"December 6, 2017 ",0

White House candidate Trump announces Pence as his running mate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump’s choice of Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate on Friday helped bolster support among some conservatives skeptical about his policies, a crucial step as he prepares to accept the party’s nomination next week. Some conservatives who had fought against Trump’s ascendancy in the Republican nominating race welcomed his announcement that he had picked Pence, a well-known social and evangelical conservative. The Club for Growth, a conservative economic group, had sharply criticized Trump’s support for protectionist trade policies. On Friday, the group noted that as a member of the House of Representatives, Pence had been a strong voice for “free markets and economic liberty” at a time when the Republican leadership had been weak on these issues. “Today’s news gives a similar hope that Mike Pence will be  effective in pulling the Republican ticket toward economic conservatism and limited government,” the group said. Other conservatives were also heartened by Trump’s VP pick, which the businessman announced in a tweet ahead of a joint appearance in his hometown of New York on Saturday. “Pence is a principled conservative, man of faith, and talented messenger for Republican ideas,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. “His addition to the ticket will bring even more excitement to the voters who are eager to put a Republican in the White House and deny a third term for President Obama’s liberal agenda.” Trump, 70, chose Pence, 57, over two politicians he considers friends and close advisers, former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, 73, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, 53. Pence is viewed as a safe choice for Trump. The Indiana governor’s low-key demeanor is a contrast to that of the bombastic real estate developer. And he could take the fight to the Democrats in the months leading up to the Nov. 8 election without upstaging Trump. He and Trump will have to smooth over some policy differences. Pence has said he does not support trade protectionism or a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, two policies that are central to Trump’s campaign message. In his first public remarks after Trump announced his running mate, Pence appeared to soften his opposition to a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country after he called it  “offensive and unconstitutional” in a tweet last December. “I am very supportive of Donald Trump’s call to temporarily suspend immigration from countries where terrorist influence and impact represents a threat to the United States,” Pence told conservative Fox News commentator Sean Hannity. “We have no higher priority than the safety and security of the American people,” Pence said, adding that he suspended a Syrian refugee program in Indiana after a shooting rampage last year in San Bernardino, California.  Pence also said he “absolutely” backed Trump’s promise to build a wall between the United States and Mexico to stem illegal immigration and make Mexico pay for it. Trump said Pence had done a great job in Indiana and that of all the people he had interviewed for the job, “there’s nobody that agrees with me fully on everything.” Pence’s selection was slammed by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. “By picking Mike Pence as his running mate, Donald Trump has doubled down on some of his most disturbing beliefs by choosing an incredibly divisive and unpopular running mate known for supporting discriminatory politics and failed economic policies that favor millionaires and corporations over working families,” said Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta. Trump had faced a midday Friday deadline to announce Pence because the governor had to declare by then whether he would be on the ballot in his home state for re-election. Trump had postponed his announcement, which had been planned for Friday, out of respect for the victims in Nice, France. An attacker in a heavy truck drove into crowds celebrating Bastille Day, killing at least 84 people and injuring scores more in what President Francois Hollande called a terrorist act. Trump is set to be formally nominated as the party’s candidate for the presidential election at the convention, which opens in Cleveland on Monday. Traditionally, the vice presidential choice is used to build enthusiasm among party loyalists. The Republican National Committee expects the convention to draw 50,000 people to the Ohio city, whose population is about 390,000. U.S. authorities were preparing for the possibility of violence, whether from demonstrators or planned attacks. The Cleveland conclave and the Democratic Party Convention the following week in Philadelphia have been given the status of special national security event by the federal government for the first time, and security will be heightened, said Republican Party spokesman Sean Spicer. The Department of Homeland Security will send more than 3,000 personnel to each convention, Secretary Jeh Johnson said on Thursday, speaking before the Nice attack. No specific or credible threat to either gathering has been reported, he said. ",politicsNews,"July 15, 2016 ",0
" Hooded Men Spray-Paint Racial Slurs, Pro-Trump Graffiti At UCSD Campus (VIDEO)","Students at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) are demanding campus officials identify the individuals responsible for spray-painting racist graffiti, along with pro-Donald Trump messages, on campus property overnight on Saturday.According to the local CBS affiliate, the vandalism was carried out by five men wearing hoods, who were seen by UCSD students.This weekend UCSD is hosting prospective students from around the world, who will be making a decision about which school to attend in 2017.Cultural buildings on campus, which faculty says are there to help racially diverse students  feel welcome  at UCSD, were specifically targeted with the messages.The graffiti included messages directed at Muslims, Jews, LGBTQ people and other groups.CBS8 visited the campus as the graffiti was being removed. According to their report, some of the language used by the vandals was too offensive to show on camera.One message was clear, however. Spray-painted on the sidewalk outside of a main campus building were the words  Build the wall  and  Deport them all.   #DonaldTrump  was also spray-painted on the walkway, along with the words  The Mexicans will pay for it. Watch the video, courtesy of CBS 8.CBS News 8   San Diego, CA News Station   KFMB Channel 8The graffiti incident has served to escalate longstanding racial tensions on UCSD s campus.In 2010, incidents of racism came to a head after videos of the infamous  Compton Cookout,  were shown on a campus television program. The  ghetto-themed  party, organized by white students, was designed to make a mockery of Black history month.After a noose was found hanging from one of the buildings on campus, a student walk-out, accompanied by large scale protests on campus led to the declaration of a  racial emergency. In order to diffuse tensions, university officials accepted a list of 32 student demands presented by member of the Black Student Union.In the years since the  Compton Cookout,  students have routinely criticized campus officials for failing to live up the 2010 agreement.The rise of Donald Trump has led to an increase of similar racist activity at Universities across the country.Trump has lent his stamp of approval to hate speech and to the kind of race-hatred that is only expressed by hooded men, under the cover of darkness.Featured image via video screen capture CBS8",News,"April 10, 2016",1

#Hashtag Hell & The Fake Left," By Dady Chery and Gilbert MercierAll writers with a desire to rattle people out of their torpor occasionally wonder if it is worthwhile to continue to try to raise their voices over the din of lies and distractions.More and more for us, such thoughts are occasioned, not by the mainstream, which predictably treats all the pronouncements from the powerful as being newsworthy, but by the fake left, which lobotomizes most of whom it touches. The increasing sophistication of this group and its rate of expansion are astounding. Its purpose is to annihilate and replace the real left, and it is making great strides in this regard.The real left includes those who, like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK), came to realize that quantum leaps are the way to proceed, rather than tiny incremental change. The real left does not curry favor or approval from those in power; it challenges the social status quo and respects the inherent right of an injured and indignant population to rebel against authority. It is not for rent or for sale, and it does not cave in to power. Martin Luther King March (Image Source: Wikicommons)By contrast, the motivations of the fake left are money and fame: the preservation of their place in their ivory towers, together with all the trimmings of an upper middle class or wealthy lifestyle. For them, the path is smoothed and the wheels of the machine are oiled for lucrative book deals, speaking tours, radio and television interviews, and articles that are infinitely reverberated through approved sites in the Internet. Their spokespeople channel political ideas toward electoral cycles and transform revolutionary musings into banalities, paralysis, and futile actions. They attack the public s thought process itself and engender an attention-deficit disorder. Ideas are not pursued, shared, honed, and acted upon but instead displaced by fleeting slogans like  hope and change,  or  feel the Bern. Alternatively, the ideas are muddled, branded and labeled with names like  shock doctrine,   disaster capitalism,  or  climate capitalism,  so that they may be put away and no longer examined. An important function of the fake left is to diffuse legitimate, spontaneous defense. Righteous anger is made to give way to confusion, and the impetus to revolt is transformed into the futility of virtual actions. Slogans are used as vaccines to prevent the contagion of dissent. Thoughts, not quite fully formed and the beginning of spontaneous actions, like blockage of bridges and highways, quickly dissipate. They are aborted into quick visual scans of an image or rapidly associated with a few words, like  black lives matter,  and then shared on social media. Today, Thomas Paine s Common Sense would not kindle a revolution; instead it would be quoted, posted, pinned, and tweeted. The fake left is a decoy: a hunter s trap to break the leg of any possible revolution. One of the fake left s godfathers is the multibillionaire George Soros, who obviously believes that wealth equals wisdom and has come up with a clever model to launder his vast financial gains into global political influence. Soros has developed an extremely diversified portfolio of intellectual properties and non-governmental organizations (NGO) in more than 37 countries. Artists throughout the world who present their people as victims, and promote passivity and despair, are rewarded with support and prestigious prizes. Supported organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are accused not only of selectively collecting data on human rights abuses but also of exploiting some of those data to pressure countries into policy changes that are unrelated to human rights. Independent  journalism is a major focus of Soros  Open Society Foundation, which was founded in 1993, soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union and right before the explosion of the Internet. When US-friendly corrupt governments, and US-sponsored institutions like USAID and the United Nations are exposed by the real left, Soros-sponsored think tanks and news organizations like the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) spring into action and become the voice of reason, demanding that these organizations self-reform. Countless others, also related to the Open Society Foundation, echo and amplify their message. Dismantlement and profound systemic change are never on the agenda. In most of the world, and especially the US, elections are staged, with the primary goal being to let off steam from targeted sectors of the population. A secondary goal is to make a rigged political process appear believable and give the impression of a free exchange of ideas. The candidates are presented as caricatures that trigger an emotional identification in specific groups of people. In the US in 2016, the mean, misogynist and racist ugly American stereotype is served well by Donald Trump for the right. On the other side, the reincarnated Occupy leftist champion of social justice is played by Bernie Sanders. Nonetheless it is Hillary Clinton s turn to win. Trump and Sanders serve to keep the elections in the news and to make Clinton the only supposed pragmatic choice. The ambition of Sanders to beat Hillary Clinton is questionable in light of the fact that he did not run for the presidency in 2012, although the issues were the same, and he could have benefited then from the energy of Occupy. Sander s platform is a reactivation of the Occupy themes. Occupy, however, is not what it used to be. Indeed it is a perfect example of something from the real left that was hijacked. It began as a leaderless anti-capitalist movement called US Day of Rage, but soon it acquired leaders like Chris Hedges, and its most radical elements, like the Black Bloc anarchists, were vilified and excluded. The fake left poaches the narrative of the real left so as to kill it. Outright plagiarism and abundant appropriations and rewrites are hallmarks of the fake left.  Since it lacks a heartfelt leftist rhetoric, it must continually borrow one, ironically, to excoriate it so as to present a superficial version of it. Any critical examination will show that the self-proclaimed firebrands of the left have, for decades, never moved the revolutionary dial an iota. If books like Noam Chomsky s Occupy or Naomi Klein s Shock Doctrine, or Chris Hedges and Joe Sacco s Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt had been genuine, they would have brought people to the barricades in the streets, and there would surely have been attempts to suppress them. Instead the books have been celebrated and glorified by the media establishment, because these pseudo-radical manifestos have not brought action but paralysis.The latest offering by Naomi Klein, This Changes Everything, will, by design, change absolutely nothing at all, except the balance of her bank account. TOAST OF THE LEFT: Author Naomi Klein.Those few of us who are genuinely trying to change the course of events sometimes wonder how we can compete against this powerful new machine that appropriates our message, twists it, and then blasts a degraded version of it through countless bullhorns. Doesn t the public realize that wealth and fame are not the normal trappings of revolutionaries? Don t people know that revolution is never easy, and that if it appears to be, it is not real? If words like earth, nature, life, democracy, dissent, protest, love, and revolution are allowed to lose their weight, our voices will go the way of the song of the extinct Dodo bird. It is imperative that these words be reappropriated and reinfused with meaning.Revolutionary talk cannot be permitted to become an exercise in futile venting or a validation of passivity; to mean anything at all, it must be enacted in community.Dady Chery is the author of We Have Dared to Be Free, and Gilbert Mercier is the author of The Orwellian Empire.

"OBAMA LIES ABOUT Number Of Troops On Ground In Iraq…FLASHBACK, OBAMA 2009: [Video] “After nearly nine years, America’s war in Iraq will be over.”","It was more important for Obama to keep a pledge to his leftist donors, than to secure the nation of Iraq before pulling out our troops. And then there s that one little detail rarely discussed in liberal circles, Obama wanted to leave troops behind but the Iraqi government threatened Our Pansy In Chief that they would not give our US troops immunity in their courts. Thus, the master negotiator put his tail between their legs and scooted out of Iraq, bringing our brave men and women in uniform with him Oct. 2011- The U.S. is leaving behind a  sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq, with a representative government. -Barack Huessein ObamaObama claimed it was a  moment of success. The U.S. military has around 5,000 service members in Iraq, officials said on Monday, far more than previously reported, as the Obama administration quietly expands ground operations against the Islamic State.The number of American forces in Iraq has come under increased scrutiny following the death over the weekend of a Marine staff sergeant, the second combat casualty in renewed U.S. operations in Iraq. He was killed when militants launched rockets at a small U.S. base around the city of Makhmour. The existence of the Marine detachment had not been known prior to Staff Sgt. Louis F. Cardin s death.Officials at the Pentagon have declined to specify how Marines are serving at the outpost in northern Iraq, which they described as a satellite base positioned to protect American trainers at a nearby, larger base. Their presence in Iraq highlights the use of forces from Navy ships already in the Middle East. Via: Washington PostObama, Oct. 21, 2011:In a brief appearance at the White House, Mr Obama said:  Today I can report that, as promised, the rest of our troops in Iraq will come home by the end of the year. After nearly nine years, America s war in Iraq will be over. The remaining 40,000 US troops in Iraq, would, he said,  definitely be home for the holidays .He conspicuously declined to repeat the mistake of his predecessor George W Bush, who started the war in March 2003 and displayed a  Mission Accomplished  banner six weeks later, only for Iraq to descend into years of insurgency and sectarian violence that has claimed at least 100,000 civilian lives.Mr Obama however asserted that the  United States is moving forward from a position of strength . The last American soldier will cross the border out of Iraq with their head held high, proud of their service,  he said.The president stressed that he was meeting a withdrawal deadline reached earlier with the Iraqis, as well as keeping a pledge made as a candidate in 2008 to wind down the controversial war as fast as possible.But his statement masked the fact that his administration had wanted to keep a residual force of 4-5,000 beyond the end of the year in a training capacity that would also have acted as a prohibitive presence to neighboring Iran.Despite months of discussions however, it failed to win a continued guarantee of immunity for US troops from prosecution from the Iraqi government.

"Todd Palin in intensive care after snowmobile accident, wife says","(Reuters) - Former U.S. vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin on Tuesday said her husband is still in the intensive care unit of an Alaska hospital with multiple injuries, including broken bones and a collapsed lung, two days after a serious snowmobile accident. Todd Palin, 51, suffered multiple broken ribs, a broken shoulder blade and clavicle, as well as knee and leg injuries. He was back in surgery to repair several fractures, Sarah Palin said in a statement on social media on Tuesday. “Knowing Todd, once he’s cognizant, he’ll probably ask docs to duct tape him up and he’ll call it good,” she said. “He’s tough.” An attorney for Sarah Palin declined to comment. A representative for the hospital where Todd Palin is said to be receiving treatment could not be reached. The accident on Sunday forced Sarah Palin to cut short a campaign trip for Donald Trump, the front-runner in the race for the Republican Party’s presidential nomination. Palin, who has endorsed Trump, had been scheduled to campaign for him on Monday in The Villages, a central Florida retirement community of more than 100,000 residents which has its own newspaper and radio station.  Florida is one of five states holding nominating contests on Tuesday for the Nov. 8 general election. Trump campaign officials said Palin, 52, was returning to Alaska to be with her husband and they looked forward to her return to the campaign trail soon.

He believes that the entire investigation into Hillary s emails was a sham used to protect her and not investigate her. He says the same cast of characters is being used to investigate Trump scary stuff!Fox News reports:WASHINGTON   Newly released documents obtained by Fox News reveal that then-FBI Director James Comey s draft statement on the Hillary Clinton email probe was edited numerous times before his public announcement, in ways that seemed to water down the bureau s findings considerably.Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, sent a letter to the FBI on Thursday that shows the multiple edits to Comey s highly scrutinized statement.In an early draft, Comey said it was  reasonably likely  that  hostile actors  gained access to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s private email account. That was changed later to say the scenario was merely  possible.

 Jay Leno Wants Someone To Beat ‘The Crap’ Out Of Trump So He Learns This Valuable Lesson,"This presidential election has been bringing everyone out of the woodwork to reveal their opinions on who is running. Especially in regards to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.One person who seems to be abundantly clear about his opinion on Trump is former Tonight Show host Jay Leno. Sitting down with The Hollywood Reporter, Leno revealed, in so many words, that Trump needs to have some sense knocked into him, and maybe, just maybe, he d be a better person for it.Leno told The Hollywood Reporter: I think this is the problem with Donald Trump. I don t think anybody has just ever beaten the crap out of him, so he has this attitude of  whatever.  When you have the crap beat out of you, you learn how to negotiate, you learn how to deal with people. You learn that kindness is the greatest virtue you can have.I know people that say  Shut the f ing door  and I know people who say  Is it cold in here?  If you say  Is it cold in here?  someone will shut the door for you, and you haven t annoyed anybody or pissed anybody off. And that s my attitude about life, just trying to be kind.When you are poor it s easy to be kind. When you are rich and famous, it s not that it s hard to be kind, but it s harder because people suddenly start catering to your eccentricities or whatever it might be. And that s just the thing, Trump seems to have never been in a situation in his life where he s been forced to be kind. He s so used to everyone bending over backwards to please him, that he doesn t seem to think that he actually should be kind to others in return. This would definitely explain his bully behavior, and how he feels so entitled to pretty much everything, including the White House.Note: This article in no way is suggesting that Trump should be harmed. It is just revealing what Jay Leno said in an interview.Featured image via Kevin Winter/Getty Images",News,"September 14, 2016",1

Approximately 1,000 people attended the  summer celebration  event at the Pilgrim Monument & Museum in Provincetown, including the 70-year-old  Believe  singer, who did not perform, according to the Cape Cod Times.She then travels to the Hamptons in New York this weekend for even more fundraising events.The Clinton campaign s decision to prioritize private fundraisers over public campaign events appears to be twofold.Hollywood A-lister Jennifer Garner hosted a fundraiser for the Democratic nominee for president Hillary R.

Trump Labor Dept. nominee questions key Obama-era rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Labor Secretary nominee R. Alexander Acosta told a Senate committee on Wednesday he would abide by President Donald Trump’s directive to review a pending “fiduciary rule” for retirement investment advisers, indicating he believed it goes too far. Acosta told the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions that the fiduciary rule, slated to take effect on April 10 but which the department has proposed delaying, goes “far beyond” regulating the conduct of investment advisers. The Trump administration directed the department last month to review whether the Obama-era rule, which requires brokers offering retirement investment advice to put their clients’ interest first, was burdensome and out of step with current White House policies. Acosta likewise expressed reservations about another Obama administration rule issued last year that more than doubled the salary ceiling under which employees would be eligible for overtime pay, from $23,660 to $47,476 a year. Acosta said he had “serious questions as to whether the secretary of labor had the power to enact this in the first place.” A federal judge in November blocked the rule, which extended mandatory overtime pay to more than 4 million salaried workers. The Trump administration must decide whether to defend the rule, and Acosta’s statements indicated that, if confirmed, he may decline to do so. However, Acosta told senators he was sensitive to the fact that overtime rules have not been updated in more than a decade. During the three-hour hearing, Acosta said that while he felt both Republicans and Democrats had the shared goal of protecting the interests of U.S. workers, they may disagree about the best courses of action. Ultimately, Acosta told the panel, Cabinet secretaries are selected by Trump and tasked with deploying his administration’s vision. “We work for the president, he is our boss, and so all Cabinet officials ... will ultimately follow his direction unless we feel that we can’t and if we can’t, we resign,” Acosta said. Acosta, a former member of the National Labor Relations Board and dean of the Florida International University College of Law in Miami, was nominated to be labor secretary in February, one day after Trump’s original choice, Andrew Puzder, withdrew.  Acosta has had a decades-long career in public service and has been through multiple Senate vettings for previous appointments, making it is unlikely his nomination will be derailed. If he clears the panel, Acosta will come up for a confirmation vote before the full Senate. ",politicsNews,"March 22, 2017 ",0
Opposition groups quit Iraqi Kurdish government over protests,"BAGHDAD/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Opposition groups quit the government of Iraq s Kurdish region on Wednesday in protest at violent unrest in which at least three people were killed, with one group saying authorities had shown a flagrant disregard for life. In another test for the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq, the United States meanwhile called on authorities in the semi-autonomous region to respect press freedoms after it shut down a local broadcaster. The United Nations called for restraint on all sides. Tension has been high in the region since the central government in Baghdad imposed tough measures in response to an independence referendum on Sept. 25 called by the KRG in which Kurds voted overwhelmingly to secede. The move, in defiance of Baghdad, also alarmed neighbouring Turkey and Iran who have their own Kurdish minorities. Strains spilled onto the streets on Monday and Tuesday when Kurds joined protests against years of austerity and unpaid public sector salaries, with some burning down offices belonging to political parties. At least three people were killed and more than 80 wounded on Tuesday in clashes with Kurdish security forces in Sulaimaniya, local officials said. Some were injured when the crowd was shot at with rubber bullets and sprayed with tear gas. On Wednesday leading opposition movement Gorran withdrew its ministers from the KRG and Kurdistan Parliament Speaker Yousif Mohamed, a party member, resigned in response to the violence. Some have demanded the regional government s ousting.  We urge the international community to confront the flagrant disregard for life, liberty and democracy shown by the authorities in #Kurdistan Region,  Gorran said in a tweet. The Kurdistan Islamic Group (Komal), another opposition party with a smaller presence in parliament, also withdrew from the government. The U.S. embassy in Baghdad said on Wednesday it was worried about the closure of a local Kurdish broadcaster at the hands of Iraqi Kurdish security forces a day earlier.  We are concerned by recent actions to curb the operations of some media outlets through force or intimidation, specifically yesterday s raid by Kurdistan Regional Government security forces of the NRT offices in Sulaimaniya,  an embassy statement said. The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) also  said Kurdish authorities should respect media freedoms and that it was  deeply concerned  about violence and clashes during the protests. It called for restraint on all sides.  The people have the right to partake in peaceful demonstrations, and the authorities have the responsibility of protecting their citizens, including peaceful protesters,  UNAMI said in a statement. Kurdish Asayish security forces on Tuesday raided the offices of Kurdish private broadcaster NRT in Sulaimaniya province, and took the channel off the air. NRT s founder and opposition figure Shaswar Abdulwahid was also arrested at the Sulaimaniya airport on Tuesday. His family have asked for his release, amid local media reports that another NRT journalist was arrested in Sulaimaniya on Wednesday. In a statement on Tuesday, Kurdish Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani, who is on an official visit to Germany, told protesters that although he understood their frustrations, the burning of political party offices is  not helpful .  There were no major protests in the city on Wednesday. Security forces from the region s capital Erbil have been deployed to help quell the unrest in Sulaimaniya, security sources told Reuters.  After Tuesday s unrest, curfews were imposed in several towns across the wider Sulaimaniya province, some have lasted through Wednesday. Local media reported smaller protests in towns across the province, including Ranya and Kifri.  ",worldnews,"December 20, 2017 ",0

Suicide bomber kills 50 in Nigeria in mosque attack,"YOLA, Nigeria (Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed at least 50 people in northeastern Nigeria on Tuesday in an attack on a mosque which bore the hallmarks of a faction of the Islamist militant group Boko Haram. The bombing in Mubi in Adamawa state was one of the deadliest in Nigeria s northeast since President Muhammadu Buhari came to power in 2015 pledging to end Boko Haram s eight-year insurgency and attacks by the group on civilian and military targets. It brought to at least 278 the number of people killed in 2017, according to calculations by Reuters. There was no claim of responsibility.  Some of the dead were in pieces beyond recognition,  said Bayi Muhammad, a worshipper who escaped the blast because he was late for early morning prayers. Abubakar Othman, a police spokesman in Adamawa state, said the death toll was at least 50, but added that the tally could rise. Eight people were critically injured and more than 30 others hurt but in stable condition, said Idris Garga, the northeast regional coordinator for Nigeria s national emergency agency. Boko Haram held territory in Adamawa state in 2014. Troops pushed them out in early 2015, and the town of Mubi had itself been relatively peaceful until Tuesday s bombing. In a statement on Tuesday, Nigeria s president said the attack was  very cruel  and gave assurances his government would do  everything required  to secure the state from Boko Haram.  The militant group often mounts suicide attacks in public places such as mosques and markets. Last December, two schoolgirl suicide bombers killed 56 people and wounded dozens more at a market in Adamawa. The mosque blast bears the hallmarks of a faction led by Abubakar Shekau, which forces women and girls to carry out suicide bombings. The attacks often leave only the bomber dead. Boko Haram has waged an insurgency in northeastern Nigeria since 2009 in its attempt to create an Islamic state in the region. It has killed more than 20,000 and forced around 2 million people to flee their homes.  The group split in 2016 and the faction under Shekau is based in the Sambisa forest on the border with Cameroon and Chad and mainly targets civilians with suicide bombers. The other faction is based in the Lake Chad region and led by Abu Musab al-Barnawi. It mainly attacks military forces after quietly building up its strength over the past year. Most attacks focus on Borno state, the birthplace of the insurgency. The group held land around the size of Belgium in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states until early 2015 but was forced out by Nigeria s army and troops from neighboring countries.

JUSTICE SCALIA Found Dead With ‘Pillow Over His Head’…Why No Autopsy?,"It was just announced that there will be no autopsy of Justice Scalia after he was found dead in his room of  natural causes . Does anyone else out there think it should be mandatory for an autopsy to be performed? Since Justice Antonin Scalia was found dead in his resort hotel room at Cibolo Creek Creek Ranch on Saturday, questions have been flying about the immediate declaration of  natural causes  as the means of death.According to the ranch owner, Scalia was described as  animated and engaged  during dinner Friday night. He was one of three dozen invitees to an event unrelated to law or politics.Yet just hours later, after missing both breakfast and lunch, he was found dead of apparent natural causes. Later, media outlets reported he had suffered a heart attack.Houston businessman John Poindexter, who owns the 30,000-acre luxury ranch, recalled:  He was seated near me and I had a chance to observe him. He was very entertaining. But about 9 p.m. he said,  It s been a long day and a long week, I want to get some sleep. Poindexter knocked on Scalia s door about 8:30 the next morning. The door was locked and the judge did not answer. Three hours later, Poindexter returned from an outing and determined Scalia was still missing. We discovered the judge in bed, a pillow over his head. His bed clothes were unwrinkled,  said Poindexter. He was lying very restfully. It looked like he had not quite awakened from a nap,  he said.Scalia did not have a pulse and his body was cold, and after consulting with a doctor at a hospital in Alpine, Poindexter concluded resuscitation would have been futile. He then contacted federal authorities, at first encountering a series of answering services because he was calling on a weekend. Ultimately they became available and handled it superbly,  he said.  They flew in by helicopter. They told me to secure the ranch, which I did until this morning. Scalia s body was moved to an El Paso funeral home early Sunday, then driven from Marfa and arrived around 2:30 a.m. at Sunset Funeral Homes, according to spokesman Chris Lujan.Read more: wnd",Government News,"Feb 14, 2016",1

Violence flares in Washington during Trump inauguration,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Black-clad activists among hundreds of demonstrators protesting Donald Trump’s swearing-in on Friday clashed with police a few blocks from the White House, in an outburst of violence rare for an inauguration. At least 217 people were arrested in the melees, police said.  The burst of civil disorder followed a fierce presidential campaign that ended in a stunning victory for Republican Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8 and left the country divided.  Many of Trump’s supporters traveled to Washington to cheer their new president on Inauguration Day. Tens of thousands of detractors are expected to march peacefully on Saturday. In the violence, knots of activists in black clothes and masks threw rocks and bottles at officers wearing riot gear, who responded with volleys of tear gas and stun grenades as a helicopter hovered low overhead.  At one flash point, a protester hurled an object through the passenger window of a police van, which sped away in reverse as demonstrators cheered. Earlier, activists used chunks of pavement and baseball bats to shatter the windows of a Bank of America branch and a McDonald’s outlet, all symbols of American capitalism. Multiple vehicles were set on fire, including a black limousine. A knot of people dragged garbage cans into a street a few blocks from the White House and set them ablaze, later throwing a red cap bearing Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan into the flames. Police said six officers were injured in scuffles with protesters. The people arrested would be held overnight before making court appearances on Saturday, Peter Newsham, interim chief of the Metropolitan Police Department, told a news conference. Newsham added that police would continue to monitor security around the night’s celebrations. Friday’s protests played out just blocks from Pennsylvania Avenue, where New York businessman-turned-Republican politician Trump took part in the traditional parade a newly sworn in president takes from the U.S. Capitol to the White House. The various protest groups scattered around the city chanted anti-Trump slogans and carried signs with slogans including “Trump is not president” and “Make Racists Afraid Again.” “Trump is not going to be stopped at the top, he’s going to be stopped from the bottom, from people rising up,” said Ben Allen, a 69-year-old retired teacher from San Francisco. “We support the right of everybody in this country, no matter what nationality, what religion, the color of their skin, to be respected as a human being, and this guy doesn’t respect anybody.” Trump supporter Ryan Shiring, 21, stood nervously with a group of friends near a pile of smoldering trash cans. “We thought there would be protests but we didn’t expect violence,” said Shiring, a college student from Hartford, Connecticut. “We were hoping for a completely peaceful transfer of power.” Democratic officials, including Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, condemned the violence. The U.S. Secret Service, Washington police and other law enforcement agencies had about 28,000 officers in place to secure a roughly three-square-mile (7.8 square km) of the city. Trump, a former reality TV star, angered many liberal Americans during his stunningly successful campaign with demeaning comments on women and immigrants. His inauguration speech was a populist and nationalist rallying cry. Protesters and police said the violent activists were acting independently of organized opposition to Trump. The Disrupt J20 group on Twitter said its anger was not directed only at Trump, and that it would also have demonstrated had Democrat Hillary Clinton won the election last November. Not far from the White House, Bob Hrifko, a member of the Bikers for Trump group, said he was struck in the face with an aluminum chair when he tried to intervene in a scuffle involving police and protesters. “We need more order. This ain’t right,” said Hrifko, who was bleeding from a cut under his eye. The number of people who turned out for the midday swearing-in ceremony in the rain appeared to be significantly smaller than the estimated 2 million who attended Democrat Barack Obama’s first inauguration in 2009. Overhead video of the National Mall showed sections of the white matting laid down to protect the grass were largely empty. The city’s Metro subway system reported ridership levels as of 11 a.m. (1600 GMT) at less than half of what was seen in 2013 or 2009 and roughly on par with George W. Bush’s second inauguration in 2005. Sympathy protests were held around the nation and the world, in cities including Los Angeles, Tokyo and London.  In Seattle, one person was shot in the abdomen during a demonstration at the University of Washington, the Seattle Police Department said on Twitter. Demonstrators gathered there to protest Trump and conservative commentator Milo Yiannopoulos, who gave a talk on campus, local media reported.  In Portland, protesters threw rocks, bottles and flares at police dressed in riot gear, who fired irritant and flash-bang devices back at them, according to local media and police.  But in Moscow, Russians hoping Trump will usher in a new era of detente with their country celebrated his inauguration.  In Washington, David Guthrie, a long-haired, bearded, 36-year-old from South Bend, Indiana, stood stark naked on a street corner with an obscenity and “Trump” written on his buttocks in black magic marker. As he stood, he was pepper sprayed by police, but stood with his eyes clenched, saying he wanted to prompt “a national conversation on the illegitimacy of the Trump presidency.” “I need a shower,” he said, as fellow protesters helped him walk away, wrapped in a silver blanket.

 Elizabeth Warren Has Found BREATHTAKING Hypocrisy In FBI’s Treatment Of Hillary’s Emails,"Buckle up. Elizabeth Warren, continuing her crusade for the little guy, wrote a letter to FBI director James Comey over their transparency with Hillary s emails, because they didn t have that same transparency when investigating the big banks. In fact, they usually don t release anything when there s no indictment. They changed their standards for releasing information with Hillary, and Warren wants to know why that same standard can t be used on Wall Street executives. Your recent actions with regard to the investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton provide a clear precedent for releasing additional information about the investigation of the parties responsible for the financial crisis These new standards present a compelling case for public transparency around the fate of the FCIC referrals. If Secretary Clinton s email server was of sufficient  interest  to establish a new FBI standard of transparency, then surely the criminal prosecution of those responsible for the 2008 financial crisis should be subject to the same level of transparency. She s more than right; if Hillary s emails are of sufficient interest to release as much information as possible, then why isn t the information on those who have been proven to cause harm to millions of Americans by crashing the economy of the same interest? It should actually be of bigger interest than the witch hunt against Hillary.The FBI initially released information in response to several FOIA requests from the press, and sent more material to Congress. However, they didn t send over every last, little, tiny bit. The chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), incensed that they d spurn him like that, subpoenaed the full file earlier this week.Republicans all over Congress are pitching a hell of a tantrum over the FBI not releasing every last scrap of paper, but they really couldn t care less that the FBI didn t release anything after the Department of Justice decided not to prosecute eleven bankers that had a hand in destroying the economy. Why?Simple. When it s Hillary Clinton, everything has to be changed. She must be guilty of something; Republicans and Hillary-haters know things. When it s people who actually harmed America, though? Meh. Not that important why nobody was prosecuted. Here s hoping that Warren s letter has an impact on Comey, because we deserve to know exactly why bankers weren t prosecuted.Featured image by Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images",News,"September 15, 2016",1
 Betsy DeVos: Black Colleges That Came From Jim Crow Are Models Of ‘School Choice’,"Donald Trump s secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, doesn t just have trouble with grammar. Apparently, she struggles with American history as well.Following Trump s meeting with the leaders of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), DeVos sent out a tweet that can only be described as completely clueless. According to the new education secretary, HBCUs are pioneers of  school choice. Wowwowwow. These paragraphs are from a real, official US Department of Education statement from Betsy DeVos released today. pic.twitter.com/I2FDZfzdmt  Ankit Panda (@nktpnd) February 28, 2017DeVos couldn t have gotten things more backward if she had tried. Historically black schools aren t models of  school choice.  In fact, it is the exact opposite. These schools arose because there was no choice. Slaves were forbidden from learning how to read and write. Following their emancipation, most white schools refused to let black students in.The first HBCUs were started to educate black teachers so that black children would have a shot at receiving any type of education at all. Later, in addition to the private institutions that had been founded, southern states set up public colleges to serve blacks rather than integrate existing schools.If DeVos really believes this is something to aspire to, it certainly does explain a lot. As secretary of education, she plans to  fix  our  broken  education system by diverting federal funds from public schools to private schools, which are largely unregulated. Critics argue that this will serve only to accelerate the resegregation of American schools.Following the integration of public schools in America, white parents who didn t want their children to share classrooms with black students opted to send their children to private schools. In the decade following the passage of the Civil Rights Act, approximately half a million white students left public schools for private ones.Maybe DeVos isn t just an idiot with no understanding of history after all. Between her tweet and her vision for the future of American schools, we are forced to ask if taking our children and their education back to the days of Jim Crow has really been her intention all along.Featured image via Mario Tama/Getty Images",News,"March 2, 2017",1
Support for Irish PM's party falls as snap election nears,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Support for Ireland s governing Fine Gael party fell in a poll on Saturday as a political crisis that has left the country three days away from the calling of a snap election showed no sign of being resolved. Prime Minister Leo Varadkar s minority government was on the brink on Friday after the party propping it up submitted a motion of no confidence in the deputy prime minister, weeks before a summit on Britain s plans to leave the European Union where Ireland will play a key role. Varadkar has said that if the motion put down by Fianna Fail, the main opposition party, is not withdrawn by Tuesday, he would be forced to hold an election before Christmas. Support for his party dropped two points to 27 percent in the Sunday Business Post/Red C poll, only marginally ahead of the 25.5 percent it achieved at last year s election and its worst performance in recent opinion polls. Fellow center-right party Fianna Fail rose to 26 percent from 25 percent a month ago and leftwing opposition Sinn Fein were up two points to 16 percent, both also marginally higher than the last election. The survey was taken between November 20 and 24, the day the crisis escalated rapidly and suggested the parties would struggle to form anything but another minority administration.  Again (the poll) suggests no one wins at a Christmas election if these numbers hold,  Richard Colwell, the chief executive of Red C, wrote on Twitter. Varadkar has said that there is still time to avoid the snap poll but neither side were stepping down on Saturday ahead of the motion of no-confidence, to be debated on Tuesday.  Although the leaders will do their best, it is unlikely that the positions are going to shift between now and Tuesday, and if that is the case the only way we can prevent an election is for the Tanaiste to resign,  senior Fianna Fail MP Jim O Callaghan told national broadcaster RTE. The Tanaiste is the name given to the position of deputy head of government in Ireland, currently held by Frances Fitzgerald. Health Minister Simon Harris said the price of any talks over the next three days  will not be the head  of the deputy prime minister and that the agreement with Fianna Fail that allows the minority government to function was  extremely badly damaged.  Varadkar is due to play a major role in the Dec. 14-15 EU summit on Brexit, telling fellow leaders whether Dublin believes sufficient progress has been made on the future border between EU-member Ireland and Britain s province of Northern Ireland. The government has said enough progress has not been made to date. The border is one of three issues Brussels wants broadly resolved before it decides whether to move the talks on to a second phase about trade and EU officials have said a snap election in Ireland would complicate that task.

Trump eyeing Mnuchin and Ross for economy jobs: Icahn,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Longtime Donald Trump supporter and activist investor Carl Icahn confirmed on Tuesday that the president-elect is looking at Wall Street veteran Steven Mnuchin as his choice for treasury secretary and billionaire Wilbur Ross for commerce secretary.  “Spoke to @realDonaldTrump. Steve Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross are being considered for Treasury and Commerce. Both would be great choices,” Icahn wrote on Twitter.  Icahn, a close ally of Trump who was often praised by the Republican during the presidential campaign for his business acumen, also tweeted that both Mnuchin and Ross were friends and “two of the smartest people I know.” Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner and Trump’s campaign finance manager, has been considered a front-runner for the Treasury post for much of the past week since Trump’s stunning election victory. Mnuchin’s inclusion in Trump’s campaign team was questioned at the time by Stephen Bannon, now Trump’s chief White House strategist. In an interview on Breitbart News, Bannon asked Trump whether the then presidential candidate was “selling out to Wall Street”.  The list to head the Treasury Department has also included JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon and Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee. Hensarling has said he would prefer to focus on a revamp of financial regulation, while Dimon, a lifelong Democrat, has denied interest in the job in the past.         Ross, a billionaire investor, is a part of Trump’s economic advisory team. Calls to Ross were not immediately returned. Mnuchin walked through the Trump Tower lobby in Manhattan on Tuesday morning. He would not comment on personnel decisions but said the Trump team is “making sure we get the biggest tax bill passed, the biggest tax changes since Reagan. So a lot of exciting things in the first 100 days of the Trump presidency.” With Republicans retaining majorities in Congress, Trump will have a clearer shot at enacting major tax cut and reform legislation and rolling back the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation law passed in the wake of the financial crisis. The new treasury secretary would play a key role in crafting such legislation, as well as managing potential new debt issuance of as much as $1 trillion if Congress agrees to Trump’s proposed infrastructure spending program. With such high stakes, Wall Street is more focused on the selection of the next treasury chief than it was during President Barack Obama’s choices for the post. “This time will be different,” Gregory Peters, senior investment officer at Prudential Fixed Income, said Tuesday at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit in New York. “That role takes on greater importance.”     Unlike current Secretary Jacob Lew, who is viewed investors to have taken a lower profile focused largely on international issues over the past year, the next Treasury secretary is expected to be a featured player in articulating and executing the Trump administration’s new economic policies and initiatives.     A figure such as Mnuchin, with Wall Street experience, might be seen as better equipped to manage the relationship between Treasury and the banks that facilitate U.S. debt issuance.  The last Wall Street insider to serve in the post was Henry Paulson, the former Goldman Sachs CEO appointed by George W. Bush and whose term was dominated by the bank bailouts of the 2008 financial crisis. Mnuchin, whose father was also a Goldman Sachs partner,  worked at the investment bank for nearly two decades starting in the mid-1980s, a time when Wall Street was developing major financial innovations including new securitization techniques and collateralized debt obligations — instruments that would later contribute to the financial crisis. In 2009, he led a group of investors that purchased the assets of failed California-based mortgage lender IndyMac, for $1.55 billion that included a loss-sharing deal with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. After rehabilitating the operation and rebranding it as OneWest Bank, they sold it in 2014 for $3.4 billion to CIT Group Inc for $3.4 billion. ",politicsNews,"November 15, 2016 ",0
 Former EPA Head FINALLY Admits She Was Wrong About Ground Zero Air Quality,"On the day before the 15th anniversary of September 11, the former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Republican Christie Todd Whitman, has finally admitted she was wrong about the air quality at Ground Zero.In the days following the crippling attack, Whitman reassured first responders and those cleaning up the wreckage that the public air quality was safe to breathe:I am glad to reassure the people of New York   that their air is safe to breathe and their water is safe to drinkAs thousands of Americans suffer debilitating illness   and death   due to the toxicity of the, Whitman remained silent for years. Until now. Speaking to the Guardian, Whitman expressed immense guilt and regret for staying silent, and told the paper she still  feels awful  at the events that transpired:Whatever we got wrong, we should acknowledge and people should be helped. I m very sorry that people are sick,  she said.  I m very sorry that people are dying and if the EPA and I in any way contributed to that, I m sorry. We did the very best we could at the time with the knowledge we had. Every time it comes around to the anniversary I cringe, because I know people will bring up my name, they blame me, they say that I lied and that people died because I lied, [they say] people have died because I made a mistake.No doubt that Whitman feels ashamed. No doubt she is riddled with regret and guilt. But after 15 years she final decides to speak? After more than 1,100 people have been diagnosed with cancer related to the effects of Ground Zero   and nearly 900 first responders have died as of June 2009  the apology comes a little too late.The effects of Ground Zero have been know for years and years. Republicans have played politics with healthcare, and like Whitman, have not taken responsibility for their actions.As early as 2003, the Inspector General criticized the EPA s handling of the situation, and still no accountability or responsibility was taken. Whitman did resign, but contends it had nothing to do with the Inspector General s findings and instead stems from personal decisions after disagreements with Vice President Dick Cheney. Whitman had an opportunity to take responsibility, but chose not to.Republicans criticize Obama s response to Ebola, Zika, H1-N1, but look over Whitman and th Bush Administration s shameful ignorance ad deflection of the Ground Zero cancer cases.An apology fifteen years too late, but better late than never I suppose.Featured image via Aaron Davidson/Getty Images",News,"September 11, 2016",1

The legislator in the disturbing dash-cam video is Jennifer Schwartz Berky, a member of the Ulster County Legislature in Ulster County, New York.Becky obviously doesn t think the rules apply to her The incident occurred back in May. The video is coming out now   just in time for local elections   in response to a Freedom of Information Law request (and in spite of appeals by Berky s lawyer to suppress it).You owe it to yourself to watch this woman s epic freakout.

 CNN Panelist LAUGHS In Corey Lewandowski’s Face After Hearing New Trump Victory Plan (VIDEO),"As Donald Trump s campaign continues to sink deeper into its self-sabotaging downward spiral, it s becoming clear that even Trump s campaign surrogates and former staffers are having trouble trying to stay positive about the outcome of this election. In just the past few days, we ve seen them completely deny that Trump s campaign made some massive changes in desperation, ignore polls that The Donald is losing and now thanks to former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, they re holding onto false hope that Trump can still somehow win this.Earlier today on CNN, Lewandowski   who is forbidden by contract to say anything negative about Trump   tried to convince everyone that Trump was still on track to win this election because his biggest opponent, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, was losing voters to Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson. Lewandowski said: This is not a two-person race. Gary Johnson and Jill Stein are in this race. I would say Jill Stein should be in the debates. She s a person who is going to take away votes from Hillary Clinton. You just had her here on the show  At the end of the day, Donald Trump is going to win this election, he s going to win in states because Gary Johnson and Jill Stein are going to take votes away from Hillary Clinton. While Lewandowski clung to his delusions, CNN panelist Bill Kristol was sitting right beside him, shaking his head while smiling and muffling his laughter. When Kristol could finally get enough control over himself to speak, he dropped a major truth bomb that Lewandowski and Trump weren t going to like: That s the last recourse of a campaign that s going to lose. It s hoping third-and-fourth-party candidates are going to magically change the equation. At the end of the day, 38% of the American people think Donald Trump should be president, it s never gotten much above that number.

#SanBernardino Terror Attack May Have Been Prevented If Neighbors Weren’t Afraid Of Being Accused Of “Profiling” [VIDEO],"Political correctness is literally killing America  Authorities on Wednesday night continued to investigate a Redlands home tied to Syed Farook, a suspect identified in connection with the mass shootings that killed at least 14 people and injured at least 17 people at a social services center in San Bernardino on Wednesday morning.A few hours after the mass shooting, authorities followed a tip to the home on Center Street in Redlands. As officers approached, the suspects fled in a dark SUV. A police pursuit ensued, ending back in San Bernardino, where a gun battle broke out.Two suspects   one male and one female   were killed in the shootout, Burguan said. He said both suspects were armed with assault rifles and handguns. A third person who fled from the shooting scene was detained after an extensive search. It was not immediately clear if that person was involved in the Inland Regional Center shooting.One police officer was wounded in the shooting, apparently from a ricochet, but was not seriously injured.As darkness fell, police continued to search the home in Redlands. Officers entered the home with a battering ram and were taking precautions due to a belief that the home could be rigged with explosives.It was believed that the Redlands home was the home of Syed Farook s sister and mother.The second shooting suspect who was killed in a shootout with authorities was identified as Farook s wife of two years, Tashfeen Malik, 27.Neighbors in Redlands were shocked that the suspects had ties to their area. I was in awe that it was happening four houses down from my property,  one neighbor said.A man who has been working in the area said he noticed a half-dozen Middle Eastern men in the area in recent weeks, but decided not to report anything since he did not wish to racially profile those people.

"Suspected of graft, Indonesian parliament speaker under guard in hospital","JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian anti-graft investigators have put the speaker of parliament, who they have identified as a suspect in a $170 million corruption case, under armed guard in hospital after he was involved in a car accident, his lawyer said on Friday. Officers from the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) tried to arrest Setya Novanto, the chairman of Golkar, Indonesia s second-largest party and partner in the ruling coalition, at his house in Jakarta late on Wednesday. But the investigators, watched by television cameras, failed to find him, sparking speculation that he had gone into hiding. The KPK is investigating state losses amounting to about $170 million linked to a national electronic identity card scheme after allegations that sums ranging from $5,000 to $5.5 million - generated by marking up procurement costs - were divided up among politicians in parliament. Novanto was named a suspect in the case again last week after he had used a controversial legal maneuver, a pre-trial motion, to get earlier charges dropped last month. He has denied wrongdoing but has repeatedly missed summonses from the KPK for questioning in recent months, saying he was ill and needed to undergo heart surgery. Late on Thursday, reports emerged that Novanto was involved in a car accident while on his way to turn himself in at KPK headquarters. Novanto s lawyer, Fredrich Yunadi, said a journalist was driving the vehicle and interviewing his client at the time of the accident.  (The driver) was looking back and looking to the side, so he wasn t concentrating on what was in front of him,  Yunadi  said. Novanto was now  very ill  with head and hand injuries, Yunadi said.  He can t even get up yet. He can t talk yet, it s just his eyes   when he opens his eyes the ceiling swirls in circles.  The lawyer said armed KPK officers were guarding Novanto and had ignored requests to leave.   Novanto was taken to a second hospital on Friday for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, media reported. Novanto gained a measure of international fame in September 2015 when then U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump hailed the Indonesian politician as a  great man  during a news conference.   Do they like me in Indonesia?  Trump asked after introducing Novanto to reporters at Trump Tower.   Yes, highly,  Novanto replied. Indonesian newspapers splashed pictures across their front pages of a black sport utility vehicle that Novanto was said to have been traveling in.  It was resting against an electricity pole, and appeared to have suffered only minor damage to the front fender. Febri Diansyah, a KPK spokesman, said on Thursday the crash happened shortly after the agency had asked the national police chief and Interpol to place Novanto on a wanted list.   The KPK would liaise with doctors to see if Novanto was  fit to stand trial  and would continue its investigation, Febri told Inews TV. Yunadi has said a request for another pre-trial motion had been filed on behalf of his client.  President Joko Widodo on Friday urged Novanto, a political ally, to  follow the legal process . Previously, Widodo has backed the KPK against efforts by some members of parliament to weaken the independent agency s powers.  Vice President Jusuf Kalla, who is also a Golkar member, told reporters on Thursday Novanto should be ready to face any legal process if called upon. Indonesians widely perceive parliament as one of their country s most corrupt institutions, Transparency International says. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",0

SCAM ALERT! USDA GIVES OBAMABUCKS TO FARMERS FOR GREEN ENERGY “PROJECTS”,"The USDA is spreading the wealth like crazy with the green energy giveaways of thousands to farmers. We know from past experience that these farmers are given grants and loans for supposed green energy  projects  only to see the scam of pocketing money. The USDA had previously spend BILLIONS of taxpayer dollars on a project called Pigford that was proven to be nothing but an effort to redistribute money to thousands of minorities. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is spending millions on green energy projects for farms, including putting solar panels on the tops of chicken coops.The federal agency announced Friday that its Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) will spend $63 million on solar panels and wind turbines for the farming industry.One project, totaling $16,094, was awarded to Blue Sky Poultry, Inc., of Bainbridge, Ga., to  install a solar array on the roof of poultry houses. Other projects announced by the USDA included $18,000 for solar panels for a fruit farm in Ohio, and $19,750 for a wind turbine for a farm in Minnesota.The majority of funding is going toward similar small projects. The agency is also financing larger solar projects through loan guarantees in the amounts of $3 to $4 million, and funding a $5 million project to turn wood into gas.Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said the $63 million in funding would  create jobs, reduce greenhouse gas pollution, and helps usher in a more secure energy future for the nation. The USDA pointed out that the Obama administration has spent more than $291 million in grants and $327 million in loan guarantees on green energy projects for farmers through the program since the president took office.Via: WFB",Government News,"Aug 10, 2015",1
OBAMA THREATENS TO SURFACE FROM LEFTIST BUNKER To Speak Out Against Trump’s Plan To End DACA,"Contrary to what the media would like us to believe, Obama has not remained silent when it comes to policy that President Trump put in place by executive order. Neither he nor his Democratic henchmen remained silent when President Trump desperately tried to convince Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare, or when he had the opportunity to attack him over his handling of the Charlottesville controversy. The media celebrated Obama s post-Charlotseville tweet designed to make our former President look like he was in favor of uniting the nation (which we all know is a bald-faced lie), while falsely giving the impression that President Trump was choosing sides.Before the media gets into a full-blown tizzy about Obama using social media to bash our current president over DACA, they might consider that most of America aren t stupid enough to believe that Valerie Jarrett didn t move into Barack Obama s DC home because he needed a friend to play checkers with. He may not be making public statements to voice his opposition against our current president, but one thing we do know is that he and Valerie Jarrett aren t sitting on their hands, while President Trump unwinds everything they worked so hard to make happen, including DACA.Hotair   You know it s killing this guy not to be on camera every day scolding Trump in his usual  that s not who we are  terms but that would be a strategic disaster so obvious that silence is really the only option. A  Trump vs. Obama  fight over almost any issue would unify most of the right behind the president and O knows it; the most brutal thing he can do to Trump is to deny him that our-guy-versus-their-guy dynamic. I don t think it s crazy to believe that Trump s job approval would be five to 10 points higher if Obama had spent the last seven months sniping at him regularly. By withholding his criticism, he s made it possible for  soft  Republicans and right-leaning independents to criticize POTUS without fear of being accused that they re carrying O s water.Two days before President Trump s inauguration, Obama warned him that he would come out against him if Trump rescinded his unconstitutional DACA.Why attack Trump now? I think there s more to it than DACA just being near and dear to Obama s heart. He knows that congressional Republicans are going to be jammed up here to an unusual degree. Immigration is a fraught issue for the GOP under the best of circumstances but DREAMers are an especially hard case due to their having come here as children. They re the one class of illegals about whom even Trump speaks warmly. In fact, the president s going to end DACA not because he wants to but because Republican AGs are squeezing him to do so, replete with the threat of a court battle; even then, Trump is still so reluctant to pull the plug that he s willing to hold off for another six months. The entire GOP (apart from Steve King) will spend those six months telling every voter who listens that they re open to legalizing DREAMers. All they ask in return is some face-saving security measures so that they can semi-plausibly argue to their base that they didn t roll over completely on amnesty.Having Obama wade in publicly on the side of DREAMers will complicate all of that. With O banging the drum for amnesty, Republican voters who are lukewarm on the idea in the first place will start to turn frosty. Populists will have a field day attacking Ryan and McConnell (and Trump?) for essentially doing Obama s bidding by negotiating for a DREAM bill. Some congressional Republicans might start to get cold feet. The more hostile Trump and the congressional GOP become towards a DREAM deal as part of a backlash towards Obama, the more ammo Schumer will have to say that Republicans are being cruel to poor illegal children whose only mistake was trusting the federal government. The whole GOP  we like DREAMers too!  messaging effort will be scrambled. Either negotiations will end up collapsing in Congress, with Dems using the DREAM failure against Republicans next fall, or Trump, Ryan, and McConnell will have to swallow hard and approve an amnesty cheered on by Barack farking Obama, which is about the RINO-iest move a modern Republican is capable of making. Either the GOP base ends up angry at the White House or everyone else does.

"Missouri lawmakers override gun, voter ID vetoes","KANSAS CITY, Mo. (Reuters) - Missouri lawmakers pushed through bills on Wednesday eliminating the need for permits to carry concealed weapons and requiring voters to show a photo identification before casting a ballot, overriding Democratic Governor Jay Nixon’s vetoes of the bills. Both votes by the Republican-controlled state House and Senate reached the two-thirds majority required to enact legislation over the governor’s veto. The weapons bill abolished a state law requiring a permit, training and background checks for people who want to carry a concealed weapon in the state.  The House voted 112-41 to override Nixon’s veto and the Senate voted 24-6. Supporters of the bill said it will make the state safer by allowing more residents to carry firearms in self-defense, while still banning certain criminals and mentally incompetent people from having a gun. In vetoing the bill in July, Nixon said the measure struck an extreme blow to sensible safeguards against gun violence. Earlier on Wednesday, the state Senate voted 24-7 and the House 115-41 to override Nixon’s veto of a bill requiring voters to produce a government-issued ID instead of less official identification such as a utility bill or bank check. The bill would not take effect until 2017, after this year’s presidential election, and only if voters in November pass a state constitutional amendment in support of the new law. That is necessary because the Missouri Supreme Court ruled 10 years ago that such a statute violated the existing state constitution. Courts in recent months have blocked voter ID laws passed in several states by Republican-led legislatures after civil rights groups argued the measures were discriminatory against poor and minority voters. In Missouri, voters without a photo ID can still vote if they sign an affidavit swearing that they lack any type of identification. However, election officials can take their picture, and steps must be taken to get a photo ID for later use, with the state covering the cost. Supporters of the bill said it will help prevent voter fraud. “Why not have more certainty in the election process?” Republican Representative Justin Alferman, the bill’s main sponsor, said in a statement before the vote. Opponents had argued that the ID requirement places an undue burden on young, minority and low-income voters who tend to support Democratic candidates. “Putting additional and unwanted barriers between citizens and their ability to vote is wrong and detrimental to our system of government as a whole,” Nixon said in explaining his veto.

German minister warns on Washington trip against 'politics of fear',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Germany’s foreign minister warned during a trip to Washington on Tuesday about a rise in the use of populist fear tactics by politicians on both sides of the Atlantic, describing this as a threat to Europe, the United States and transatlantic relations. Speaking at George Washington University on Super Tuesday, the biggest single day of state-by-state presidential nominating contests, Frank-Walter Steinmeier did not refer to Donald Trump or other candidates by name but he said he was concerned about the tone of the U.S. campaign. “In Germany and in Europe, something is gaining momentum in our domestic politics - and to be honest, I am also seeing it here in the United States during the primary campaigns. It’s the politics of fear,” Steinmeier said. Politicians in Germany and elsewhere in Europe have watched nervously as businessman and reality TV star Trump has moved from a long shot to the front-runner among Republicans seeking the party’s nomination to run in the Nov. 8 general election. Trump has described Chancellor Angela Merkel’s welcoming policy towards refugees as “insane” and predicted it would cause rioting in Germany. He has also praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been at odds with Europe since Moscow’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region two years ago. Germany does not face a federal election until next year. But a new anti-immigrant party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), has emerged as a threat to Merkel’s conservatives. The AfD wants Germany to shut its border to migrants and use force to repel them if necessary. “They pretend that we can seal ourselves off and leave the world outside to deal with its own problems. But that’s wrong,” Steinmeier said, referring to politicians in Europe and the United States. “The worst thing we could do is seal ourselves off,” he said. In a subtle dig at Trump, who has promised to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and make the Mexicans pay for it, the German foreign minister added: “So if you ask me: building walls is a very bad idea - no matter who pays for them.” ",politicsNews,"March 1, 2016 ",0

Conservative, liberal or otherwise,  he said during an interview while explaining away Trump banning media from events,  that s what makes a democracy a democracy versus a dictatorship. I think there is a vastly different model when it comes to government and what should be expected, and that s on both sides. I think we have a respect for the press when it comes to the government. That is something you can t ban an entity from,  Spicer said. But now the Trump administration is banning media from government functions. . Senior White House policy adviser Stephen Miller made it clear that Trump s actions are absolute and  will not be questioned  after judges killed The Donald s Muslim ban. That paints a pretty clear picture of how the Trump administration views themselves   as dictators.It is up to the American people to stop them.Featured image via Getty Images(Mario Tama)/screengrab",News,"February 26, 2017",1
Byrne: health bill prospects hurt as many Republicans left out of talks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Bradley Byrne said on Thursday the White House’s attention to conservative House Freedom Caucus members could hurt the healthcare bill’s prospects and warned that it faces diminishing odds if a vote is not held this week. “The vast majority of us in the Republican conference have been left out of these discussions,” Bradley said. “And we have no idea what’s going on.

 FBI Warns Republicans: Do Not Leak Clinton Email Files,"It s no secret Republicans are salivating to find something, anything, to take down Hillary Clinton. The idea of a third term for Democrats (at the hands of an accomplished woman) scares the hell out of them. So they do what they do best: lie, cheat, smear and bog down with endless investigations.Now that the FBI and the Department of Justice have cleared Clinton of any criminal wrongdoing, Republicans are once again faced with nowhere to go. They have hit a wall when it comes to pinning criminal charges on Clinton, who is increasing her chances of becoming America s next president.As part of a usual maneuver of transparency, the FBI handed over to members of Congress documents detailing  witness interview reports, including that of Secretary Clinton s interview, along with other materials from the FBI s now closed investigative file  in regards to her email controversy.In the age of the internet, it is almost guaranteed that whenever Congress gets their hands on anything potentially incriminating, embarrassing or politically expedient, it s leaked to the public. Both sides do it for different reasons, some for nefarious reasons, and others as a public service.But this situation is different. Republicans are hoping to use evidence in these documents as a  smoking gun  for the court of public opinion since their desire for indictment in a court of law fell flat. But there s one harbinger to this: many of these documents are deemed classified and confidential. And should any Republican, at the behest of their staff or them personally, feel compelled to leak the information provided, the FBI released a statement reminding them of what they are messing with:Consistent with our commitment to transparency with respect to the FBI s investigation to former Secretary of State Clinton s use of a personal server, the FBI is providing certain relevant materials to appropriate congressional committees assist them in their oversight responsibilities in this matter. The material contains classified and other sensitive information and is being provided with the expectation it will not be disseminated or disclosed without FBI concurrence.Should someone from Capitol Hill leak the information, prosecution could be pursued. And should a Republican be stupid enough to allow such a leak, their moral high ground argument that Clinton was reckless with handling classified information would be completely and utterly decimated.While Republicans are hoping to be selective in their  discoveries,  the Clinton campaign has announced that they want all the documents pertaining to the investigation to be released, as to stave off biased selection of information at the hands of a bloodthirsty GOP:This is an extraordinarily rare step that was sought solely by Republicans for the purposes of further second-guessing the career professionals at the FBI. We believe that if these materials are going to be shared outside the Justice Department, they should be released widely so that the public can see them for themselves, rather than allow Republicans to mischaracterize them through selective, partisan leaks.While Trump continues to put off releasing his much anticipated tax returns, the Clinton campaign is calling for near-total transparency of the facts surrounding what is arguably the dumbest  scandal  she has been linked to.Be careful Republicans. Everything you ve worked for could come crashing down should a giddy staffer decide to be a  conservative hero  and leak information.Featured image via Mark Mekela/Getty Images",News,"August 18, 2016",1
"Spreading housing shortage hits over 850,000 people in Germany: report","BERLIN (Reuters) - A housing crisis is spreading in Germany, the Federal Homelessness Association said on Tuesday, forecasting that 1.2 million people could be living in shelters by 2018. The report came amid heightened concern about Germany s rising poverty rate and ability to integrate 1.1 million migrants that have arrived over the past two years, drawn by the country s reputation for affluence, efficiency and stability. The homelessness association said that more than 850,000 people lacked their own accommodation in 2016, up 150 percent from 2014, and half of those affected were migrants.  A total of 52,000 people were living on the streets in 2016, up a third from 2014, the group said in its report. It added that the number of those living in shelters would likely rise by another 40 percent by 2018, driven higher by rising rents, decreasing availability of subsidized housing, and the growing numbers of refugees granted asylum status and therefore entitled to housing. The homelessness association said immigration was a factor behind the rising rate of housing shortage, but also blamed what it called  failed  housing policies.  The main cause of housing shortages and homelessness is a housing policy that has failed in Germany for decades, as well as insufficient efforts to fight poverty,  Thomas Specht, director of the association, said in a statement. Almost 20 percent of Germany s population, or 16 million people, were at risk of poverty in 2016, the Federal Statistics Office reported last week. Germany s Labour and Social Affairs Ministry defended its handling of refugee housing needs, noting that finding individual housing around the country remained a challenge.   It should not be forgotten that the swift accommodation of hundreds of thousands of refugees in adequate collective housing in 2015 and 2016 was an extraordinary achievement,  the ministry spokesman said on Tuesday. Would-be partners in a new German government coalition remain at odds over a limit on migration. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",0
 Gingrich Seriously Thinks Trump Could Get More Black Votes ‘Than Any Republican In Modern Times’,"Former House Speaker and Trump supporter Newt Gingrich has gone completely delusional, having somehow convinced himself that Donald Trump could somehow manage to get more of the Africa American vote  than any Republican in modern times. (Go ahead and laugh, I ll wait.) Donald Trump is the first Republican I can remember who is explicitly saying to the African-American community,  Things can be better, but not with Democrats in charge,'  Gingrich said during an interview with Fox News. If [Trump] continues to say it, and if he has the courage to go back to places like Chicago and say it, I think he s going get far more votes from the black community than any Republican in modern times. The GOP nominee has kicked off  minority outreach  efforts in recent weeks, but by all accounts, this has done him little if any favors. Trump s grand scheme so far has been to say that people of color should vote for him because their lives suck so bad that they don t really have anything to lose anyway, so why not give him a shot and see what happens. Mind you, he has primarily said this to predominately white crowds, which has also drawn criticism.On Saturday, Trump attended a service at a black church in Detroit, which turned out to be as much of a failure as the rest of his attempts to pander to African Americans. The bigoted billionaire s speech was carefully scripted, but judging by the empty church, nobody really wanted to hear his schpeel anyway. However, looking at how many protesters turned out for the event, it is pretty clear that nobody is buying his latest line of bullsh*t.Watch Gingrich lose all touch with reality, here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZK_mNHZqZU]Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 3, 2016",1
WATCH: INTERNATIONAL SHOPLIFTING PUNK LiAngelo Ball Makes Disgusting Admission About His Apology To President Trump…Proves He’s No Better Than His Ungrateful Dad,"It s beyond sad to watch these young men sitting through an interview with their overbearing, loudmouth dad controlling their every move. It s especially disturbing to see Lavar Ball and the hosts of The Breakfast Club laughing about LiAngelo and his fellow UCLA basketball players stealing Louis Vuitton sunglasses in China.He certainly isn t doing them any favors LiAngelo Ball said he wouldn t have apologized to President Trump if UCLA didn t make him do so.After Ball and teammates Cody Riley and Jalen Hill were arrested and released for shoplifting in China, the trio held a press conference after arriving in the United States where they thanked Trump for his role in their release. But according to LiAngelo, who along with his dad, LaVar, spoke about the apology with The Breakfast Club Wednesday morning, an apology wouldn t have been in the cards if he knew he wasn t going to play for UCLA again.Watch, as Lavar Ball, the father of 2 of these 3 unfortunate young men that were part of the interview with The Breakfast Club, talks about how differently he d be treated if he were white. Perhaps someone should explain to Lavar that the real reason he offends everyone within earshot of his big mouth, is because he s an arrogant ass, who owes any attention he gets from the media to his son s athletic abilities (which of course, he takes full credit for). They wanted to hear that, and he tweeted about it before my speech so I had to add it in there right before I gave it,  LiAngelo told the Power 105.1 morning show.According to the middle Ball son, the school reminded him about Trump right before he went up to speak to the press. If they didn t tell me to do it, it wouldn t have been in there,  Ball said on the program, in reference to the Trump apology.Trump fired off a tweet after the UCLA players returned questioning whether they would thank him for facilitating their release.Trump s tweet then prompted LaVar Ball to question how exactly Trump helped. Who?  Ball told ESPN.  What was he over there for? Don t tell me nothing. Everybody wants to make it seem like he helped me out. Ball s response led to more beef between the two, with Ball reigniting the feud earlier in December when he tweeted a cartoon showing him dunking on the commander-in-chief.LiAngelo, who was suspended indefinitely by UCLA, left the school weeks later and, along with his younger brother, LaMelo, signed a professional contract with Lithuania basketball club Prienu Vytautas this week.  NYPOn November 21, 2017, we published an article about how a family member revealed the SICK reason LaVar Ball allegedly wouldn t let his sons see their mother after  surgery to remove portion of her skull So who is this crackpot LaVar Ball, and why would anyone in their right mind make such arrogant and ignorant remarks after the President of the United States just helped their son to escape a prison sentence in a foreign country? Andrew Stephens of the Armchair All Americans did a pretty good job of summing up what a horrible human being the self-serving, money, and fame-obsessed LaVar Ball really is. In his article, Stephens reveals a sick man, who is so controlling of his 3 sons and their basketball careers, that he wouldn t even let them visit their very sick mother in the hospital, over fears that it could create media attention that could damage his merchandise brand.On March 15, 2017, Andrew Stephens of Armchair All Americans published an article about Lavar Ball titled Lavar Ball: The epitome of what is wrong with modern sports. It touched on helicopter parenting and the monetization of potentially profitable children.Stephens claimed that in the article, without commenting on upbringing tactics, I attempted to delve into Lavar Ball s seemingly unnecessary promotion of his own sons for his personal benefit.About an hour after the article was run, I received a comment on it from a member of the Ball family, who wishes to remain anonymous. The comment (which has since been removed to protect the email address and identity of the commenter) read as follows:- Wow. You nailed it. Although you don t even know the half of it. Lavar took over the high school program, added the Coach, his puppet (which is why he quit last year after becoming the national coach of the year) and Lavar stepped on and crushed countless other kids  careers and love for the game to get his kids on the court. If you are allowed to shoot at any time from anywhere and never come out of the game, any decent idiot could score 30 points.Also, Tina Ball, his wife had a stroke on Feb 21. She had life-threatening skull surgery to relieve brain pressure   guess where Lavar was during the operation that could have killed his wife?   at the CHHS vs. LB Poly game with his sons, including Lonzo. He still has not allowed his kids to see their sick mother due to the media attention it would bring to him, and cause BBB sales to diminish. [Name of hospital] in [City of hospital], CA   Tina is there now and he only visits for 1 hour a few days a week, while her Mother has yet to leave her side. Pathetic!!! ",politics,"Dec 13, 2017",1
Franken and Franks resign as misconduct charges batter Congress,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic Senator Al Franken announced his resignation on Thursday after facing a series of sexual misconduct allegations, and Republican Representative Trent Franks also said he was stepping down as he too was hit with ethics charges.  Franken, buffeted for weeks by sexual harassment charges and under pressure from party colleagues, said on the Senate floor he would leave in a few weeks, although he denied some of the allegations against him and questioned others. The 66-year-old former comedian from Minnesota had been seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party. “I know in my heart that nothing I’ve done as a senator - nothing - has brought dishonor on this institution,” he said. “Nevertheless, today I am announcing that in the coming weeks, I will be resigning as a member of the United States Senate.” Hours later, Franks announced his resignation after two former staff members complained about discussions he had with them about his efforts to find a surrogate mother. “I deeply regret that my discussion of this option and process in the workplace caused distress,” said Franks, who was first elected to his Arizona congressional seat in 2002 and is an outspoken opponent of abortion.  Franks said in a statement that he and his wife “have long struggled with infertility.” The developments came with Congress already held in low regard by voters. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, only 20 percent approved of the way Congress was handling its job, with 70 percent disapproving. In recent weeks, charges of sexual misconduct have taken down prominent people in the worlds of entertainment, media and politics. It is somewhat rare for members of the Senate or House of Representatives to resign from office, but veteran Democratic Representative John Conyers also resigned earlier this week amid sexual harassment accusations that he has denied. The House Ethics Committee said on Thursday it was investigating yet another lawmaker. Blake Farenthold, a Republican representative from Texas, faces allegations of sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation involving a former female staff member. Franken has the highest profile of the lawmakers hit by allegations in the past few weeks.  Reuters has not independently verified the accusations against Franken, Franks, Conyers or Farenthold. Franken’s seat will initially be filled by a Democrat appointed by Minnesota’s Democratic governor, meaning the  Republicans’ slim majority in the Senate will not change. Allegations that Franken had groped and tried to kiss women without their consent began to surface three weeks ago. He initially said he was embarrassed and ashamed by his behavior but would not resign.  But the majority of his Democratic colleagues in the Senate called on Wednesday for his resignation after a new allegation, denied by Franken, hit the news.  “Some of the allegations against me are simply not true. Others I remember very differently,” Franken said on Thursday.  Striking a tone of defiance, he also sought to contrast himself with two prominent Republicans - President Donald Trump and Senate candidate Roy Moore. “I, of all people, am aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate, with the full support of his party,” he said. Trump was heard bragging about kissing and forcibly touching women in a 2005 videotape that surfaced last year as he was running for the White House. He apologized for the remarks, but called them private “locker-room talk” and said he had not done the things he talked about.  Trump also denied allegations at that time by at least 12 women of sexual advances and groping in the past. Moore, who is running for the Senate in Alabama in a special election on Tuesday, has been accused by several women of sexual assault or misconduct when they were teenagers and Moore was in his early 30s. Moore, 70, has denied the accusations, which Reuters has not independently verified. Trump has backed Moore, but Senate Republicans have been cooler toward his candidacy. In pressing Franken to step aside, Democrats have tried to capture the moral high ground and draw a distinction between their party and Republicans.         “In every workplace in America, including the U.S. Senate, we must confront the challenges of harassment and misconduct,” said Amy Klobuchar, Franken’s fellow Democratic senator from Minnesota.     Similarly, House Republican Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday he had told Franks that he should resign. A special election will be scheduled to determine a replacement for Franks. While a Democrat will be appointed initially to replace Franken, his departure could complicate the party’s efforts to maintain or build on the 46 Senate seats they hold. Two independent senators also vote with the Democrats. Republicans are defending eight seats in the congressional elections in November 2018 but Democrats will be defending 26 if Minnesota holds a special election for Franken’s seat. The election to fill Franken’s seat could be close. When he ran in 2008, the race was decided after an extensive recount, with Minnesota’s Supreme Court weighing in.  In the 2016 presidential election, Democrat Hillary Clinton won the state by less than 2 percentage points. ",politicsNews,"December 7, 2017 ",0
Egypt-Gaza border opens under PA control for first time in a decade,"GAZA (Reuters) - The Egypt-Gaza border opened under control of the Western-backed Palestinian Authority for the first time since 2007 on Saturday, raising residents  hopes for easier passage in and out of the impoverished enclave. An Egyptian-brokered reconciliation deal last month formally restored Palestinian President Abbas s administrative control of Gaza, including its border crossings with Israel and Egypt, after a 10-year schism with Islamist Hamas. Palestinians hope the pact will ease Gaza s economic woes and help them present a united front in their drive for statehood, although the details of implementation of the deal have yet to be worked out fully. Citing security concerns, Egypt and Israel maintain tight restrictions at their Gaza borders. Hamas, regarded by the West as a terrorist group, seized the enclave in 2007 after fighting forces loyal to Abbas. Hamas quit positions at three Gaza crossings and handed them over to Palestinian Authority employees on Nov. 1, in a step seen as vital to encouraging Israel and Egypt to ease their restrictions on the movement of goods and people. Witnesses said at least five buses loaded with passengers crossed over to the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing on Saturday. Hamas-appointed policemen had checked travellers  documents in a separate hall outside Rafah.  Egypt has not yet signaled any change to its present policy under which it opens the border crossing three times a week. Palestinians are hoping the crossing will operate full-time, as it had been doing until 2007. About 30,000 Gazans have applied for entry to Egypt in the past few months, according to the Palestinian Interior Ministry. Egypt will host further talks with Hamas, Fatah and other factions next week on Nov. 21 to discuss major reconciliation issues, including security arrangements and a possible date for Palestinian presidential and parliamentary elections. Responsibility for security remains an open issue in Gaza, where Hamas, which still polices the territory, has what analysts say are at least 25,000 well-equipped fighters. The group refuses to disarm, as demanded by Israel and the United States. ",worldnews,"November 18, 2017 ",0
Trump asks for probe into imports of foreign-made steel: officials,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday will sign a directive asking for a speedy probe into whether imports of foreign-made steel are hurting U.S. national security, two administration officials said on Wednesday. Trump is to sign the memorandum related to section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 at a White House event that is expected to include leaders of some U.S. steel companies. The law allows the president to impose restrictions on imports for reasons of national security. There are national security implications, one of the officials said, from imports of steel alloys that are used in products such as the armor plating of ships and require a lot of expertise to create and produce. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross launched the probe on Wednesday night. Trump’s directive will ask Ross to conduct it “with all deliberate speed and deliver the results to the president with his recommendations,” a second official said. The move is another step in Trump’s “America First” policies in which he has tried to boost U.S. manufacturers and preserve American jobs. It comes as he tries to coax China into taking a more active role in reining in North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. The first official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the directive is not aimed at a specific country but is “product oriented.” He said there is concern when a domestic industry is hurt by imports from a foreign entity “that hampers our ability to maintain production and maintain the expertise necessary for these high national security-concerned products, specific alloys and so forth.” ",politicsNews,"April 20, 2017 ",0

As a matter of fact, when they were asked if they planned on removing Bill Cosby s star, President Leron Gubler said: The answer is no. Once a star has been added to the Walk, it is considered a part of the historic fabric of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Trump is an absolutely vile human being. He has made a name for himself in politics on the backs of others. He incites violence, treats women like garbage, promotes xenophobic and Islamophobic hate and feels no remorse for any of it. While I understand that the Chamber of Commerce s point of view, I disagree with it.  Hopefully, the rumors are true and the Hollywood Trust is actually considering the possibility of removing it and can put pressure on the Chamber.

MUSLIM CONGRESSMAN Abruptly Leaves DC: Uses Finely Honed Divisive Race Skills To Lead Fight Against Cops In MN,"Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) is more than just a radical activist, he s also a devout Muslim U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison abruptly left Washington earlier this month to fly back to Minneapolis and emerged at the center of explosive confrontations between black activists and police outside the Fourth Precinct station.In those first, uncertain days after a fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man in north Minneapolis, Ellison displayed credibility among different factions of the black community, and also had stature in the mayor s office and could help broker a sit-down meeting between Gov. Mark Dayton and the family of the shooting victim, Jamar Clark.The unrest has elevated Ellison s profile, but it has also become his biggest test yet as a political leader trying to negotiate a truce in the latest flare-up of long-running tensions between police and the local black community. People have successfully gotten the attention of political leadership,  Ellison said from the protest site, less than a mile from his home.  We just have to make sure we do not waste it, and we make sure we gather it up and turn it into some tangible benefits for the people here. Striking a tone that was conciliatory but also challenging, he added:  There s absolutely no doubt that we have to get established, responsive government. The unrest hit uncomfortably close to home for the fifth-term Democrat just a few days after the shooting. During a particularly fraught night, his son, Jeremiah, was photographed with his hands up as police in riot gear pointed a gun toward him and other protesters. Ellison later shared the photo on his Twitter account, calling it  agonizing.  It was retweeted nearly 4,000 times.Behind the scenes, Ellison, 52, has been navigating several constituencies, including the governor s office, city officials, progressive allies and black activists who themselves are split over how to best accomplish their goals. Some black community members say they hope the shooting will finally get the attention of state leaders, whom they say have allowed Minnesota s racial disparities to fester for decades.Those connected to Ellison say his latest role is one that he has honed after years of deep involvement in divisive racial issues around Minneapolis. They say he radiates a cool confidence in person, and is enormously skilled at connecting with people in the midst of conflicts. People who don t know him, especially from outside of Minneapolis, see a firebrand out in the streets, playing that one really important role he plays, rallying the community to be empowered,  former Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak said.  The other role that most people don t see, that I have the benefit of, is a very savvy adviser who would never moderate his views but would bring a sophisticated understanding of how government worked.   For entire story: Star TribuneSo who exactly is Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) and why do Muslim lawmakers like hime and Andre Carson (D-IN) in America matter?Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) is perhaps the most well known Muslim in the U.S. Congress but he s not the only one. The other is Rep. Andre Carson (D-IN). While speaking at the ICNA-MAS convention, Carson told those in attendance that America s schools should be  modeled  after  madrassas  (Islamic schools).Incidentally, the ICNA (Islamic Circle of North America) was identified in a 1991 Muslim Brotherhood document as one of 29  like minded  organizations. The goal of these organizations? According to the document itself: their work in America is a kind of grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and  sabotaging  its miserable house by their hands   so that   God s religion [Islam] is made victorious over all other religions. MAS (Muslim American Society) was formed in 1992, one year after the date of the document, which might explain why they weren t one of the 29. Bolstering that case further is the fact that MAS has identified two groups who are on the list of the notorious 29   Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) and Muslim Students Association (MSA) as being like-minded.So, as DHS is more concerned with  rightwing extremism  than it is with Jihad, a sitting U.S. Congressman is a featured speaker at a convention filled with those who want to destroy Western civilization (America) from within.

CNN INTERVIEW TURNS INTO SCREAMING MATCH When Activist Director Argues New “IRRELEVANT” Footage Of Michael Brown Is Game Changer [VIDEO],"(From CNN) New video captured hours before Michael Brown was killed shows the 18-year-old exchanging marijuana for cigarillos with the clerks of a Ferguson, Missouri, store, a documentary director told CNN on Monday.Director Jason Pollock, whose film  Stranger Fruit  debuted at the South by Southwest festival in Austin over the weekend, said the video shows that Brown did not rob the store before being stopped by police and that surveillance footage purporting to show Brown engaged in a robbery at the Ferguson Market and Liquor stores was actually video of Brown returning to the store to retrieve the cigarillos the clerks gave him. This is a shady store. We ve asked a lot of people in this community. You can buy weed at the store,  Pollock said. Pollock suggests that had this footage been released, it would ve altered the notion that Brown was shot after robbing the store. He learned of the footage from a St. Louis County police report that mentioned a video from 1:13 a.m. the day of Brown s death.In an earlier interview, in which he appeared alongside Brown s father, Pollock said,  What this video shows is that (police) lied to the world about what happened. They wanted to make Mike look bad, so they put out half a video to destroy his character in his death. Police say the new footage is irrelevant to their investigation. Investigators have previously said Officer Darren Wilson initially stopped Brown for walking in the street, not because the store reported a robbery.Watch CNN s explosive interview here:About 100 protesters gathered at the store Sunday night, forcing it to close, and gunshots were heard before midnight, but no one appeared to be injured, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.Gunfire erupted last night in front of the Ferguson store where Michael Brown was captured on surveillance video shoving the store clerk around, and now seen exchanging marijuana, as rioters gear up for a new fight in Ferguson.

Obamacare exploding? Maybe just a slow burn,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that Obamacare was “exploding” after Republican lawmakers shelved legislation that would have dismantled the healthcare law.  That’s not going to happen this month. Probably not even this year. The more than 12 million people who bought 2017 health insurance plans on HealthCare.gov and other websites the law created are not in danger of losing their healthcare or having their premiums go up right now, experts say. But 2018 is another story. Republicans could choose to pass a budget that defunds Obamacare’s cost-sharing subsidies, which help low-income people cover out-of-pocket and other medical costs. But that would be highly unpopular among consumers who would likely blame the president and Congress for skyrocketing healthcare costs, experts said.  “That is one of the ways that is available to monkey wrench the Affordable Care Act,” said Morgan Tilleman, an associate with the law firm Foley & Lardner, who represents insurers. Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature legislation created by the Affordable Care Act of 2010, has had a tough beginning. The mix of sick and healthy customers has been worse than expected, and premium rates on the individual insurance market went up 25 percent this year. Other parts of the law, like the expansion of Medicaid to enhance coverage for the poor, and changes to allow young people to stay on their parents’ health plans, have been popular. And the defeat of the bill is a win for the hospitals that have benefited from those increased Medicaid dollars. But many counties across the country have only one insurer, after Humana Inc, Aetna Inc and UnitedHealth Group Inc pulled out after reporting hundreds of millions of dollars of losses.      The insurers who are left, Anthem Inc and other BlueCross BlueShield insurers across the country, as well as smaller players like Centene Corp and Molina Healthcare Inc need to decide in the next few months where to sell insurance and how much to charge.  And that is where the market’s slow burn takes off, with insurers leaving and premiums rising. Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds who focuses on health care, said that for consumers, 2018 looks uncertain, with a “death spiral” of decreasing competition and increasing premium rates ramping up.  After the failed Republican effort to push through the bill, insurers are looking at changes to help 2018, America’s Health Insurance Plans spokeswoman Kristine Grow said. That includes the market’s cost-sharing subsidies as well as other government payments for sicker-than-usual customers and finalizing a rule the Trump administration proposed that addresses issues insurers say drives up costs.  The Trump administration could do some of that itself if it wants to, such as using its regulatory authority to adjust the formula for how it compensates insurers for the sickest people, Elizabeth Carpenter at healthcare consultancy and research firm Avalere Health said.  But it is unknown if the administration will try to work within the law’s existing framework or take actions to undermine it and blame the Democrats for its failure. “If they fail to act and they don’t act in an appropriate way, that will further destabilize the marketplace,” Dr. Mario Molina, CEO of Molina Healthcare, said. Molina’s enrollment ballooned to 1 million exchange enrollees this year and the company is weighing if it will submit plans for next year. The administration could also decide to not enforce the individual mandate, which requires that everyone purchase health insurance or pay a fine. It already took steps to erode that provision last month, when it backed off implementing tougher oversight that was due to go into effect for 2016 taxes. Experts said the individual mandate still cost less than purchasing insurance, but as it increases each year more young and healthy people would have incentive to join the healthcare market, helping to offset the cost of sicker patients.  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that 14 million more people would be uninsured under the Republican bill next year, with most of the increase coming from the repeal of the penalty associated with the individual mandate. It’s unclear what the Republicans will do. Trump said this bill had been shelved but that Republicans would end up with a “great” healthcare bill in the future, but for now that they are moving onto tax reform.  Until they do that, they will have to work within the 2010 Affordable Care Act. It can also undercut the healthcare law through regulatory authority at the Department of Health and Human Services.     ",politicsNews,"March 25, 2017 ",0
"Republicans win Obamacare legal challenge, add to insurer concerns","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday handed a victory to congressional Republicans who challenged President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, ruling that his administration overstepped its constitutional powers relating to government spending. U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer, based in Washington, ruled that the administration cannot spend billions of dollars in federal funds to provide subsidies under the law known as Obamacare to private insurers without the approval of Congress. At issue in the case, brought by the Republican-led House of Representatives, are reimbursements to insurance companies to compensate them for reductions that the law requires them to make to customers’ out-of-pocket medical payments. The ruling will not have an immediate effect on the law because the judge put the decision on hold pending an expected appeal by the administration. But it adds to uncertainty over the future of Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential and congressional elections, including whether enough health insurers will continue to participate in the program. Insurers have sustained losses from their Obamacare business, saying they have not attracted enough healthy customers to offset the costs of sicker members. Two of the largest players, UnitedHealth Group and Humana Inc, had already said they would not offer plans in many markets next year. “If you’re going to lose more money, why participate?” asked Steve Halper, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets. Shares in hospital operators such as Community Health Systems Inc fell sharply, while insurer stocks including Aetna Inc, which plans to remain in at least 15 Obamacare markets next year, also declined. In court papers, the administration had warned that a court victory for the House Republicans would lead to a spike in insurance premiums for Americans and force the government to pay more in tax credits to insurance policy-holders. As part of an appeal, the administration is likely to press its argument that the House lacks legal standing to sue.  “This suit represents the first time in our nation’s history that Congress has been permitted to sue the executive branch over a disagreement about how to interpret a statute,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. “It’s unfortunate that Republicans have resorted to a taxpayer-funded lawsuit to re-fight a political fight that they keep losing,” Earnest added. “They’ve been losing this fight for six years, and they’ll lose it again.” Conservatives have mounted a series of legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act since it was passed by Congress in 2010 over unified Republican opposition. Collyer was appointed to the bench by Republican former President George W. Bush. The law has helped bring insurance coverage to millions of Americans who previously had none, subsidizing the cost of insurance through tax credits. In addition, the federal government helped defray consumers’ out-of-pocket costs. The House Republicans argued that the administration’s action violated the U.S. Constitution because it is the legislative branch, not the executive branch, that authorizes government spending. “BIG win for the Constitution,” House Speaker Paul Ryan wrote on Twitter. Jonathan Turley, the lawyer who spearheaded the lawsuit, in a blog post called the ruling “a resounding victory not just for Congress but for our constitutional system as a whole.” The appeals court in Washington may be more receptive to the administration’s arguments, in part because seven of its 11 active judges are Democratic-appointees, including four picked by Obama. The case focuses on a cost-sharing provision of Obamacare that requires insurers to reduce deductibles and co-pays. Insurers are supposed to be reimbursed for these costs by the federal government. Cost-sharing is determined by the income of the policyholder and is a mechanism for reducing healthcare costs for lower-income households.  The Obama administration has interpreted the provision as a type of federal spending that does not need to be explicitly authorized by Congress. The House Republicans who filed the challenge disagreed. Collyer ruled that the cost-sharing provisions cannot be funded through the same permanent appropriation that covers tax credits made available under the law. The judge rejected the administration’s contention that the appropriation should be viewed as permanent because the alternative interpretation would lead to “absurd economic, fiscal and healthcare policy results.” The U.S. Supreme Court in June 2015, in a ruling authored by Bush-appointed Chief Justice John Roberts, rejected a conservative challenge that could have gutted Obamacare, upholding nationwide tax subsidies crucial to the law. Roberts also wrote a major 2012 ruling preserving Obamacare. ",politicsNews,"May 12, 2016 ",0
Texas lawyer sues Cruz to challenge eligibility,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Texas lawyer has filed the first suit seeking clarification on whether Republican candidate Ted Cruz is eligible to be president because he was born in Canada. Newton Schwartz, 85, of Houston also cited Cruz’s stance on issues such as abortion rights, gay marriage and the Bible in a 27-page argument against the Texas senator’s eligibility. Billionaire Donald Trump, the front-runner in the Republican presidential race, has repeatedly questioned whether Cruz is eligible and warned he could be sued, throwing the party into chaos and handing the election to the Democrats. A lawyer in Boston who reviewed the suit and who generally believes Cruz’s eligibility should be questioned said the suit was “defective” and would most likely be thrown out. Schwartz’s suit, which cites a “crescendo” of questions over the matter, was filed on Thursday in federal court in the Southern District of Texas. It is a class action, meaning other people can join, and it requests that a court rule on the issue before November’s presidential election. “If I lose the suit that’s fine, he’s eligible, but if he’s elected and he’s determined to be ineligible after the election, that would cause massive confusion,” Schwartz, a self-described liberal, said. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said there is no connection between Trump and Schwartz. Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta. His mother was a U.S. citizen and his father is Cuban. He has dismissed attacks on his eligibility and pointed out during a Republican candidates’ debate on Thursday that 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain and 1968 Republican candidate George Romney also were born outside the United States but still were considered eligible to be president. A Reuters poll found a quarter of Republicans think Cruz is not qualified because of his birthplace.[nL2N14Z098] A Cruz spokesman declined to comment on Schwartz’s suit. The U.S. Constitution says a president or vice president must be a “natural born citizen” but does not say whether the term means the candidate must be born on U.S. soil or just be a citizen at birth. Any child born to an American mother, no matter where, is considered a U.S. citizen. Schwartz’s lawsuit mentions domestic issues that could be affected if Cruz were president because he opposes abortion and gay marriage. Reached by phone, Schwartz said the issues did not relate to Cruz’s citizenship but that he had wanted to include them as examples of “some of the downside consequences of his being elected.” Vincent DeVito, a Boston lawyer who represented President George W. Bush during the contested 2000 presidential election, said the suit was “likely defective” and should have been filed in state court. “On its merits, the claim is legitimate,” DeVito said, “but the Schwartz pleading itself is poorly written and does not have a sophisticated legal nexus.” DeVito said he expected more suits to be filed challenging Cruz. The case is Schwartz v. Cruz, 4:16-cv-00106, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston).

 Muslim Family Restaurant Finds Creative Way To Tell Donald Trump To Go F*ck Himself,"Donald Trump and his deplorable supporters are going to lose their shit when they hear about this.Since 1960, Mama Ayesha s restaurant has served Middle Eastern cuisine in Washington D.C. in the same spot. Since 2009, it has been the home of a special presidential mural featuring Ayesha standing in unison with the last ten presidents, including President Obama. This is Mama welcoming the presidents to DC,  her great-nephew Abu-El-Hawa told the Washingtonian about the painting.  She was the American dream. For a Muslim and Arab woman immigrant from Palestine to come here on her own and build this business, is a remarkable legacy. The painting was commissioned in 2007 and supported by the DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities and was completed by artist Karla  Karlisima  Rodas, an immigrant from El Salvador.But Donald Trump will not be joining the ten presidents on the mural. And that s a good thing.When Ayesha passed away in 1993, she left the famous restaurant to her nephew, who is citing budgetary reasons for declining to add Trump to the mural. Our official position is that it is not in the budget,  Abu-El-Hawa stated.In other words, Trump can go f*ck himself.Donald Trump does not deserve to be recognized in a mural that celebrates diversity. Mama Ayesha is a Palestinian woman linking arms with ten presidents, one of whom is the first African-American president. It would also be insulting to President Obama since Trump would be shown linking arms with him.And that just does not jive well considering Trump is a racist divider who panders to white supremacists and wants to ban Muslims from the country, which would be an insult to Ayesha.Here s a look at the mural via YouTube.The mural serves as  Washington DC s largest postcard  and it s safe to say that Trump is not someone who will make people want to visit our nation s capital.Cue the temper tantrum from Trump and his supporters in 3 2 1 Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"December 29, 2016",1
 Trump SEETHING After Congressman Obliterates Him For ‘Nasty Woman’ Debate Insult (TWEETS),"There were many notable moments from last night s presidential debate thanks to Republican nominee Donald Trump, who made it a debate to remember (not necessarily a good thing, in his case). Not only did Trump imply that he would not accept the election s results if he was defeated by Hillary Clinton, but he once again proved that he has ZERO respect for women when he insulted her on the debate stage.Ironically, this attack came after Trump insisted that  no one has more respect for women than I do . Clinton had been talking about Social Security and Medicare, and Trump jumped in to interrupt so he could call her  such a nasty woman.  It was a completely random attack, and the perfect display of Trump s lack of self control and misogyny in action.As soon as it happened, social media exploded with rage as Americans rushed to criticize Trump s blatant disrespect of not only the former Secretary of State, but women everywhere. It wasn t long before the hashtag #nastywoman was being used far and wide, slamming the business mogul for his sexist outburst. One response, however, has Trump particularly p*ssed off. Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) said it best when he tweeted: Women who disagree with you aren t  nasty.  In this case, they are what is known as  right.' TwitterHell yes. And we all know how much fragile Donald HATES being proven wrong! More politicians jumped into the conversation on Trump s dangerous attitude toward women while watching the debate. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) also came forward to point out how dishonest Trump s remarks about respecting women were. Her attack was flawless:TwitterIf you look at any interview, footage, etc. of Trump talking about women before or during his presidential campaign, it is extremely rare that you ll find him saying something nice about them   much less respecting them. Trump has a horrifying long history of degrading, objectifying, insulting and belittling women, as well as a track record of sexually assaulting them. This man is dangerous for women and he is dangerous for America   everything he says and does proves that he cannot and should not be our next President.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,"October 20, 2016",1

U.S.-Russia tensions over Syria will not 'spiral out of control': Mattis,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tensions between the United States and Russia will not “spiral out of control” following last week’s U.S. cruise missile strikes on a Syrian air base, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Tuesday, describing it as a one-off response to Syria’s use of banned chemical weapons. President Donald Trump, in his biggest foreign policy decision since taking office in January, ordered the strikes after concluding that Syria waged a nerve gas attack in rebel-held territory that killed 87 people, many of them children.  Russia, which has advisers on the ground aiding Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, warned the U.S. strike could have serious consequences. Syria denies involvement. “It will not spiral out of control,” Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon. “I’m confident the Russians will act in their own best interest and there is nothing in their best interest to say they want this situation to go out of control.” Mattis has repeatedly warned that the U.S. military remained ready to act again should Assad use chemical weapons, saying on Tuesday that Assad would “pay a very, very stiff price.”    At the same time, he acknowledged that Trump had only authorized the single attack, meaning the U.S. military would not automatically have the authority to strike again should Washington determine another case of chemical weapons use. Mattis also sought to downplay concerns about Pentagon mission creep, saying the U.S. military’s focus in Syria was still fighting Islamic State militants, not becoming entangled in Syria’s messy civil war between Assad and his opponents. “The rest of the campaign stays on track exactly as it was before Assad’s violation,” Mattis said. The incident has chilled U.S. relations with Moscow after a presidential campaign during which Trump frequently called for an alliance with Russia to fight Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq. It has also led the Trump administration to harden its attitude against Assad weeks after top U.S. officials said they were more concerned with defeating Islamic State militants than getting Assad out of power. “I don’t see a peaceful, stable Syria in the future that has Assad in charge,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Tuesday. “I don’t see a future Syria that has (Assad) as the leader of that government.” U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson denounced Russian support for Assad as he prepared to fly to Moscow on Tuesday. “It is clear to us the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end,” Tillerson told reporters in Italy. U.S. intelligence indicates that Syrian Su-22 aircraft taking off from Shayrat airfield delivered the nerve agent sarin, according to a White House report given to reporters. Mattis said there was no doubt that Damascus was responsible. Although some U.S. officials have strongly hinted they suspect Russia, which has a presence at Shayrat, may have known something about the planned attack, none have conclusively linked Moscow to the incident itself. Mattis suggested the United States did not have firm evidence that Russia had foreknowledge or was complicit in the chemical attack. “It was very clear that the Assad regime planned it, orchestrated it and executed it and beyond that we can’t say right now. We know what I just told you, we don’t know anything beyond that,” Mattis said, when asked whether Russia had a role. ",politicsNews,"April 11, 2017 ",0

FEDERAL PROSECUTOR Working On Plea Deal For ISIS Supporter Who Wanted To Bomb LA Subway System And Daughter’s Day Care Center,"A plea deal for this punk will really make another terrorist think twice before attacking a major subway system or harming innocent Americans in the name of Allah The federal government s case against suspected Islamic State adherent Nicholas Teausant may have moved one step closer Tuesday to resolution without a trial, as a prosecutor said she will seek permission from Washington, D.C., to offer a deal to the defendant.In a brief hearing Tuesday morning in Sacramento s downtown federal courthouse, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jean Hobler said prosecutors must seek approval from the Justice Department s national security division before making an offer to Teausant and his lawyers.That offer is expected to be made to Teausant s defense team within a week, Hobler told U.S. District Judge John A. Mendez, who agreed to push the case back until Nov. 17, with the possibility of a guilty plea to an as-yet-undefined charge.Assistant Federal Defender Matthew Scoble told the judge lawyers are  cautiously optimistic  a resolution of the case can be reached.Documents filed in the case since Teausant s March 2014 arrest have teased out the notion that both sides were seeking a way to settle the matter without going to trial.Teausant, whose 22nd birthday is on Monday, is charged with one count of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, a charge that could net a 15-year prison sentence and $250,000 fine.He appeared in court Tuesday in an orange jail jumpsuit but did not speak during the hearing.Teausant said in a jailhouse interview with The Sacramento Bee in August 2014 that he hoped for a plea bargain that would incorporate some leniency. He denied wanting to stage any attacks against Americans.A former community college student and National Guard washout who lived in Acampo, near Lodi, Teausant was arrested as he tried to cross the border into Canada near Blaine, Wash.The FBI and prosecutors say his trip was part of a plan to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State, which has become the Obama administration s primary focus in its efforts against worldwide terror attacks.Court documents say he was tripped up by an informant and undercover FBI agent.Teausant s case has been delayed in part by questions about his mental state. In December 2014, the court found he was not competent, but after subsequent evaluations, he was found competent in August and the case proceeded.Another reason for some delay is that the prosecution includes evidence classified as secret by the government.Teausant, who is being held without bail at the Sacramento County jail, has been described in court papers as boasting of wanting to bomb the Los Angeles subway system and blow up his infant daughter s day care center because it was a  Zionist reform church. He allegedly boasted of wanting to train Islamic State fighters.  I m going to be a commander and I m going to be on the front of every single newspaper in the country,  he allegedly told the informant. Via: Creeping Sharia",politics,"Oct 29, 2015",1
"Obama aides slam Trump over claim about past presidents, fallen soldiers","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Aides to former U.S. President Barack Obama fired back on Tuesday as criticism mounted over President Donald Trump’s claim that past U.S. presidents did not contact family members of soldiers who died in combat during their time in the White House.     Trump offered no evidence to back up his claim on Monday, which was immediately pointed out to be false. His remarks came amid questions at a press conference over Trump not having responded yet to the deaths of four U.S. soldiers in an Oct. 4 ambush in Niger. Asked why he had not acknowledged the soldiers’ deaths, Trump said he would send letters to their families later on Monday and would call them “at some point during the period of time.” Obama’s former White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on Tuesday that Obama would repeatedly “show his enormous respect ... for those who had paid the ultimate sacrifice for our country” through various visits and meetings as well as phonecalls and letters. Trump, a Republican who as president serves as commander-in-chief of the U.S. military, then appeared to criticize his predecessors handling of the issue of American soldiers’ deaths.  “The traditional way, if you look at President Obama and other presidents, most of them didn’t make calls. A lot of them didn’t make calls,” Trump said. Pressed on his claim, particularly about Obama, Trump retreated.     “I don’t know if he did. No,” Trump said. “I was told that he didn’t often, and a lot of presidents don’t. They write letters ... I do a combination of both.” “President Obama, I think, probably did sometimes, and maybe sometimes he didn’t. I don’t know. That’s what I was told,” Trump added. “Other presidents did not call, they’d write letters. And some presidents didn’t do anything.”  Obama’s former aides were quick to lash back.  “Stop the damn lying - you’re the President,” Eric Holder, Obama’s former attorney general, said in a post on Twitter.  Alyssa Mastromonaco, Obama’s former deputy chief of staff, also called it a lie. Earnest, now an MSNBC commentator, told the network that past Republican and Democratic presidents had recognized their duty to honor soldiers’ sacrifices and not highlight their own actions. “Unfortunately, President Trump seems incapable of actually doing that,” Earnest said. A spokesperson for former President George W. Bush said he had called, written and visited the families of fallen soldiers. Representatives of former Presidents Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush and Jimmy Carter either did not immediately respond to a request for comment or did not have an immediate reaction.  An aide to Clinton told ABC News that he did call the families of fallen soldiers. ",politicsNews,"October 17, 2017 ",0
LEAKED DOCUMENTS: GEORGE SOROS GAVE 600K To Pro-Refugee Groups To Influence “Attitudes”," Leaked documents from left-wing financier George Soros s Open Society Foundations continue to reveal the extent to which the group has influenced the political response to Europe s refugee crisis. Internal documents show OSF used $600,000 in reserve funding in March 2016 to bring pro-refugee positions into the  political mainstream. Jordi Vaquer, OSF s regional director for Europe, approved a $600,000 proposal entitled,  Countering the anti-migrant rhetoric and toxic narratives surrounding migration in Europe. According to OSF documents, half of the $600,000 would go towards lobbying efforts. All $600,000 came from OSF s  Europe Reserve Fund. A summary of the proposal notes that  the proposed reserve fund allocation will allow for additional resources to be allocated towards countering xenophobic attitudes in Europe, move parts of the political mainstream towards more pro-refugee positions, and build constituencies around a more progressive approach to migration and asylum.

 United Airlines Pilot Calls For Hillary Clinton To Be ‘Hung’ (IMAGE),"Months before the potential inauguration of Hillary Clinton, we are beginning to see some of the same types of attacks against her that President Obama has been dealing with for eight years.Michael Folk is a West Virginia Republican in the House of Delegates and he s a pilot for United Airlines. He s also under fire for tweeting that Hillary Clinton should be  hung.  But of course, it was a joke, or something like that.The exact tweet was from Friday and it s since been deleted (likely by Twitter), but thank goodness for screen shots. It said,  Hillary Clinton, you should be tried for treason, murder, and crimes against the US Constitution  then hung (sic) on the Mall in Washington, DC. Folk claims to have tweeted it in a moment of petulance (my word, not his) after Clinton was acquitted of any legal wrongdoing in handling classified emails.Through a phone call with Folk Saturday, he says that he wrote the tweet after watching a video of Utah Republican Jason Chaffetz, who is Head of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Chaffetz asked a question to the inspector general of the Intelligence Community Charles McCullough, to see classified emails Clinton is alleged to have had on a private email server on CSPAN3.McCullough said that he couldn t show the emails to Congress without getting permission from the agency that owns that information, which frustrated Folk.Folk said if a private person had done what Clinton did, then they would be put in prison, which contradicts the FBI decision to not charge Clinton for the email scandal, and related the case to the scandal involving former Central Intelligence Agency Director David Petraeus back in 2012.Source: WOWK.comHis employer isn t happy.

BuzzFeed terminates Republican ad deal over Trump,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Online media outlet BuzzFeed has pulled out of an advertising deal reported to be worth $1.3 million with the Republican National Committee over objections to the party’s presumptive nominee Donald Trump. In an e-mail to employees on Monday, BuzzFeed founder and CEO Jonah Peretti wrote: “We don’t run cigarette ads because they are hazardous to our health, and we won’t accept Trump ads for the exact same reason.” “The Trump campaign is directly opposed to the freedoms of our employees in the United States and around the world and in some cases, such as his proposed ban on international travel for Muslims, would make it impossible for our employees to do their jobs,” Peretti wrote in the note, which was posted to BuzzFeed.com.  BuzzFeed declined further comment. Neither BuzzFeed nor the RNC would confirm the exact value of the deal, reported by Politico to be $1.3 million. According to an RNC official who declined to be identified, the deal was less than 1 percent of the party’s ad budget of about $150 million and was effectively a reservation for ad space, not a firm commitment to place ads with BuzzFeed. Trump’s campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said she had “nothing to add.”    The RNC provides national leadership for the Republican Party. Trump is expected to be officially nominated as the party’s candidate for the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election at the Republican National Convention in July.  ",politicsNews,"June 6, 2016 ",0
 Third Grader ROASTS Trump With Hilarious Letter Obliterating His Deportation Rhetoric (IMAGE),"Since the start of Donald Trump s presidential campaign, he s gone after pretty much every minority group there is. Along with his obvious and seemingly deliberate racism, he s also declared that he will deport all undocumented immigrants, mainly the ones he can tell by skin color. In other words, Latinos and Muslims. His words have been horrendous and have reached far and wide all across the United States.His words have even reached a young third grader, who seems to be taking an ESL (English as a Second Language) course, and their teacher in Ohio posted a letter the child wrote concerning Donald Trump to Facebook for all the world to see. Why? Because it s AMAZING.The letter reads, in its original grammar: I have a dream 2016!I have a dream that Donald Trump will not be president. But if he does all Asians, Africans and Mexicans have to go back to their contry. Without them the U.S.A. population will go down to 12,0000 people only. Most enginners are Indian then their won t be no tecnolegy! Without tecnolgy theirs no NETFLIX. Without netflix theirs no chill.

"Trump picks loyalists for economic posts, Obamacare critic for cabinet","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump chose a former Goldman Sachs banker and a billionaire investor on Tuesday to steer economic policy in his administration and a fierce Obamacare critic to dismantle President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare program.  Republican Trump is expected to name Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner and Hollywood financier, as his nominee for Treasury secretary, a source said, putting a Wall Street veteran in the top U.S. economic Cabinet post. Mnuchin, who spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before leaving in 2002 to launch a hedge fund, served as Trump’s campaign finance chairman. Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, known for his investments in distressed industries, is expected to be named commerce secretary, a source said. The announcements could come as early as Wednesday. The flurry of picks showed Trump, a real estate tycoon with no governing experience, rewarding loyalists and established Washington veterans as he rounds out his circle of top advisers. Republican U.S. Representative Tom Price, an orthopedic surgeon from Georgia, will be Trump’s health and human services   secretary. Seema Verma, the founder of a health policy consulting company, will lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is part of Health and Human Services and oversees government health programs for the poor and the elderly and insurance standards. Trump also announced his choice of Elaine Chao, labor secretary under President George W. Bush, to serve as secretary of transportation, saying in a statement that her expertise would be an asset “in our mission to rebuild our infrastructure.” While Trump made decisions on his economic team, he continued to mull over who should serve as his top diplomat. He dined with former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, a one-time critic and the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, at a French restaurant in New York on Tuesday night. Romney sharply criticized Trump during the presidential campaign but he offered praise after their dinner. “He continues with a message of inclusion, of bringing people together,” Romney told reporters. He said Trump’s Cabinet choices so far and speech on Election Night were encouraging.     Trump cast Price and Verma as a “dream team” to help him once he takes office on Jan. 20 with his campaign pledge to repeal Obamacare, the health law formally known as the Affordable Care Act. It has been a target of Republican attacks since its enactment in 2010. Price has characterized Obamacare as “doing real harm to American families” and has co-sponsored legislation to replace it. Verma helped Pence, the Indiana governor, add conservative pieces to Medicaid coverage for the state’s poor by requiring beneficiaries to make contributions to health savings accounts. She also worked on Medicaid programs in Iowa, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee. Chuck Schumer, the incoming Senate Democratic leader, was among the defenders of Obamacare who criticized Price’s selection. “Nominating Congressman Price to be the HHS secretary is akin to asking the fox to guard the hen house,” Schumer said.  The 2010 healthcare overhaul, aimed at expanding insurance coverage to millions more Americans, triggered a long, bitter fight between the White House and congressional Republicans, who said it created unwarranted government intervention in personal healthcare and private industry. Trump has said he will replace Obamacare with a plan to give states more control over Medicaid and allow insurers to sell plans nationally. Price and Verma will both need Senate confirmation. Congressional approval will be needed to repeal and change the health law. White House spokesman Josh Earnest defended Obamacare on Tuesday, saying it had expanded coverage to millions of Americans, boosted consumer protections and shored up the finances of the Medicare program for the elderly. “We’ll see if Trump care measures up,” he said. Trump said after meeting Obama following his Nov. 8 election victory that he would consider keeping the provisions of the healthcare law that let parents keep adult children up to age 26 on their insurance policies and that bar insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions. Price, an early Trump supporter in the U.S. House of Representatives who leads the budget committee, has proposed a plan that would create age-based tax credits for people who buy insurance coverage on their own. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Tuesday the eventual congressional plan to replace Obamacare would likely have much in common with Price’s ideas. Price’s plan would also roll back the 2010 law’s expansion of Medicaid for low-income people, a change that helped Obamacare cut the number of uninsured Americans to 29 million in 2015 from 49 million in 2010.  Trump vowed on the campaign trail to “save” Medicare, but Democrats said Price’s plans could amount to privatizing the government program for the elderly. Price has endorsed converting Medicare from a program that covers set benefits to a voucher-style program to help people buy coverage. “We say to Republicans who want to privatize Medicare: Go try it. Make our day,” Schumer said on Tuesday, saying the change would be unpopular with the public. Democrats also criticized the pick because Price has supported barring federal funds for Planned Parenthood, which provides some abortions in addition to birth control, health exams and other services. Trump has met about 70 people as he looks to shape his White House and Cabinet team. Chao, his pick for transportation secretary, was the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position, as labor secretary. She is married to Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Trump saw retired General David Petraeus, a potential candidate for the State Department or the Pentagon, on Monday. On Tuesday, he met Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Corker and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, as well as Romney, are in the running for secretary of state. Trump is set to launch a “thank you tour” of states he won in the election, starting with a rally on Thursday in Cincinnati, aides said. ",politicsNews,"November 28, 2016 ",0
" Trump Just SHUT DOWN ALL Of The Department Of The Interior’s Twitter Accounts, Because Reasons","The Department of the Interior has a Twitter account just like pretty much everyone else these days, including government agencies. But it seems that those agencies aren t immune to censorship from our dear, sweet, thin-skinned, narcissistic Cheeto-in-Chief. The Department of the Interior was ordered to shut down its Twitter accounts Friday evening after the National Park Service had the gall to post two, ahem, unflattering tweets.The first has been flying around social media, and has to do with Trump s pathetically dismal crowds, particularly in comparison to Obama s crowds for both of his inaugurations:The second tweet made note of gaps in policy on the new White House website, including scrubbing the site of anything having to do with civil rights, LGBTQ rights, climate change and the ACA.Apparently, it was a Park Service employee who retweeted these things, and either Trump himself couldn t handle it and wanted to show them who s really boss now, or the Dept. of the Interior is afraid enough of Trump to not only delete those two tweets, but comply with an order to shut down their entire Twitter presence. The Washington Post got hold of the email with that order: All bureaus and the department have been directed by incoming administration to shut down Twitter platforms immediately until further notice. It would actually be understandable for them to delete the offending tweets and reprimand, reassign, or even fire the employee responsible. But to have to shut down their entire Twitter presence because of two goddamn tweets from one agency?Welcome to Trump s America.The department has dozens of official Twitter accounts across ten agencies, but that email was described as an  urgent directive  with which they had to comply.An official with knowledge of the incident sounds a bit like he s been cowed:A government official familiar with the stand-down said the agency is investigating whether the retweets were purposeful,  errant  or  whether we ve been hacked. They were not reflective of Park Service policy,  said the official, who requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the directive. The stand-down was  precautionary  until the agency completes a review of its Twitter accounts, the official said.This is terrifying. This is dictatorial behavior, not the behavior of an incoming president who believes in democracy.Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images",News,"January 21, 2017",1
U.S. companies sign billions in deals with Vietnam,"WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) - U.S. companies signed business deals with Vietnam worth over $8 billion on Wednesday, including power projects and jet engines from General Electric Co (GE.N) and diesel generator technology from Caterpillar (CAT.N), the Commerce Department said. The 13 deals were announced as Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc met with U.S. President Donald Trump as part of a three-day, trade-focused trip to the United States. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who has pledged to shrink U.S. trade deficits, said the transactions would include $3.4 billion in U.S. produced content that would support 23,000 jobs. But the Trump administration still wants more work from Vietnam to bring down a rapidly growing $32 billion trade surplus with the United States, said Murray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “I heard from U.S. officials ahead of the trip that just signing deals with U.S. companies was nice but not enough,” Hiebert said. GE said on Wednesday it had signed deals in Vietnam worth about $5.58 billion for power generation, aircraft engines and services, its largest single combined sale with the country in GE’s history. GE’s agreement with Vietjet Aviation JSC VJC.HM includes 20 jet engines made by CFM International, a joint venture of GE and Safran SA (SAF.PA) of France. It also includes a 12-year engine service contract for 215 LEAP-1B engines on 100 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft that Vietjet has ordered, GE said. GE’s power unit signed a memorandum of understanding to build two 750-megawatt gas fired turbine power plants in conjunction with state energy group PetroVietnam, using the Blue Whale gas field. GE also signed a joint development agreement to erect an 800-megawatt wind power facility. Partners in the agreement are Phu Cuong Group and International Mainstream Renewable Power, GE said. Honeywell (HON.N) also signed a $100 million deal to supply VietJet with 98 auxiliary power units for the airline’s new fleet of Airbus (AIR.PA) A320 aircraft, including maintenance for 12 years. Caterpillar and its dealer in Vietnam, Phu Thai Cat, agreed to provide generator management technology for more than 100 generators in Vietnam, the company said. The technology would allow for remote function monitoring including fuel, temperature and pressure. The value of the Caterpillar deal was not disclosed. Hilton Worldwide (HLT.N) signed a deal worth $650 million to manage a 610-room dual-branded hotel in Vietnam, while port security firm Passport Systems Inc signed a deal worth $1 billion, with $420 million in U.S. content, Commerce said.

Vietnam's Facebook dissidents test the limits of Communist state,"HANOI (Reuters) -  This isn t like China,  says Vietnamese activist  Anh Chi  at a noisy bar off one of the narrow streets of Hanoi s Old Quarter.  They can t shut Facebook down here.  His 40,000 Facebook followers make him one of Vietnam s better-known critics, but by no means the biggest in a Communist state whose attempts to crack down on dissidents have collided with the rapidly expanding reach of foreign-owned social media. Vietnam s President Tran Dai Quang this month called for unspecified tougher internet controls in the face of  hostile forces  that he said threatened not only cybersecurity but also  undermined the prestige of the leaders of the party and the state . But taming the internet in a young, fast-growing country is not easy, especially when the companies providing the platform are global. China, in contrast, allows only local internet companies operating under strict rules. Vietnam is among Facebook s top 10 countries, by number of members. It now reports more than 52 million active accounts to advertisers, according to research provided to Reuters by social media agencies We Are Social and Hootsuite. Google s YouTube and Twitter are popular too. As elsewhere in Southeast Asia, social media underpins business and communications as well as government critics. Some dissidents posting on social media have been caught in a major crackdown that has followed changes in the ruling party hierarchy. At least 15 people have been arrested this year. High profile bloggers Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, known as  Mother Mushroom , and Tran Thi Nga have been jailed for 10 and nine years respectively. Government critics also complain of beatings by unidentified assailants and intimidation. But dozens of activists still post critical comment every day. Several have more than 100,000 followers and at least one has over 400,000 - more than double that for the government s own Facebook page and nearly a 10th the size of the Communist Party s national membership.  We use any chance we have to raise our voice: environmental issues, territorial issues, land issues,  said  Anh Chi , 43, a Vietnamese teacher, translator and publisher whose real name is Nguyen Chi Tuyen. Vietnam tried to pressure Facebook (FB.O) and Google (GOOGL.O) to take down thousands items of anti-government content in March by leaning on advertisers, but the continued prevalence suggests limited success. One reason it is hard to take tougher action is business: From brewers to insurers to the makers of the motorbikes buzzing Vietnam s streets, social media is a key marketing route to young and increasingly affluent consumers in an economy growing at more than 6 percent a year, one of the fastest rates in Asia. For small businesses it is crucial: One new silk flower shop in Hanoi told Reuters 95 percent of customers found it through Facebook or Instagram.  You ve got kids that are building businesses on these platforms and generating significant success,  said Simon Kemp, founder of the Kepios marketing consultancy. While it accounts for only a tiny part of Facebook or Google parent Alphabet s revenue, Vietnam is a hot target for global consumer brands. Asia-Pacific was Facebook s fastest growing region by revenue last year, up nearly 60 percent. Tighter Internet controls could dampen innovation and impact the growth of Vietnam s digital economy and its competitiveness, said Jeff Paine, managing director of the Asia Internet Coalition, whose members include Facebook, Google and Twitter. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment. Google declined to comment. Vietnam s foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang told Reuters the government was an advocate of the internet but tried to minimize  behaviors that harm users and illegal acts such as inciting violence and a depraved lifestyle . China blocked Facebook in 2009 and only local sites such as WeChat and Weibo are permitted, operating under laws that ban content that is obscene, violent or offends the Communist Party.  China has had remarkable success controlling discussion,  said David Bandurski, co-director of the China Media Project and a fellow of the Robert Bosch Academy in Berlin. Tools include keyword filtering by the local internet companies and the close monitoring of big networks, he said. Even so, China has said it is investigating its top social media sites for failing to comply with its laws. Facebook has been blocked in Vietnam occasionally - sometimes at sensitive moments - but never for long.  Vietnamese authorities have tried for years and so far failed to stop independent journalists and bloggers from using the internet,  said Shawn Crispin, Southeast Asia representative of the Committee to Protect Journalists.  It s a losing battle.  That does not stop activists being targeted for arrest. Activist Pham Doan Trang noted on Facebook that some campaigners appeared to have withdrawn from the scene in the face of the crackdown, but said she would not be discouraged.  Freedom has a very funny rule,  she told Reuters  Once people know the limit of freedom they will never go back.  ",worldnews,"August 29, 2017 ",0
 WATCH: Trump Loves The GOP Healthcare Bill But Kellyanne Conway Doesn’t Want His Name On It,"If Trump isn t willing to attach his name to something, you know it must really be bad no matter how  wonderful  he says it is.On Monday, House Republicans passed what they dubiously refer to as the  American Healthcare Act,  which repeals the Affordable Care Act.The bill would strip healthcare from millions of Americans, including the millions who were able to access Medicaid coverage. The bill also defunds Planned Parenthood and sticks senior citizens with higher costs among a litany of other things that screw over the American people.On Tuesday, Donald Trump praised the bill on Twitter.Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation. ObamaCare is a complete and total disaster   is imploding fast!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 7, 2017Of course, the only reason why the Affordable Care Act is  imploding  is because Trump and Republicans have been sabotaging it.But as  wonderful  as Trump says the  Make America Sick Again  bill is, his propaganda minister Kellyanne Conway is desperate to make sure Trump s name is not attached to it.After being asked by Fox News host Bill Hemmer if it would be okay to call the bill  Trumpcare,  Conway was quick to reply that Trump s name should not be associated with it in such a way. It s the American Health Care Act, and I think it s aptly named that for this reason,  Conway said.  It wants to cover, it wants everyone to have access to coverage, and that is something that didn t happen under Obamacare  I ll call it Trumpcare if you want to, but I didn t hear President Trump say to any of us,  I want my name on that.  It s not about branding according to someone s name. This is serious business. Here s the video via YouTube:Gee, that didn t stop Republicans from branding the Affordable Care Act as  Obamacare,  even though the landmark healthcare law was  aptly named  because it actually made healthcare more accessible and affordable for millions of Americans.Trump s  American Healthcare Act  only strips millions of Americans of their healthcare coverage. It does nothing to give coverage to everyone. If Trump wants to cover all Americans he would push for universal healthcare, not a bill that takes healthcare away from millions, including people who voted for him.The real reason why Conway doesn t want Trump s name on the bill is because it s a bad bill that will harm a lot of people. In fact, it will likely lead to the deaths of many Americans.Trump and his Republican sycophants don t give a shit about all the people they are going to hurt by repealing the Affordable Care Act.

" After Charlottesville GOP Asks Supporters How Trump Is Doing: Great, Good, Or Just Okay?","Donald Trump has a massive ego, so much so that he s claimed several times that he won the popular vote (he didn t win the popular vote). The former reality show star is seven months into the job and he s still in campaign mode, holding ego-rallies while bringing up  Crooked  Hillary Clinton on Twitter in order to deflect from his scandal-plagued administration. But Trump s failure to directly blame the Nazis who stormed the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia in his name while carrying torches and shouting  Blood and soil,  a Nazi Germany era slogan and  Jews will not replace us!  has resulted in a backlash of epic proportions. The Alt-Righters are his people and instead of denouncing them for the murder of a Heather Heyer, 32, while leaving 19 others injured, he blamed  both sides. That said, the GOP gives three options in their latest poll which is titled,  Official Presidential Job Performance Poll. How would you rate President Trump s job performance so far?  the  poll  asks.Your choices are:Great.Good.Okay.Other.We re not saying that you should take the poll (you should take the poll) but that  other  option is screaming for attention. According to the latest Gallup poll, Trump s approval rating is at a dismal 34 percent. If it gets much lower, he ll be in Nixon territory and Mr. Watergate, unlike Trump, started his presidency with strong approval ratings. By the end of his presidency, Nixon s approval rating had tumbled to 24 percent. Now, Nixon may not have had support from Nazis but he did have Roger Stone.Trump s approval ratings are worse than Bill Clinton s were at the height of the proceedings to impeach him because he was the recipient of an adulterous blow job. The Trump campaign s collusion with Russia scandal is rocking the White House but Robert Mueller is all over that. Because Trump can t control his own temper, he lashed out at the media while blaming the victims of a terror attack perpetrated by one of his own followers so we re going to link to the totally  official  poll again.Photo by Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images.",News,"August 19, 2017",1
"US-Saudi Plan: Let 9,000 ISIS Fighters Walk Free from Mosul – to Fight in Syria"," Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireJudging by both the words, and deeds of the Obama White House and its political  diplomatic  appointees led by perfidious John Kerry and caustic Samantha Power   all evidence to date points to the US wanting to escalate its war on Syria   while happily baiting a military confrontation, and World War  scenario with Russia and its allies in the process. If this latest leak is indeed true   and time will certainly tell whether or not it is, it would constitute one of the most egregious violations of both US and international law   by the United States government and its theocratic dictator partner in Saudi Arabia.Washington s own anti-terror legislation expressly forbids colluding to provide logistical or material support for terrorist groups, and this US-Saudi venture would be the latest in a long list of violations  According to news released today (see report below), US President Barack Obama has been briefed that the operation to liberate the ISIS stronghold in Mosul in Iraq is scheduled for the second half of October. Here s what makes this a potential shocker: the operation allows for safe passage for 9,000 ISIS fighters on the proviso that they are transferred from Iraq to eastern Syria in order to help US plans for  regime change  there. At the time of the assault, coalition aircraft would strike only on a pre-agreed detached buildings in the city, which are empty, the source said. According to him [the source], the plan of Washington and Riyadh also provides that the rebels move from Mosul to Syria for the attack on the government-controlled town of troops. Essentially, Washington and Saudi Arabia, will allow 9,000 ISIS (Islamic State) fighter FREE passage into Syria if they agree to join Washington s  regime change  operations there. This could also include,   eastern regions of Syria to follow a major offensive operation, which involves the capture of Deir ez-Zor and Palmyra,  the source added.Before you write this story off as some ornate Russian psychological operation, consider the long trend arch. The US along with its generous Gulf sidekicks, have already established a solid track record of aiding and abetting ISIS   not just in Syria, but in Iraq too.The record shows that the US is guilty on a number of counts If the Mosul leak is true, then it wouldn t be the first time that the US has provided cover in the military pantomime the world has come to know as  the fight against ISIS.  When large ISIS convoys crossed the Syrian desert to invade and occupy the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra in May 2015, the US  Coalition  airforce did nothing, and allowed ISIS to take and destroy part of the world s great historic cultural heritage, along with the murder of scores of innocent civilians.Professor Tim Anderson from Sydney University states: U.S. weapons with Israeli ammunition were used by Islamic State group when taking over Palmyra. The extremists also had U.S. military rations. The U.S., which since 2014 claimed to be conducting a war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and which had air power and sophisticated surveillance of the region, did nothing to stop the huge ISIS advance on Palmyra. The US isn t even shy about its laissez-faire policy with ISIS in the field, with the New York Times openly boasting,  Any airstrikes against Islamic State militants in and around Palmyra would probably benefit the forces of President Bashar al-Assad. So far, United States-led airstrikes in Syria have largely focused on areas far outside government control, to avoid the perception of aiding a leader whose ouster President Obama has called for. Following the derelict incident, New York Times reporters Hwaida Saad and Kareem Fahim, were still kicking and screaming for  regime change like petulant children at the news of ISIS fleeing and Palmyra being liberated by the Syrian Army and Russians. They said that,  Mr. Assad s contention that his government is a bulwark against the transnational extremist group  has been bolstered, but added that  his foes and some allies argue that he must leave power as part of a political settlement to end the war in Syria. In other words:  we still want regime change!  This says volumes about who is really enforcing New York Times editorial lines (either the US State Dept, or the CIA, take your pick).More importantly however, is what kind of message an US statement like that sends to ISIS, as well as Al Nusra and other terrorist brigades inside Syria, which is basically,  we do not need to worry about US air strikes, only Syrian Army and Russian strikes.  This situation really sums up the utter fraud and contempt of the US deception in Syria, and it s no surprise that the Russian Foreign Ministry are reticent to extend themselves any more where the US is concerned.Then, in March 2016, when ISIS fled Palmyra, back across the desert towards Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa   the great and powerful US  Coalition  airforce actually helped ISIS in a number of ways, including allowing them free passage once more.In late August, we were told that the Turkish Army, alongside  allied Syrian rebels  (terrorist group Faylaq al-Sham) backed by the US air cover, invaded Syria in order to capture the  ISIS-held  town of Jarabulus, Syria, this supposedly to cut off ISIS s last open route into Turkey. But what happened to ISIS?The NYT even admitted that,  it appeared that most of the militants had fled without a fight. Here, ISIS appears to have been given advanced warning   by either US or Turkish intelligence, as they left the contested town of Jarabulus quietly, but in droves. In reality, Turkey twisted this operation in order to attack and degrade Kurdish militias including the US-backed artificial construct called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), and pro-Kurdish People s Protection Units (YPG) and Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), the Syrian affiliate of the militant Kurdistan Workers  Party (PKK) in Iraq and Turkey   all of whom are meant to be fighting ISIS. Instead, they are now busy dodging Turkish artillery rounds. Confusing, yes, but true nonetheless.It s also common knowledge now, that top of the line US weaponry is being used by ISIS, both in Iraq, in Afghanistan and in Syria as well. In fact, if not for US weapons and supplies (along with US air intervention, or noninterventions), ISIS would have struggled to maintain many of the strategic positions it enjoys today. For the last 3 years, US officials have been dodging this issue, and when they do admit this is true, their patronizing party line is that,  this must be a mistake, if they do have US weapons, we didn t mean it.  As if the world was born yesterday.Perhaps the most flagrant violation by the US-led forces in aiding and abetting ISIS took place on Sept 17, 2016, when the US-led Coalition bombed Syrian Army positions outside of Deir ez-Zor near al-Tharda Mountain, killing some 80 soldiers and injuring 100 more.  As if by design, an ISIS offensive began immediately following the US massacre of Syrian soldiers. Clearly, this bold move by the Pentagon paved the way for a major ISIS advance.To any normal observer, the US attack was a belligerent act of war that effective destroyed an already fragile bilateral ceasefire agreement, and yet the US response was to somehow blame Russia for calling an emergency UNSC meeting to discuss the incident. Judging by this response, it s pretty clear that US wants to see the Syrian Conflict carry on for a while, and it will need groups like ISIS to make that happen. The other problem with Washington s hollow righteousness in the Middle East is that there are key members of the US-led Coalition  who are financing ISIS, Al Nusra Front, Nour al Din Zinki, and Arar al Sham (all  moderate terrorists we re told) militants in Syria, Iraq and beyond. This fact was recently admitted by former US Secretary of State and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, as revealed in this week s batch of Wikileaks emails. Clinton writes: While this military/para-military operation is moving forward, we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region. Add to that the multiple exposures over the last 3 years of the US CIA illegally trafficking lethal arms to Al Nusra and other terrorists through covert operations like Timber Sycamore.Still, US and NATO member state officials and their media gatekeepers continue to deny it and play dumb, rather than come clean that the United States and its  partners  in the region are helping, not hindering ISIS terrorism.Some might ask: why would they do a thing like that? By now, the answer should be simple, but threefold:What s so comical yet even more tragic, is how prominent the topic of  ISIS  factors into all of the vapid  national security  debates and media panels in this year s US Presidential election, and in the dumbed-down  coverage of the delusional US mainstream media, led by Pentagon surrogate CNN, and hopeless FOX News. Judging by their prosaic  coverage , neither the networks, nor Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump have the slightest clue of what the reality on the ground is. Instead we here,  My ISIS plan is better than yours!  The US political conversation has gone beyond ridiculousness.The corps of US military and CIA media spokesman aren t much better. The sad part is some of them do know what is really happening, but would rather lie to the American public.With so much double dealing, who can you trust? Certainly not anyone in Washington.More on the White House s latest dangerous proposition .RTThe US and Saudi Arabia have agreed to grant free passage to thousands of Islamic State militants before the Iraqi city of Mosul is stormed. The jihadists will be redeployed to fight against the government in Syria, a military-diplomatic source told RIA Novosti. More than 9,000 Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS, ISIL) militants will be redeployed from Mosul to the eastern regions of Syria to carry out a major offensive operation, which involves capturing Deir ez-Zor and Palmyra,  the source said.According to the anonymous diplomatic source, US President Barack Obama has already sanctioned an operation to liberate Mosul, due to take place in October.During the storm of the city in northern Iraq the US-led coalition s planes would only strike detached, vacated or uninhabited buildings, while keeping terrorists as targets, he said.In September, US Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter confirmed that Washington would send an additional 600 troops to Iraq to help liberate Mosul at the request of the local authorities.The source suggested that redeployment of IS militants is necessary because  Washington must somehow counter Russia s achievements in Syria, try to diminish their importance. Apart from the purely political dividends, the other purpose of this operation, obviously, will be to discredit the success of Russian Airspace forces. And, of course, it s an attempt to undermine Syrian President (Bashar) Assad,  he said.The leadership of Saudi Arabia s General Intelligence Directorate will be the mediators and guarantors of the agreement on safe passage for the jihadists from Mosul, he claimed.The source added that a similar scheme had been used by the US and its allies during the liberation of the Iraqi city of Fallujah Continue this story at RTREAD MORE SYRIA NEWS: 21st Century Wire Syria FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"October 13, 2016",1
BUCKLE UP: 2008 Was Just A “Warm-Up”…Facts Show The REAL Financial Crisis Is Coming,"A fake economy can only sustain itself for so long The Fed is out of control,  exclaims David Stockman   perhaps best known for architecting Reagan s economic turnaround known as  Morning in America    adding that  people don t want to hear the reality and the truth that we re facing. Well, it s one of the scariest moments I think in our history, but also we need to recognize we re in uncharted waters. No central bank has ever printed this much money this long, kept interest rates at zero, fueled so much speculation. Not just here, but worldwide.-David StockmanFor six years, the world has operated under a complete delusion that Central Banks somehow fixed the 2008 Crisis.All of the arguments claiming this defied common sense. A 5th grader would tell you that you cannot solve a debt problem by issuing more debt. If the below chart was a problem BEFORE 2008  there is no way that things are better now. After all, we ve just added another $10 trillion in debt to the US system.Similarly, anyone with a functioning brain could tell you that a bunch of academics with no real-world experience, none of whom have ever started a business or created a single job can t  save  the economy.However, there is an AWFUL lot of money at stake in believing these lies. So the media and the banks and the politicians were happy to promote them. Indeed, one could very easily argue that nearly all of the wealth and power held by those at the top of the economy stem from this fiction.So it s little surprise that no one would admit the facts: that the Fed and other Central Banks not only don t have a clue how to fix the problem, but that they actually have almost no incentive to do so.So here are the facts:1) The REAL problem for the financial system is the bond bubble. In 2008 when the crisis hit it was $80 trillion. It has since grown to over $100 trillion.2)The derivatives market that uses this bond bubble as collateral is over $555 trillion in size.3)Many of the large multinational corporations, sovereign governments, and even municipalities have used derivatives to fake earnings and hide debt. NO ONE knows to what degree this has been the case, but given that 20% of corporate CFOs have admitted to faking earnings in the past, it s likely a significant amount.4) Corporations today are more leveraged than they were in 2007. As Stanley Druckenmiller noted recently, in 2007 corporate bonds were $3.5 trillion  today they are $7 trillion: an amount equal to nearly 50% of US GDP.5) The Central Banks are now all leveraged at levels greater than or equal to where Lehman Brothers was when it imploded. The Fed is leveraged at 78 to 1. The ECB is leveraged at over 26 to 1. Lehman Brothers was leveraged at 30 to 1.6) The Central Banks have no idea how to exit their strategies. Fed minutes released from 2009 show Janet Yellen was worried about how to exit when the Fed s balance sheet was $1.3 trillion (back in 2009). Today it s over $4.5 trillion.We are heading for a crisis that will be exponentially worse than 2008. The global Central Banks have literally bet the financial system that their theories will work. They haven t. All they ve done is set the stage for an even worse crisis in which entire countries will go bankrupt.The situation is clear: the 2008 Crisis was the warm up. The next Crisis will be THE REAL Crisis. The Crisis in which Central Banking itself will fail. Via: Zero HedgeDavid Stockman:Well, it s one of the scariest moments I think in our history, but also we need to recognize we re in uncharted waters. No central bank has ever printed this much money this long, kept interest rates at zero, fueled so much speculation. Not just here, but worldwide. Not just in the normal stocks and bonds, but the whole shale boom, for instance, in the United States was massively funded by cheap debt based on oil prices that weren t sustainable, and now that s all coming unwound. We have never had deficits of ten percent of GDP back to back, or even still four or five percent four or five years into a recovery.We have a runaway budget where the population is getting older and older, 10,000 people are retiring every day. Nothing is being done about Social Security. It s a festering time bomb, and we re not sure how it will explode, but we know it isn t sustainable. We have a Wall Street that is more addicted to pure overnight gambling and trading and speculation for the ultra short run that is driven by robo traders, the so-called HFT money, like never before. It s unstable. That s why we see things happen like the overnight 40 percent gain with the Swiss Franc when the Swiss National Bank pulled the pay.Forty percent overnight   not overnight, but in a couple of minutes or seconds when there were hundreds of billions of short positions in the Swiss Franc. All of these things have never existed simultaneously, not only in the United States, but worldwide. All the central banks are doing it. We re reaching the point where it s unsustainable, things are going to give and break, but the good thing is it s going to be more a disaster in the financial markets in my view, less some kind of Great Depression impact on Main Street. It will be difficult on Main Street, but Wall Street is in the gun sites of this disaster coming.",politics,"Oct 29, 2015",1
Virginia Shooter Hodgkinson Was ‘Never Trump’ Fanatic and Devotee of Bernie Sanders,"IMAGE: Democratic Party activist and gunman, James T. Hodgkinson.21st Century WireYesterday, a crazed gunman affiliated with America s radical  progressive  and  Never Trump  movement attacked Republican members of Congress and their staff during a practice session for an annual charity baseball game in Alexandria, Virginia.Steve Scalise (R-LA)Among those shot were Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), the third ranking Republican in the House.In total, five people were wounded, including two police officers. All were taken to local hospitals for treatment.According to Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, Scalise was standing on second base, fielding balls during batting practice when the shooting began.Had the Capitol Police not been on the scene It would have been a massacre,  said Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.  As terrible as it is, it could have been a lot worse. The gunman, James T. Hodgkinson, was shot dead by police, dying later of multiple wounds.Hodgkinson, 66, is from Belleville, Illinois, was an ardent supporter of 2016 Democratic Party  presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, but also expressed a rabid hatred of conservatives and President Donald Trump as seen in his Facebook profiles and letters to newspapers. Trump is a Traitor. Trump Has Destroyed Our Democracy. It s Time to Destroy Trump & Co,  and Republicans are the Taliban of the USA,  said Hodgkinson.Watch this cell phone footage of the event:However, the story appeared to be an embarrassment for Democratic Party-oriented mainstream media outlets like CNN and MSNBC. Not surprisingly, CNN seemed to avoid any extended coverage of the shooting, opting instead to focus most of its news coverage yesterday on the Grenfell Tower fire in London. Ever since Hillary Clinton s epic defeat last November, most US mainstream media organizations have been going all-out to discredit the new president. CNN s own Kathy Griffin, a 56-year-old  comedian  sparked public outrage last month after releasing a photo and video depicting her holding the bloodied head of President Trump in an ISIS-style video.Other liberal media sources are attempting to frame the attack as a  gun control  story, rather than a politically-motivated act of domestic terrorism.The following is a live debate which aired on RT International on Wednesday night, featuring 21WIRE s Patrick Henningsen, Tighe Barry from Code Pink, and  Lionel  a frequent contributor on RT America.

" FBI Tells Trump To Go F*ck Himself For Firing Their Director, Forces Him To Cancel Visit","Donald Trump was hoping to visit the FBI for a photo-op in the wake of firing FBI Director James Comey. The FBI told Trump to f*ck off.In the days since Comey s firing, it has been revealed that Trump pulled the trigger in retaliation against the FBI investigation into his Russia scandal. Trump demanded that Comey be loyal to him and Comey refused to put Trump above the security of the country. Trump has even admitted that the Russia investigation was in his mind when he fired Comey.This contradicted the official White House statement on Comey s firing, which has sparked national outrage as most Americans disapprove of Trump s action.Trump was hoping for applause. Instead, he made things worse for himself. Now it s clear that he has something to hide.But he didn t just anger the American people. He pissed off the FBI, most of whom loved their former boss.So when Donald Trump wanted to visit the FBI on Thursday, they told him not to bother. Trump then tucked his tail between his legs and had the White House cancel the visit. He likely then threw a temper tantrum like a toddler. The FBI told the White House the optics would not be good,  NBC s Peter Alexander reported as the news came in.  FBI officials apparently said the president was unlikely to be greeted warmly after having just unceremoniously fired a very popular director. Alexander further explained that while many FBI agents voted for Trump, they don t like that he fired Comey and are disgusted by how Trump did it.Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump just turned the FBI into his enemy, and that means they are going to work double-time on the investigation into his ties with Russia. And I m sure they will be all too happy to slap cuffs on Trump and haul his sorry ass to jail when the time comes.Featured image Shawn Thew   Pool/Getty Images",News,"May 12, 2017",1

 Denny’s Serves Up A Grand Slam Of Racism By Forcing Black Family To Pre-Pay For Meal," America s Diner  Denny s, has lived up to that title if you are looking at it in the context of how much racism exists in the nation. Henry Williams and Renee Hebert settled in a lawsuit against the company, that stemmed from an incident in 2014 when an L.A. Denny s forced them to prepay for their meal because they were ordering food while black.Williams was told by employees that he would have to hand over the cash in full to cover the meal before his group would be served. Clearly, a group of black individuals going to a restaurant is suspicious enough to assume a conspiracy to do the  dine and dash  is in the works. Surprisingly, Williams decided to actually hand over the money rather than take his business elsewhere. Maybe he really likes the Moons Over My Hammy meal.The ridiculousness of this was so bad, that even the Denny s manager eventually realized how bad his people screwed up and tried to return the money. The manager was so desperate to give the money back that Williams actually had to tell him to stop repeatedly coming over to their table to grovel and hand over the cash because he was being a nuisance. The manager kicked it up a notch by offering free dessert, to which Williams said he wanted to box his food and leave.Williams and Hebert said that nobody else was asked to pre-pay for their meal. In court, a customer that was seated nearby at the time testified that Williams and Hebert handled the situation well: They were black. I m white. I ve never been asked to prepay. I thought it was appalling for someone in that year and time to be discriminated against like that. Denny s tried to argue against the lawsuit because the customers  order was a large one, and the location had other problems with people walking out on checks before. It got pretty damning, though, when the other customer testifying on behalf of Williams said that they had seen the restaurant targeting other black patrons to pre-pay in weeks prior. I bet not every case of these was a  huge order.  Denny s already had a bad reputation in this area, because it had to pay $54 million in 1994 for a case of similar discrimination against black customers.The details of the settlement were not disclosed, but it would be a safe bet that it was more than the cost of a dine-and-dash.Featured image from wikicommons",News,"February 11, 2016",1

 Dozens Arrested During Massive Global Fossil Fuel Protest (VIDEOS),"An ongoing demonstration taking place outside of Anacortes, WA. The protestors created a blockade on the BNSF Railway tracks, which lead to two oil refineries. One of which is owned by Shell, the other is owned by Tesoro. The protest began on Friday, as a part of a global wave of protests against the continued use of fossil fuels. The international  break free  protest demands that the world immediately transition to a fossil fuel-free energy system. Thousands of people all over the world have come together to protest and to take direct actions against fossil fuel companies have taken place on six continents over the course of two weeks. Last summer we stopped Shell s Arctic drilling plans, now we re taking our biggest actions yet. The movement for climate justice is growing and getting bolder by the day. A fossil-free Northwest isn t a fantasy, it s inevitable; if we start now, the change can be fair and rational, and we can demonstrate our leadership,  says organizer Ahmed Gaya said in a press release.Below is a video that shows the very beginning of the encampment.In addition to the blockade, thousands of activists in Washington staged marched in protests and took part in a massive flotilla of kayaks holding banners and signs demanding an immediate transformation to a 100% renewable energy system.https://www.facebook.com/BackboneCampaign/photos/ms.c.eJwzNDA0NTczMTY0tzAyNzAyMNMzRIiYmGKImJmiiRiZYerCUGMOEgEAhxkVfg~-~-.bps.a.10157643178105206.1073741894.19984125205/10157643178270206/?type=3&theaterHere is a photo of the police who broke up the encampment:https://www.facebook.com/BackboneCampaign/photos/a.10157647965685206.1073741897.19984125205/10157647965990206/?type=3&theater On Saturday, about 1,500 people took part in a blockade against bomb trains in Albany, New York.I'm in Albany, NY to support the campaign to @BanBombTrains as part of #breakfree2016.

"Trump administration switches sides, backs Ohio over voter purges","(Reuters) - The Trump administration has reversed an Obama administration stance and will support Ohio in its bid at the U.S. Supreme Court to revive a state policy of purging people from voter-registration lists if they do not regularly cast ballots. The Justice Department filed legal papers with the high court on Monday staking out the new position in the voting rights case, backing the Republican-led state’s policy to purge inactive voters. Former President Barack Obama’s Justice Department had argued in a lower court that Ohio’s policy violated the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, which Congress passed to make it easier for Americans to register to vote.  Civil liberties advocates who challenged Ohio’s policy have said it illegally erased thousands of voters from registration rolls and can disproportionately impact minorities and poor people who tend to back Democratic candidates. The state on Tuesday welcomed the administration’s action but voting rights advocates opposed it. The League of Women Voters accused the administration of “playing politics with our democracy and threatening the fundamental right to vote” by siding with an Ohio policy it said disenfranchises eligible voters. “Our democracy is stronger when more people have access to the ballot box - not fewer,” the Democratic National Committee added.  The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati last year blocked Ohio’s policy, ruling that it ran afoul of the 1993 law. The state appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed in May to hear the case.  The legal brief filed by the Justice Department said President Donald Trump’s administration had reconsidered the government’s stance and now supports Ohio. The brief, signed by Acting U.S. Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall, argued that Ohio’s policy is sound because it does not immediately remove voters from the rolls for failing to vote, but only triggers an address-verification procedure.  The American Civil Liberties Union last year sued Ohio Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted over the policy. The suit said the policy led to the removal of tens of thousands of people from the voter rolls in 2015. Husted said in a statement he welcomed the federal government’s support, noting Ohio’s policy “has been in place for more than two decades and administered the same way by both Republican and Democrat secretaries of state.” Under Ohio’s policy, if registered voters miss voting for two years, they are sent registration confirmation notices. If they do not respond and do not vote over the following four years, they are removed from the rolls. Ohio officials argue that canceling inactive voters helps keep voting rolls current, clearing out those who have moved away or died. Democrats have accused Republicans of taking steps at the state level, including laws imposing new requirements on voters such as presenting certain types of government-issued identification, intended to suppress the vote of groups who generally favor Democratic candidates.

South China Sea code of conduct talks to be 'stabilizer' for region: China premier,"MANILA (Reuters) - China s agreement to begin talks with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on the fine print of a code of conduct framework for the disputed South China Sea will help to stabilize the region, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said.  China s greatest hope is for peace and stability in the South China Sea,  Li told ASEAN leaders in Manila. The Chinese and Southeast Asian foreign ministers in August adopted a negotiating framework for a code of conduct in the South China Sea, a move they hailed as progress but seen by critics as a tactic to buy China time to consolidate its maritime power. While the South China Sea was not as dominant an issue at this summit at a time of relative calm, there was an underlying acknowledgement amongst ASEAN members that the risk of a miscalculation in the disputed waterway could flare up at anytime.       Li, addressing ASEAN leaders during a summit in the Philippines capital Manila on Monday, said there was a consensus on moving forward and to try to peacefully resolve the issue.  We hope the talks on the code of conduct will bolster mutual understanding and trust,  Li said, according to a transcript of his speech released by China s Foreign Ministry on Tuesday.  He added that he hoped this would be a  stabilizer  for the region, while pledging that China would  firmly safeguard  the freedom of navigation and overflight in the strategic waterway where $3 trillion worth of goods passes every year.  Critics, however, say the agreement to talk on the details of the code of conduct is only an incremental move, with a possible final agreement still years away.  While Li did not give a timeframe, Philippines  President Rodrigo Duterte, who was chairing the regional summit, said China was being pressed to set a specific date and that Beijing responded it would  consider really fast-tracking  the code of conduct.   China has graciously agreed to a code of conduct and it binds itself to the agreement,  Duterte said. The framework seeks to advance a 2002 Declaration of Conduct (DOC) of Parties in the South China Sea, which has mostly been ignored by claimant states, particularly China, which has built seven manmade islands in disputed waters, three of which are equipped with runways, surface-to-air missiles and radars. All parties say the framework is only an outline for how the code will be established but critics say the failure to outline as an initial objective the need to make the code legally binding and enforceable, or have a dispute resolution mechanism, raises doubts about how effective the pact will be.  Signing China up to a legally binding and enforceable code for the waterway has long been a goal for claimant members of ASEAN, some of which have sparred for years over what they see as China s disregard for their sovereign rights and its blocking of fishermen and energy exploration efforts. Malaysia, Taiwan, Brunei, Vietnam and the Philippines all claim some or all of the South China Sea and its myriad shoals, reefs and islands. China claims most of the waterway and has been aggressively building and militarizing artificial islands. China s official news agency Xinhua said in a commentary that the pact to hold consultations on the code of conduct was  a new starting point to jointly build a sea of peace, stability and prosperity .

Hong Kong seeks law banning booing of China's national anthem,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong will try to enact a law penalizing people who boo the Chinese national anthem  as soon as possible , an official said on Wednesday, in a move that critics say undermines the Chinese-ruled city s autonomy and freedoms. In the past few years, some Hong Kong football fans have booed the national anthem during World Cup qualifiers and other games, mirroring a more recent protest in the United States with football players kneeling during the national anthem, a practice  denounced by U.S. President Donald Trump. The Asian Football Confederation warned the Hong Kong Football Association on Tuesday over the conduct of fans who booed the Chinese national anthem in a match in October. China has passed a law stating that disrespecting the anthem could result in imprisonment. The law has come into force in China but has yet to be extended to Hong Kong.  Hong Kong Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Patrick Nip said the city had a constitutional obligation to follow up the move by China s largely rubber-stamp parliament. The law will now be added to the annex of Hong Kong s mini-constitution, the Basic Law, and put to the city s 70-strong legislature.  We will do it as soon as possible,  Nip told lawmakers, while saying there would be a consultation process. Hong Kong is a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a so-called  one country, two systems  formula that promises the city a high degree of autonomy, including an independent judiciary. China s growing reach into Hong Kong s affairs has, however, stoked tensions and mass protests including the 2014  Occupy  civil disobedience movement that blocked major roads in the city for 79 days to pressure China to allow full democracy. Nip said no decision had been made on jail terms, but the government would make reference to existing laws concerning the desecration of China s national flag that carry a maximum sentence of three years. Some critics said this move would further erode Hong Kong s autonomy and was another instance of China s tightening iron grip.   If a country (China) wasn t using totalitarian and autocratic ways to make people feel under pressure, I believe many more Hong Kong people would respect the national anthem,  said Dennis Kwok, a lawmaker with the Civic Party. Over the past few years, Hong Kong fans have booed the national anthem at several football matches involving the Hong Kong team, with an upcoming Asian Cup qualifier between Hong Kong and Lebanon another potential flashpoint.

Chinese authorities have strived to instill greater patriotism into Hong Kong, while condemning a push from democracy activists to distance Hong Kong from Beijing by embracing the city s culture and core values, with some even advocating independence from China.

Penguin Random House lands book deal with Obamas,"(Reuters) - Penguin Random House has landed a deal to publish two forthcoming books by former U.S. President Barack Obama and the former first lady, Michelle Obama, with one volume to be written by each, the publishing company said on Tuesday. Terms of the agreement, in which Penguin Random House acquired worldwide publication rights for the two books, were not disclosed. But in keeping with their past practice, the Obamas plan to donate a “significant portion of their author proceeds to charity,” including the Obama Foundation, the publisher said in a statement. The deal followed a heated auction for global rights to the two books with bidding that reached more than $60 million, a record sum for U.S. presidential memoirs, the Financial Times reported, citing people with knowledge of the sales process. By comparison, fellow Democrat and former President Bill Clinton earned $15 million for rights to his 2004 memoir “My Life” after he left office, while Obama’s immediate predecessor, Republican George W. Bush, reaped some $10 million from his book “Decision Points,” according to the Financial Times. Those books were published by Penguin Random House division Knopf and by Crown, respectively.  Penguin Random House also published Obama’s three previous books — “Dreams of My Father,” “The Audacity of Hope,” “Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters.”   The company did not disclose the subject matter of the two forthcoming books, or a time frame for them to be published, but they will presumably cover Obama’s time in the White House as the first African-American U.S. president. Among other publishers that bid on Obama deal were HarperCollins, a unit of News Corp, and Simon & Schuster, owned by CBS Corp, the Financial Times said. ",politicsNews,"March 1, 2017 ",0

Pakistan says over 300 Baloch separatist militants surrender,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - More than 300 Baloch separatist militants have surrendered over the past few months, Pakistani government officials said, after a ceremony to mark the downing of guns and militants  return to civilian life. The surrenders are part of government efforts to end a decade-long insurgency in the southwestern Baluchistan province by offering amnesties and financial rewards to soldiers and commanders to help them re-integrate into the society. In a high-profile ceremony on the lawn of the Baluchistan provincial assembly in the western city of Quetta, the regional capital, some 313 militants from three separatist movements handed over weapons to Nawab Sanaullah Zehri, the Chief Minister of the province.  I will hug all that who believe in integrity and sovereignty of Pakistan but will not tolerate (those) who will challenge the writ of the State,  Zehri said at the ceremony on Saturday. Pakistani government officials say about 2,000 militants have surrendered over the past 18 months. In April, the government held a similar ceremony where about 400 militants handed over their guns. The latest ceremony saw surrenders by 143 militants from the Baloch Republican Army (BRA), 125 fighters from the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and 17 from Baloch Liberation Front (BLF), according to officials. Under the agreement, foot soldiers are given 500,000 rupees ($4,700) and the top-level commanders receive about 1 million rupees ($9,500) to help them and their families build a life after militancy.     Baluchistan s government and the powerful army, which has a huge say in the running of Pakistan s poorest province, tout the amnesties as an effective way to reduce the power of separatists who accuse Islamabad of exploiting Baluchistan. While security has improved in Baluchistan over the past few years, critics and human rights groups say the army has crushed dissent and free speech, while separatists accuse security officials of extra-judicial killings and enforced disappearances. The military denies abuse claims. Pakistan s desire to dismantle the insurgencies has grown in urgency amid vast Chinese investment from Beijing s Belt and Road infrastructure splurge. China has frequently urged Pakistan to improve security, especially in Baluchistan. A new transport corridor (CPEC) through Baluchistan, linking Western China with Pakistan s Arabian Sea port of Gwadar, is due to become operational in late 2018.  Separatists have vowed to disrupt CPEC, and earlier this week China warned its citizens of a security threat inside Pakistan. ",worldnews,"December 10, 2017 ",0
REVEALED: HOW BARACK OBAMA IS FUNDING The “Resistance” Movement Against President Trump,"Wall Street might be shocked to learn it is helping bankroll the anti-Trump  resistance  movement that s aggressively fighting policies it favors   including corporate tax cuts and the repeal of Obama-era banking and health-care regulations.The payola is potentially earmarked for third-party interest groups approved by the Justice Department and HUD without requiring any proof of how the funds will be spent. Many of the recipients so far are radical leftist organizations who solicited the settlement cash from the administration even though they were not parties to the lawsuits, records show. During the Obama administration, groups committed to  revolutionary social change  sent proposals and met with high-level HUD and Justice Department officials to try to get their pieces of the settlement pie,  Cause of Action Institute vice president Julie Smith told The Post.Some of the chosen beneficiaries are now actively militating against the Trump administration and its policies, including:The Hispanic-rights group strenuously protested the Republican-led  skinny  repeal of the Affordable Care Act after receiving at least $1.5 million from the Obama regime s bank settlement funds, congressional researchers say.La Raza works closely with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and has teamed up with the anti-Trump resistance group, Indivisible, which was co-founded by La Raza alumnus Angel Padilla. Indivisible is working with La Raza and its affiliates to make sure  any bill that punishes sanctuary cities never goes to Trump s desk to become law.  They are encouraging activists to send postcards with pre-printed messages on immigration and health care to moderate GOP senators.NATIONAL URBAN LEAGUEAfter receiving at least $1.2 million from the bank-settlement slush fund, the African-American advocacy group solicited its supporters to oppose efforts to repeal ObamaCare by signing a letter to senators arguing  African-Americans stand to be disproportionately impacted.  It claimed more than 5 million black people would lose coverage under repeal legislation.NATIONAL COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT COALITIONSince hauling in at least $2.6 million in funds under settlement in the Obama-era mortgage suits, the liberal housing-rights group has slammed tax-reform proposals by the Trump administration as unfair, while trying to block efforts to privatize mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, claiming doing so would  deepen the racial wealth gap. NCRC is also actively lobbying against regulatory repeal of many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.The Washington-based group boasts more than 600 member organizations who lobby lawmakers through list-serves, mailings, sign-on letters and conference calls. Though it s assumed that funds distributed to such  qualified organizations  will be used for housing assistance, the bank-settlement agreements do not enforce how the funds are spent. It stands to reason that some of the settlement funds have helped bankroll the resistance  bent on stopping the Trump agenda for America, Competitive Enterprise Institute senior fellow John Berlau said.It s not clear how much money, in all, has been diverted from settlement funds to these and other left-wing organizations. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered a full audit of the funds while discontinuing the practice of funneling Justice Department settlements to third-party groups. Any settlement funds should go first to the victims and then to the American people [through the US Treasury]   not to bankroll third-party special interest groups or the political friends of whoever is in power,  Sessions said in a recent statement.Still, The Post has learned that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau continues to force financial institutions it prosecutes to donate to third-party community organizers. More, penalties in such cases are deposited into the Bureau s now-$170 million-plus Civil Penalty Fund, which has, in turn, channeled almost $30 million to  consumer advocacy  groups.For entire story: NYP ",left-news,"Sep 24, 2017",1

 New Poll Paints A HUMILIATING Picture For Trump Just One Month Into His Presidency,"As Trump prepares to kick off his 2020 campaign so he can avoid doing real work in the White House, a new poll has devastating news for him: If the 2020 election were held tomorrow, a generic, unnamed Democrat would beat him. That means that more people would vote for pretty much any Democrat in order to keep Trump from being re-elected.The Politico/Morning Consult poll has 43 percent of respondents saying they would probably pick the Democrat even without a name right now. Only 35 percent said they would vote for Trump.Worse, the number of Trump voters who would vote for him again is slipping. 71 percent of Trump voters said they d vote for him again, compared to 87 percent of Hillary s voters who would vote for the generic Democrat.And perhaps even worse than that is the fact that 26 percent of people who answered this poll believe Trump is the worst president we ve had since WWII. 25 percent hold that same opinion of Obama, but Trump s presidency is all of one month old. Obama served his eight years and has a legacy for people to look at.It s really not often that people believe history will view a president that badly just thirty days into his first term.For Trump, where his image and ego are everything, the idea that people would rather support a generic someone over him has got to be horrifying. This is a poll he would probably call  fake news,  because of the people who line the streets outside Mar a Lago (who are protesters), and all the electoral votes he won, and so on.Add all of this to the fact that he really is planning a campaign event in Florida for this weekend, and has declared himself eligible for candidacy for 2020 already, and what it shows right now is that people believe he can t do the job. Presidents often enjoy a certain  honeymoon  period with both the press and the populace following their election. Trump has been screwing up so badly so quickly that his honeymoon didn t even happen.The only people who still think he s doing a good job are his most ardent supporters. But those people would support him even if he nuked the U.S. back into the Stone Age.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"February 15, 2017",1
Trump expected to delay U.S. embassy move to Jerusalem: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is expected this week to delay relocating the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, U.S. officials and a diplomatic source said on Wednesday, despite his campaign pledge to go ahead with the controversial move. With a deadline for a decision looming, Trump is likely to  continue his predecessors’ policy of signing a six-month waiver overriding a 1995 law requiring that the embassy be transferred to Jerusalem, an action that would have complicated his efforts to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, the sources said. Trump has yet to make his decision official but is required by law to act by Friday, according to one U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Barring a last-minute surprise, Trump is expected to renew the waiver. His administration intends to make clear, however, that Trump remains committed to the promise he made during the 2016 presidential campaign, though it will not set a specific timetable for doing so, officials said. Asked whether Trump would sign the waiver, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters on Wednesday: “Once we have a decision, we’ll put it out,” adding there would be “something very soon on that.” While there have been divisions among Trump’s aides on the issue, the view that appears to have prevailed is that the United States should keep the embassy in Tel Aviv for now to avoid angering the Palestinians, Arab governments and Western allies while the president seeks to nurture peace efforts. Trump avoided any public mention of a potential embassy move during his visit to Israel and the West Bank in May. Despite that, most experts are skeptical of Trump’s chances for achieving a peace deal that eluded other U.S. presidents. The status of Jerusalem is one of the major stumbling blocks. Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem during the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it, a move not recognized internationally. Israel considers all of the city its indivisible capital. PRO-ISRAEL RHETORIC The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. Jerusalem is home to holy sites of the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions. Shifting the U.S. Embassy would be widely seen as Washington’s recognition of the Israeli position on Jerusalem’s status, which successive U.S. administrations have said must be decided in negotiations between the two sides. Former President Barack Obama renewed the waiver in December, setting off a six-month clock for Trump. CNN was first to report that Trump was expected to sign the waiver. On the campaign trail, Trump’s pro-Israel rhetoric raised expectations that he would act quickly to move the embassy. But after he took office in January, the issue lost momentum as he met Arab leaders who warned it would be hard to rejuvenate long-stalled peace efforts unless he acted as a fair mediator. Some of Trump’s top aides have pushed for him to keep his campaign promise, not only because it would be welcomed by most Israelis but to satisfy the pro-Israel, right-wing base that helped him win the presidency. The State Department, however recommended against an embassy move, one U.S. official said. “The president is still committed to moving the embassy,” one U.S. official said. “It’s not a question of whether but when it will be done.” The Jerusalem Embassy Act passed by Congress in 1995 mandating relocation of embassy to Jerusalem allows the president to waive the requirement in accordance with U.S. national security interests.

ISLAMIC TERRORIST ORGANIZATION Joins Obama And Friends To Condemn Trump’s ‘No New Muslim Immigrants’ Position,"What does Obama, the Democrat Party, the state-run media and faux conservatives in Congress all have in common with Hamas? They all want to take down Trump TEL AVIV   Palestinian terrorist organizations did not take kindly to Donald Trump s call for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country s representatives can figure out what is going on. Responding to Trump s proposal, Ismail Radwan, a Hamas leader and spokesman in Gaza, told Breitbart Jerusalem:  We do not estimate that the current U.S. administration, any administration, will implement these racist suggestions. This is a pathetic attempt to attribute terror exclusively to Muslims. Radwan, whose group s charter calls for the murder of Jews and the destruction of Israel, lectured Trump:  Islam is a religion of peace, a religion which opposes bloodshed. Radwan glossed over Hamas  own long and sordid history of bloodshed in the name of Islam, including thousands of terrorist attacks that have killed hundreds of Israelis. Hamas has been responsible for suicide bombings, shootings, and rocket attacks targeting Israeli neighborhoods.Abu al-Ayna al-Ansari, a senior Salafi jihadist in the Gaza Strip, also sounded off to Breitbart Jerusalem on Trump s remarks.Supporters might argue that Trump s shutdown could stop future terrorist attacks. Ansari, however, claimed that, because of leaders like Trump,  the American people are risking more terrorist attacks from our brothers, fighters of the Islamic State. We Muslims have grown used to these types of statements, which prove that the U.S. under any president will continue to be hostile towards Muslims,  added Ansari.The jihadist went on to claim that Trump s sentiments exposed the  truth  about American leaders.  They claim to stand for human rights, while in actuality they carry out the same policy as that of the infidel crusading West, which oppresses the Muslims. Trump should know that a new generation of Muslims has risen, a generation that is capable of handling people like him and countries like the U.S.,  Ansari added.Speaking on ABC s  Good Morning America  on Tuesday, Trump clarified that under his proposal American Muslims can come and go as they please.Trump expressed his hopes that a shutdown  will go quickly,  as soon as  our leaders figure out what the hell is going on. If a person is a Muslim, goes overseas and comes back, they can come back. They re a citizen. That s different,  Trump explained.  But we have to figure things out. Speaking on CNN on Tuesday, Trump warned that the country risks more terrorist attacks if his plan for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration is not implemented. You re going to have many more World Trade Centers if you don t solve it   many, many more and probably beyond the World Trade Center,  Trump told CNN s Chris Cuomo.Trump speculated that there are already terrorists inside the country.  They want our buildings to come down; they want our cities to be crushed.   They are living within our country. And many of them want to come from outside our country. In a statement released to reporters on Monday, Trump cited a poll from the Center for Security Policy showing that segments of the Muslim population hold anti-American views.According to Pew Research, among others, there is great hatred toward Americans by large segments of the Muslim population. Most recently, a poll from the Center for Security Policy released data showing  25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad  and 51% of those polled  agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Shariah. Trump urged Americans to better understand the ideology of radical Islam before allowing Muslims into the country. Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension. Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine. Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life.

Trump urges adding anti-Obamacare provision to tax bill: lawmaker,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing Republicans to change their tax-cut bill to include a repeal of the Obamacare mandate that requires individuals to buy health insurance or pay a fine, the House of Representative’s top tax lawmaker said on Friday. House tax committee Chairman Kevin Brady said he has asked the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to assess Trump’s suggestion and indicated some lawmakers were considering it. Other lawmakers have expressed concern. They said adding such a divisive provision would expose the tax bill to the fierce opposition that doomed Republicans’ efforts in July to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. The act was former President Barack Obama’s biggest domestic achievement. It raised taxes on wealthier Americans to fund healthcare benefits for middle- and low-income people, extending coverage to millions of previously uninsured. Democrats have defended it for years from attacks by Republicans, who see it as Washington intruding on Americans’ healthcare. Since Trump took power in January, he has pressed hard to undo much of Obama’s work. So far he has not secured any major legislative accomplishments in Congress, even though Republicans control both the House and the Senate. “The president feels very strongly about including this (the individual mandate repeal) at some step before the final process. He’s told me that twice by phone and once in person,” Brady told an event hosted by the news outlet Politico. “No decisions have been made ... Importing healthcare into a tax reform debate has consequences,” Brady said. Trump broached his idea in a tweet earlier this week, saying it would be “great” to repeal the mandate “and use those savings for further tax cuts.” Some Republican senators, such as Tom Cotton and Rand Paul, also favor this idea. Representative Tom Cole, a senior House Republican, said Friday that adding on a mandate repeal could cost the tax bill votes. “I don’t want to overload the vehicle,” Cole told reporters, adding that including the mandate repeal would probably be a “deal breaker” for Democrats. Brady also said Friday he would offer “substantive improvements” to the tax bill when his committee begins considering the legislation next week. He gave no details. The tax bill released Thursday would cut tax rates for businesses, individuals and families. Republicans hope to pass it through Congress by year’s end. Democrats oppose it as a give-away to the rich and large corporations. ",politicsNews,"November 3, 2017 ",0
Spicer says he let Trump down with comments comparing Assad and Hitler,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Wednesday he had let down President Donald Trump with his “inexcusable and reprehensible” comments comparing the use of poison gas by Syria’s president to the atrocities of Adolf Hitler. “I made a mistake. There’s no other way to say it. I got into a topic that I shouldn’t have and I screwed up,” Spicer said during an event at a museum in Washington. “On both a personal level and a professional level that will definitely go down as not a very good day in my history,” he added. Spicer triggered an uproar at a White House briefing on Tuesday while discussing chemical weapons use by the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, saying that even Hitler did not use chemical weapons during World War Two. The comments drew sharp criticism on social media and elsewhere for overlooking the fact that the Nazis killed  millions of Jews and others in gas chambers. Eighty-seven people, including children, were killed in last week’s chemical weapons attack in Syria.  Offered a chance to clarify his remarks during Tuesday’s briefing, Spicer attempted to draw a distinction between the two different uses of deadly chemicals. Later on Tuesday, he apologized for his handling of the topic, which came on the Jewish holiday of Passover and as Christians prepare to celebrate Easter. On Wednesday, Spicer said the comments were “inexcusable and reprehensible” and all the more painful because they were made at a time sacred to Jews and Christians. He said it also was disappointing from a professional standpoint, especially after what he said were “an unbelievable couple of weeks” of Trump’s presidency. He noted that Trump had bombed a Syrian air base in a forceful response to chemical weapons use by Assad’s government and said Trump’s hosting of Chinese President Xi Jinping last week had produced “tremendous progress.” “Your job as the spokesperson is to help amplify the president’s actions and accomplishments,” Spicer said. “And when you’re distracting from that message of accomplishment ... it’s disappointing because I think I’ve let the president down.” ",politicsNews,"April 12, 2017 ",0

Senator Flake expects more Republicans to denounce Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Jeff Flake said on Wednesday he expects more  Republican colleagues to speak out against Donald Trump’s behavior and policies, one day after denouncing the Republican president in a fiery speech. Flake had accused Trump of “reckless, outrageous and undignified” behavior and said his “instinct to scapegoat and belittle threatens to turn us into a fearful, backward-looking people.” His condemnation in a speech on the Senate floor came just hours after Senator Bob Corker, another Republican, lashed out at Trump as “an utterly untruthful president” who was debasing the United States. Flake, who is not seeking re-election in Arizona next year, said on Wednesday he thinks other Republican lawmakers will join him in standing up to Trump. “Privately a number of my colleagues have expressed concern about the direction of our politics and the behavior of the president,” Flake told CNN. “There comes a tipping point where you realize we just can’t continue to normalize this kind of behavior so I do think we’ll have more people stand up in the coming months.” Trump responded by saying Flake’s feud with him probably would have cost him with voters and that he would have lost if he had sought re-election. “He was against me before he ever knew me,” Trump told reporters on Wednesday. “He would have never won. He did the smart thing for himself. This way he can get out somewhat gracefully.” Despite control of the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives, Republicans have yet to deliver any major legislative victories this year on priorities such as tax reform, healthcare and immigration. Republican Senator John McCain, who is fighting brain cancer, also has spoken out sharply against Trump.  But most Republicans in Congress have either remained silent or tried to play down divisions inside their party as Trump has attacked lawmakers, the media and others he sees as opposing or trying to undermine his presidency. “I think people should settle their differences personally,” Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. “I think it’s better that way. I think it’s in our interest to have party unity so that we can continue to work forward on an agenda.” So far, the fierce criticism from Flake and Corker has drawn more praise from Democrats than from fellow Republicans. “History will judge Senator Flake and Senator Corker as two men of the greatest conscience to have graced this chamber on either side of the aisle in a long time,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said.

JetBlue offers $99 flights out of Florida ahead of Hurricane Irma,"(Reuters) - JetBlue Airways Corp is offering $99 direct flights from every Florida city where it operates, the airline said on Wednesday, as people hurry to leave before powerful Hurricane Irma hits the state. A price cap through Sept. 10 is also in place for all of JetBlue s Florida connecting flights, a maximum fare of $159 up to the last available seat, the company said.  We want those trying to leave ahead of the hurricane to focus on their safe evacuation rather than worry about the cost of flights,  JetBlue spokesman Doug McGraw said. Flights in the eastern Caribbean through Sept. 7 and in the western Caribbean through Sept. 8 are also under a fare ceiling. Florida remained under a state of emergency as Irma, packing winds of up to 185 miles per hour (295 km per hour), tracked across the northern Caribbean on a path expected to hit  landfall in the United States over the weekend. Airlines have been criticized for raising prices in the wake of deadly episodes such as a 2015 Amtrak derailment, but U.S. officials said last year they found no evidence of wrongdoing in that instance.  Irma s arrival marks the second time in as many weeks U.S. airline operations will be disrupted by a powerful storm.  Last week, Category 4 Hurricane Harvey landed in Texas and swallowed up much of Houston with powerful winds and deadly flooding. Airline operations were crippled for several days as airports closed, forcing thousands of flight cancellations. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",0
"Factbox: Five facts about Tom Cotton, Trump's likely pick for CIA","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Tom Cotton, a hawkish Iraq war veteran who has said he did not consider waterboarding to be torture, is likely to be chosen by President Donald Trump as the next leader of the Central Intelligence Agency amid a Cabinet shake-up, senior administration officials said. Here are five facts about the Arkansas Republican: - Cotton, 40, is a staunch Trump ally who has vigorously opposed the Iran nuclear deal. He served one term in the House of Representatives before being elected to the Senate in 2014 as part of a Republican wave. Cotton sits on the Intelligence Committee but has no experience managing a large organization. - Cotton has given a qualified endorsement of the intelligence community’s assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to boost Trump’s prospects. “I have no doubts about the intelligence community’s assessment,” he said in an Oct. 5 interview with Washington Post columnist David Ignatius.  - Cotton wants to boost the defense budget, saying the U.S. military is in crisis, and has pointed to both Russia and China as growing threats. He accused Moscow of trying to divide NATO and said China was “seeking control over the Pacific Rim.”  - A decorated Army veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Cotton appeared to align himself with Trump’s support of waterboarding, saying he did not consider it torture. “Waterboarding isn’t torture. We do waterboarding on our own soldiers in the military,” the former paratrooper told CNN in November 2016. Waterboarding, the practice of pouring water over someone’s face to simulate drowning as an interrogation tactic, was banned by Democratic President Barack Obama days after he took office in 2009. - Cotton is a graduate of Harvard University and Harvard Law School. A father of two, he has a reputation as a devoted family man who once apologized for being late for an intelligence hearing because he was tending to a baby in his office.

House overwhelmingly backs NATO mutual defense,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to reaffirm the NATO alliance’s guarantee that all members defend each other, weeks after President Donald Trump raised doubts about Washington’s support for the agreement. The vote was 423-4 in the House, where Trump’s fellow Republicans hold a 48-seat majority, for a resolution “solemnly reaffirming” the U.S. commitment to Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. It also supports calls for every NATO member to spend at least 2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense by 2024.  During a visit to NATO headquarters in Brussels in May that was part of his first overseas trip, Trump pointedly did not mention U.S. support for that critical portion of the NATO charter, rattling allies. Instead, he used a speech there to demand that member states pay more for the alliance’s defense. Trump later said he backed the mutual defense agreement, and other senior officials rushed to express U.S. support. “With all the threats we and our partners face around the globe, a strong and secure NATO is more important than ever before,” Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement. The resolution was co-sponsored by Ryan and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, as well as the number two Republican and Democrat in the chamber, and the Republican chairman and the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

DECLASSIFIED US INTEL REPORT Used To Discredit Trump Is Huge Embarrassment…Evidence Was Compiled In 2012 After OBAMA’S Reelection,"A highly-anticipated declassified US intelligence report, aimed to prove that Russia supported Donald Trump, has turned out to be a huge embarrassment. The annex that contained factual material that was thought to provide evidence of RT influencing the American public was compiled in December 2012, right after the reelection of Barack Obama.The report focuses on television shows and interviews that took place four years before Trump was elected, and well before he was even a politician. In Annex A of the report, intelligence agencies claim that  Kremlin s TV Seeks To Influence Politics, Fuel Discontent in US.  Buried at the bottom of that page is a note stating,  This annex was originally published on 11 December 2012 by the Open Source Center, now the Open Source Enterprise. The report notes that two RT shows, Breaking the Set and Truthseeker, focused on criticism of US. The problem is, both of these shows were off air before the 2016 election season began.The report goes on to detail programming in 2012 about voting booth irregularities, which, again, would have been during Obama s campaign. Despite being an old report, the topic became largely relevant once again during the Democratic primaries when voters found themselves purged from voting rolls, and hundreds of thousands of ballots went uncounted.Perhaps most shocking of all, the dastardly RT network dared to host third party debates, as they were not allowed participation in the main debates.  In an effort to highlight the alleged  lack of democracy  in the United States, RT broadcast, hosted, and advertised third party candidate debates and ran reporting supportive of the political agenda of these candidates. The RT hosts asserted that the US two-party system does not represent the views of at least one-third of the population and is a sham.  Apparently, the intelligence communities do not agree that some of the people they serve may not fit perfectly into the two neat and tidy political boxes of Republicans and Democrats. The report states that the network aired a documentary on Occupy Wall Street, an obviously left-wing movement, in 2012. Again, this was the year Obama was elected, so perhaps the Russians actually won HIM the presidency. They presented evidence that Russian media often reports on infringements of civil liberties, police brutality, and drone use. While these issues are all popular topics of discussion in left-leaning media, RT s reporting in 2012 was clearly part of a long-running plot to elect Trump, right?If the report is true and RT the Almighty was swinging votes in 2012, the only beneficiary of the coverage was the now-outgoing president of the United States, who won a landslide victory over Republican Mitt Romney. Four years ago Trump was not thought of as a politician and it remains a mystery how RT s 2012 coverage could propel him. A mystery, that even a classified version of the report would have a hard time explaining.    Sputnik news ",politics,"Jan 7, 2017",1
"U.S., Japan first ladies: both unconventional yet poles apart","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Japanese first lady Akie Abe made her rounds in Washington on Friday, noticeably absent was the high-level chaperone of previous visits - America’s first lady. Rather than Melania Trump, it was the wife of the Japanese ambassador to the United States who accompanied Akie Abe on a visit to a local university, a Japanese embassy official said. That was a departure from Akie Abe’s previous visits to Washington. In 2007, she was treated to a tour with Laura Bush to George Washington’s home, Mount Vernon, and in 2015, she and Michelle Obama stopped by a northern Virginia elementary school with a Japanese immersion program. The break with convention, three weeks into husband Donald Trump’s presidency, is another sign that Melania Trump may have different designs on the first lady’s role than her predecessors.    Melania Trump has elected to stay in New York for now while her son finishes his school year. It is not yet clear if she will take a prominent role in White House social events, including accompanying fellow first ladies on their visits to the capital.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife are scheduled to spend the weekend at the Trumps’ Florida Mar-a-Lago retreat, where the two leaders will golf and the task of hosting Mrs. Abe will fall to Melania. While their husbands strive to appear in lock-step on U.S.-Japan relations this weekend, Melania Trump may find in her Japanese counterpart someone who is in many ways her opposite - a political spouse who does not shun the limelight and disagrees publicly with her powerful husband. Melania Trump, a former model from Slovenia, rarely airs differences of opinion with her husband. Akie Abe, in contrast, has used news interviews to make policy recommendations for his administration, leading some to dub her the “household opposition.”  She told Reuters in 2014 that Japan should consider cutting spending and boosting the economy before further raising the sales tax, to 10 percent. She said she had urged her husband not to go forward with the first stage of the rise, to 8 percent, to no avail.  Critiquing Japan’s male-dominated professional culture, Akie Abe told Bloomberg last year that Japanese women are held back by pressure from men to be “cute” rather than “capable and hardworking.” Her public profile makes her a rarity in Japan as well as a stark contrast with Melania Trump, who largely avoided the campaign trail, has not shown deep interest in public policy, and has rarely disagreed with Trump in public despite some damaging revelations. When a videotape of Trump emerged during the 2016 presidential campaign in which he boasted about grabbing women by their genitals, Melania said in a brief statement that his words were “unacceptable and offensive” but that she had accepted his apology.     The differing styles could keep the weekend conversations on the light side. “I would certainly expect no discussion of global politics” between Melania and Akie, said Jean Harris, a University of Scranton professor who has studied the role of first ladies. “I don’t see Melania as wanting to be part of those conversations.” Akie Abe’s openness in stating points of disagreement with her husband has few parallels even in American politics, where first ladies tend not to diverge from their husbands in public, though they may be crucial advisors behind the scenes, Harris said. Just after the election, Melania Trump said in a CBS interview that she chides her husband “all the time” for his Twitter attacks. “Sometimes he listens, sometimes he doesn’t,” she said. “I give him my opinion. And he could do whatever he likes with it.” ",politicsNews,"February 10, 2017 ",0
ATHEISTS SUE GOVERNOR OF TEXAS Over Display on Capitol Grounds," I m convinced the Freedom From Religion group of atheists didn t get enough attention when they were kids. They re perpetually offended by just about everything. Here s yet another case of them mocking a nativity scene with a childish display and then suing the Texas governor when he took it down.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is being sued by an atheist group over his decision to remove its nativity-scene parody from the state Capitol in December.The Freedom From Religion Foundation announced a federal lawsuit against Abbott in the Western District of Texas, Austin division, on Thursday. The organization alleges the governor violated free speech, equal protection and due process rights when he ordered the removal of an  exhibit  commemorating the  birth  of the Bill of Rights.The image in question, approved by Texas  State Preservation Board, included the Statue of Liberty, the Founding Fathers and the Bill of Rights in a manger. It was placed in the state Capitol Dec. 18, 2015, and remained there for three days before Abbott acted. Mocking the Capitol nativity scene is offensive. I demand the removal of the satirical  nativity scene  from Capitol,  Abbott tweeted Dec. 22, 2015.The governor also penned a letter to the State Preservation Board: This juvenile parody violates the Preservation Board s regulations and should be removed immediately.   The biblical scene of the newly born Jesus Christ lying in a manger in Bethlehem lies at the very heart of the Christian faith. Subjecting an image held sacred by millions of Texans to the Foundation s tasteless sarcasm does nothing to promote morals and the general welfare,  Abbott said.  To the contrary, the Foundation s spiteful message is intentionally designed to belittle and offend, which undermines rather than promotes any public purpose a display promoting the Bill of Rights might otherwise have had.

"Factbox: Sweeping U.S. Dodd-Frank financial law created new agencies, rules","(Reuters) - The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, named for former Democratic lawmakers Senator Chris Dodd and Representative Barney Frank, was signed by former President Barack Obama in 2010 as a response to the financial crisis. Dodd-Frank is the most sweeping financial regulatory statute enacted since the response to the Great Depression in the 1930s. It created new regulatory bodies and directed already-existing agencies to write hundreds of regulations aimed at creating stability in the financial markets. Republican lawmakers, including President Donald Trump, have said that Dodd-Frank is burdensome for financial institutions, and many seek to repeal it in whole or part. Trump signed an executive order on Friday that did not mention Dodd-Frank by name. But White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters on Friday, “Dodd-Frank is a disastrous policy that’s hindering our markets” and the order would be the first step taken to review the law. Here are some of the Dodd-Frank law’s main provisions: The Financial Stability Oversight Council Dodd-Frank created the FSOC to monitor risk in the financial system and it was granted the power to deem institutions, including non-bank firms such as asset managers and insurance companies “systemically important financial institutions.” These firms are often called “too-big-to-fail” and subject to additional capital requirements. The Office of Financial Research Dodd-Frank created the independent Office of Financial Research within the Treasury Department to provide data and support related to risks in the financial system to relevant government agencies, including the FSOC. This data is used in part to assess whether a firm is a systemically important financial institution. Consumer Financial Protection Board Dodd-Frank created the CFPB, a federal agency that oversees consumer protection in the financial sector, including banks, payday lenders, credit unions, mortgage servicers and other companies. A federal appeals court ruled in October that the bureau’s structure is unconstitutional because its director, currently Richard Cordray, cannot be removed by the president without cause. That ruling was stayed and has not taken effect pending appeal. Volcker Rule A portion of Dodd-Frank known named for former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker prohibits commercial banks from also engaging in proprietary trading and restricts them from investing in hedge and private equity funds. The Volcker Rule also limits the liabilities that can be taken on by the country’s largest banks. The rule was delayed several times and took effect in July 2015. Some large Wall Street banks asked the Federal Reserve to grant them an additional five-year grace period to comply with the rule. Capital Requirements The law’s so-called capital requirements forced banks to fund themselves more by raising money from shareholders than by borrowing. Regulators used a variety of requirements to force banks to cut their reliance on debt, including by imposing tougher rules for riskier assets. The most stringent requirements fell on the biggest banks. Banks say the process has been costly.  Living Wills Dodd-Frank required banks with assets of $50 billion or more to submit living wills to regulators. A bank’s living will is a kind of prepackaged bankruptcy plan that will guide its dissolution and liquidation without taxpayer assistance should it collapse. If these living wills are deemed insufficient by regulators, institutions get another chance to submit a new plan. At that point, if regulators again deem a living will insufficient, a bank can face sanctions.    Swaps Push-Out Rule The initial swaps proposal prohibited banks active in swaps markets from receiving federal assistance. The rule was narrowed to apply to only swaps entities. A swaps entity is a swap dealer that is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or Securities and Exchange Commission. The rule does not apply to depository banks that have swaps divisions, which remain eligible to be insured by the federal government. Regulated Institutions A number of Dodd-Frank’s provisions were designed to direct agencies to regulate entities such as private equity funds and hedge funds for the first time. It also required a brand new regulatory regime for over-the-counter derivatives, which imposed capital and margin requirements, central clearing and trading transparency rules on the marketplace.

SHOCKING VIDEO CONNECTS BEYONCÉ And OBAMA TO DALLAS COP KILLER,"Because Bob Price at Breitbart News had the courage to attend and film an unbelievable Black Panther rally aimed at threatening cops in Houston last year, America was able to see just exactly how hateful and dangerous this group really is. Obama s celebrity bestie, Beyonc promoted the Black Panthers to a staggering 114.4 MILLION viewers in her anti-cop, anti-white performance during her Super Bowl 2016 halftime act. Her over-the-top performance included Black Panther clad dancers who proudly displayed the divisive black power fist.The mainstream media ignored her hateful performance. Impressionable young Americans who ve been watching Obama s race war unfold didn t.  Beyonc wasn t promoting the Girl Scouts of America, she was promoting a HATE group who openly vocalizes their desire to KILL COPS! Thanks to Bob Price, we now know the Dallas cop killer was part of that group.Only hours before the Dallas cop killer took the lives of 5 innocent American law enforcement officers, Beyonc posted this rant to her website:Dallas cop killer Micah X. Johnson was a member of the radical, violent Black Panthers, the same group that Beyonce promoted at the 2016 Super Bowl. Our current  President  marched with them in 2007. Obama s AG, Eric Holder gave them a pass, after they were caught in the act of blatantly intimidating voters during the 2008 election. Micah X. Johnson was a member of the Houston New Black Panther Party for a short period of time. He was reported to be a member for about six months a few years ago.Quanell X told reporters at KPRC NBC2 in Houston that Johnson was a member of the Houston Chapter of the New Black Panther Party for a short time a few years ago. He said he parted ways with Johnson after about six months because Johnson would not follow the chain of command.During negotiations with the Dallas Police Department Friday morning during the ambush shooting that left five officers dead and seven other people shot, Johnson said he was not part of any group. He stated he wanted to kill white people and white police officers.WATCH this shocking video showing the Black Panthers (including Dallas cop murderer) openly calling for the killing of cops: Breitbart Texas was present at an armed march carried out by the Houston New Black Panther Party in Waller County last summer. This writer took photos and video of the armed marchers at that time.

WNDIt should come as no surprise to anyone that Beyonc  has endorsed the pandering Hillary Clinton. Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton paid a  surprise visit  to Beyonc  during last week s fundraising trip to Los Angeles.

Trump issues first public condemnation of anti-Semitic incidents,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump delivered his first public condemnation of anti-Semitic incidents in the United States on Tuesday after a new spate of bomb threats to Jewish community centers around the country and vandalism in a Jewish cemetery. Several of the centers were evacuated for a time on Monday after receiving the threats, the JCC Association of North America said, and another center was evacuated on Tuesday morning in San Diego, California, according to police. Also, vandals toppled about 170 headstones at the Chesed Shel Emeth Society cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri, over the weekend. “The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil,” Trump told reporters.  He was speaking at the end of a tour of the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, which Trump said showed “why we have to fight bigotry, intolerance and hatred in all of its very ugly forms.” The comments marked a change for Trump, who had not explicitly and publicly condemned the threats against Jews when asked last week. Instead, he spoke more generally about his hopes of making the nation less “divided.” The president reacted with anger at a news conference last week when a journalist from a Jewish magazine asked how his government planned to “take care” of a rise in threats. Trump berated the reporter for asking a “very insulting” question, appearing to believe the reporter was accusing him of being anti-Semitic. “Number one, I am the least anti-Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life,” the president said, adding that he was also the least racist person. Trump has often noted that one of his daughters is a convert to Judaism, he has Jewish grandchildren and he employs many Jews in his business.  Trump’s daughter Ivanka, a close adviser to her father who practices Orthodox Judaism, responded to the latest threats in a message on her Twitter account on Monday evening. “America is a nation built on the principle of religious tolerance,” she said. “We must protect our houses of worship & religious centers.”   On Tuesday, Trump again declined to answer a question about what action he would take to address the threats to Jewish organizations. Sean Spicer, a White House spokesman, said later that Trump would respond through “deed and action” over the coming months and years. ‘BAND-AID’  Trump’s derogatory campaign rhetoric against Muslims and Mexican immigrants won enthusiastic backing from prominent white supremacists who embrace anti-Jewish, anti-black and anti-Muslim ideologies. It also drew greater media attention to fringe extremist groups.  Trump has disavowed their support. His chief strategist, Steve Bannon, is the former publisher of Breitbart, a news website popular among right-wing extremist groups. The Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect in New York, which has criticized the Trump administration repeatedly over anti-Semitism, said his comments were too little too late. “The president’s sudden acknowledgement is a Band-Aid on the cancer of anti-Semitism that has infected his own administration,” Steven Goldstein, the group’s executive director, said in a statement. Spicer rejected the characterization. “I wish that they had praised the president for his leadership in this area,” he told reporters when asked about Goldstein’s comment. “Hopefully as time goes by they’ll recognize his commitment to civil rights.” Jewish groups criticized the White House for omitting any mention of Jews in its statement marking Holocaust Memorial Day last month. The White House said the omission was deliberate since the Nazis also killed people who were not Jews, if in smaller numbers. The stated goal of the Nazis was the extermination of Jews. One day after speaking at a security summit in Munich, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence spent Sunday morning walking through the grounds of the Dachau concentration camp in Germany with a camp survivor.  Over the course of the U.S. Presidents Day holiday on Monday, bomb threats were sent to 11 Jewish community centers, including ones in the Houston, Chicago and Milwaukee areas, according to the JCC association. They were found to be hoaxes, as was another threat that forced the evacuation of a center in San Diego on Tuesday morning, according to police. No arrests were made. The FBI has said it is investigating recent threats as “possible civil rights violations.” The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a prominent Muslim human rights group, has offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of anyone behind the threats, saying Muslims felt a duty to support any targeted minority group. The incidents on Monday followed three waves of bomb threats so far this year. In all, at least 69 incidents at 54 Jewish community centers in 27 states and one Canadian province have been reported, according to the JCC association. ",politicsNews,"February 21, 2017 ",0
REVEALED: How Democratic Party pays Agit-Prop ‘Protesters’ to incite violence at Trump events," By Anthony Brian Logan . James O Keefe of Project Veritas has released undercover, button-camera video that outlines the process of bird-dogging and how it is being used to rig the 2016 Presidential election of the United States in favor of Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party. The central focus of the video, which is a collection of various undercover videos with commentary, is the process of  bird-dogging  which refers to essentially hiring people to behave as the equivalent to crisis actors. Except for the fact that there is no actual crisis, and these people are used to simply incite violence, among other things, to goad the media into giving Donald Trump s campaign negative coverage.Various people appear in the video, complete with both audio and video, saying how they skirt the laws of our nation to engage in corruption. Hillary Clinton s campaign is not allowed to directly collude with the phony actors on the ground, so they use degrees of separation by hiring consultants. These consultants then go on to sub contract work  on the ground  such as the actors who engage in fake riots and protests.

The former San Francisco 49ers quarterback drew nationwide attention last year when he knelt during the national anthem to protest police brutality in America.In September, 2016, the union for police officers who work San Francisco home games threatened a boycott of policing the stadium after the 49ers refused to discipline Colin Kaepernick for not standing during the national anthem and for his statements about law enforcement.

The board of directors of the Santa Clara Police Officer s Association has a duty to protect its members and work to make all of their working environments free of harassing behavior. It also criticized what it called anti-police statements made by Kaepernick, calling them  insulting, inaccurate and completely unsupported by any facts. Edwards arranged for the donation of a jersey and other equipment to the Smithsonian, but did so with a request.  I said,  Don t wait 50 years to try to get some memorabilia and so forth on Kaepernick,  Edwards said, according to USA Today.  Let me give you a game jersey, some shoes, a picture.   And it should be put right there alongside Muhammad Ali. He s this generation s Ali. Daily Wire   Adopted by white parents in Wisconsin, Kaepernick is the biological child of a white woman and a black man. He was born in 1987.Kaepernick explained his refusal to stand for the Star-Spangled Banner, expressing solidarity with the net-marxist racial narratives of Black Lives Matter: I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder. Kaepernick describes himself as a black man in a society that  oppresses black people. Kaepernick s refusal to stand for our national anthem was considered anything but brave by many of his fans. Here s a picture of a fan burning Colin s jersey, a trend that was started shortly after Kaepernick used his position to promote the violent Black Lives Matter movement on the field as the other players honored our nation:Kaepernick remains unsigned even as players like Ryan Fitzpatrick sign deals, and there is, of course, the question of how much his very public and very controversial political stances may be harming his marketability.

"North Korea moving airplanes, boosting defense after U.S. bomber flight: Yonhap","SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea has been moving airplanes and boosting defenses on its east coast after the United States dispatched B-1B bombers to the Korean peninsula over the weekend, South Korea s Yonhap News Agency reported on Tuesday, citing the country s spy agency.  The United States seemed to have disclosed the flight route of the bombers intentionally because North Korea seemed to be unaware, the report said. South Korea s National Intelligence Service was unable to confirm the report immediately. North Korea s foreign minister said on Monday that U.S. President Donald Trump had declared war on North Korea and that Pyongyang reserved the right to take countermeasures, including shooting down U.S. bombers even if they are not in its air space.

THE TRUTH ABOUT Phony Global Warming: Why Our Snake-Oil-Salesman-In-Chief Is So Desperate To Sell Americans On This LIE," No challenge  poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.    Obama State Of The Union speech, 2015There is a very good reason why the Left is now SHAMING anyone who doesn t believe in the phony  science  of global warming. In what amounts to essentially a money laundering scheme, the campaigns of some of the most dishonest politicians in Washington are being funded by the business owners who are hand-selected by those crooked politicians to receive billions for  global climate change  initiatives.The liberal media machine has spent decades bulldozing anyone who tells you global warming is a sham.They even came up with a clever little title    deniers. Every time a heat wave hits, every time a picture of a lone polar bear gets taken . . . the left pounds the table for environmental reform, more policy, more money to combat climate change. But how much has the world really warmed?Their message is simple: Get on the man-made global warming bandwagon . . . or you re just ignorant.But how much has the world really warmed?It s an important question, considering the U.S. government spends $22 billion a year to fight the global warming crisis (twice as much as it spends protecting our border).To put that in perspective, that is $41,856 every minute going to global warming initiatives.But that s just the tip of a gargantuan iceberg.According to Forbes columnist Larry Bell, the ripple effect of global warming initiatives actually costs Americans $1.75 trillion . . . every year.That s three times larger than the entire U.S. federal budget deficit.So, has anyone stopped to ask . . . how much has the globe actually warmed?Well, we asked, and what we found was striking.According to NASA s own data via Remote Sensing Systems(RSS), the world has warmed a mere .36 degrees Fahrenheit over the last 35 years (they started measuring the data in 1979).Hardly anything to panic about; however, that does mean the world is warmer, right?The problem with that argument is that we experienced the bulk of that warming between 1979 and 1998 . . . since then, we ve actually had temperatures DROPPING!As can be seen in this chart, we haven t seen any global warming for 17 years.Weakening the global warming argument is data showing that the North Polar ice cap is increasing in size. Recent satellite images from NASA actually reflect an increase of 43% to 63%.This is quite the opposite of what the global warming faction warned us.In 2007, while accepting his Nobel Prize for his global warming initiative, Al Gore made this striking prediction,  The North Polar ice cap is falling off a cliff. It could be completely gone in summer in as little as seven years. Seven years from now. Al Gore could not have been more wrong.However, despite this clear evidence that the temperatures are not increasing, the global warming hysteria only seems to be increasing.For example: President Obama himself tweeted on May 16, 2014:  97% of scientists agree: climate change is real, man-made and dangerous.  John Kerry, Al Gore, and a host of others have championed this statistic.Since then, it has become clear that this statistic was inaccurate.The Wall Street Journal went as far as to say,  The assertion that 97% of scientists believe that climate change is a man-made, urgent problem is a fiction.  Forbes headlined  Global Warming Alarmists Caught Doctoring  97% Consensus  Claims. Come to find out, the study President Obama was citing was botched from the start.A host of other problems for the global warming crowd are emerging, such as . . .Leaked emails from global warming scientists state that the Earth is not warming, such as this one from Kevin Trenberth that states,  The fact is that we can t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty we can t. Claude Allegre, the founding father of the man-made global warming ethos, recently renounced his position that man has caused warming.Proof is emerging that Al Gore and even President Obama have financially benefited from fueling the global warming hysteria (click here for an internal report on this).It is becoming harder and harder for the global warming community to ignore some of the scientific data that show the Earth is not getting warmer . . . instead, the world is getting cooler.Which makes one wonder   why are we still spending $22 billion a year on global warming initiatives, and where is the money going? Global warming  has been kept on life support for another crucial reason: It has been a practical ATM for every in-the-know political figure.Al Gore, for example, has been one of the most vocally aggressive crusaders for  global warming. In 2001, before leaving office as vice president, Gore was worth less than $2 million. Since then, he has grown his wealth to $100 million . . . almost entirely by investing in a handful of  green-tech  companies . . . 14 of which received more than $2.5 billion in loans, grants, tax breaks, and more from the Obama administration.The Telegraph reports Al Gore could become the  world s first carbon billionaire  thanks to his investments in green companies . . . all of which benefit from tax dollars and government loans to  prevent global warming. And he s not alone.You are likely familiar with the story of the failed Solyndra green energy initiative, which cost taxpayers $500 million; President Obama took a lot of flak for that.But here s a little-known side of the Solyndra story I bet you haven t heard: Obama, in essence, used taxpayer money to finance his re-election campaign . . . by funneling it through Solyndra.You see, when Solyndra fell on hard times, it passed into the hands of two large private equity investors . . . Goldman Sachs and George Kaiser. When $500 million in taxpayer money was given to Solyndra, both Goldman Sachs and George Kaiser benefited. Coincidentally, both have made contributions to Obama s election campaigns adding up to roughly $1.25 million.It doesn t stop there.In 2010, another federal loan of $400 million went Abound Solar. That resulted in a bankruptcy as well. But investors in Abound Solar seemed to do just fine . . . investors like billionaire heiress Patricia Stryker. Stryker has famously contributed $500,000 to the Coalition for Progress while throwing $85,000 toward Obama s inaugural committee. It s just a coincidence that the government handed a company she invested in $400 million just before bankruptcy . . . right?There s also A123 Systems, which paid one lobbying firm $970,000 to secure money from the government   and received $279 million in federal assistance. The CEO of A123 Systems went on to fund multiple Democratic senators and contributed to Obama s campaign.First Solar received $646 million in government loan guarantees, and has since contributed more than $180,000 to Democratic campaigns.GE is notorious for spending tens of millions of dollars a year to  buy  green energy credits for its wind turbines and other green technologies   credits which helped the firm pay ZERO taxes in 2011.There are a host of other examples of liberals getting wealthy off  global warming  initiatives just like these.You can see why green energy is such a profitable business   CEOs and executives get to rake in millions of dollars, while politicians get lucrative donations for their campaigns . . . and scientists get all the funding they need to keep them going . . . all on your dime.But here s the cherry on top . . .While $22 billion of our money is being redistributed every year to greedy scientists, politicians, and corporations . . .$22 billion is just what is spent on these  global warming  initiatives.The reality is, these initiatives have ripple effects . . . mainly the regulations (from government agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency) that shackle free enterprise and force us to rely on foreign energy.According to Forbes, the total cost of these ripple effects is a staggering $1.75 trillion annually.I want you to really think about that for a moment.We re watching $1.75 trillion per year . . . $3,329,528 per minute . . . go to waste.It s worse when you note that the U.S. Energy Information Administration says these regulations could ultimately cause gasoline prices to rise 77% over baseline projections . . . send 3 million Americans to the welfare line . . . and reduce average household income by a whopping $4,000 each year.Washington knows all of this . . . and is still barreling forward with its nonsense policies!They re just letting you foot the bill, while they pocket the benefits. Climate change is no longer some far-off problem; it is happening here, it is happening now.  Fact is, organizations like the Environmental Protection Agency have handcuffed capitalism . . . based on a theory even its staunchest supporters have already renounced.The result: reduced business, higher energy and food costs, higher taxes, lost jobs, and more money going overseas.For entire story: NewsMax ",politics,"May 12, 2016",1

U.S. judge unlikely to remove block on Trump sanctuary city order,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday said he was “very much inclined” to maintain a court order that blocks President Donald Trump’s administration from carrying out a policy designed to threaten federal funds to so-called sanctuary cities. At a hearing in San Francisco federal court, U.S. District Judge William Orrick III said a recent memo from the Justice Department that appeared to narrow the scope of Trump’s executive order on sanctuary cities did not remove the need for an injunction. Trump issued the order in January directing that funding be slashed to all jurisdictions that refuse to comply with a statute that requires local governments to share information with immigration authorities. Sanctuary cities generally offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to enforce of federal immigration laws. Dozens of local governments and cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, have joined the growing “sanctuary” movement. The Trump administration contends that local authorities endanger public safety when they decline to hand over for deportation illegal immigrants arrested for crimes. The Republican president’s moves to crack down on immigration have galvanized legal advocacy groups, along with Democratic city and state governments, to oppose them in court.  After Trump issued the sanctuary cities executive order earlier this year, Santa Clara County - which includes the city of San Jose and several smaller Silicon Valley communities - sued, saying it was unconstitutional. San Francisco filed a similar lawsuit. In a ruling in April, Orrick said Trump’s order targeted broad categories of federal funding for sanctuary governments and that plaintiffs challenging the order were likely to succeed in proving it unconstitutional. Attorney General Jeff Sessions then issued a memo which formally endorsed a narrower interpretation of Trump’s order, saying that the only funds the government intended to withhold were certain grants tied to law enforcement programs. In court on Wednesday, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate said the Sessions memo meant less than a million dollars were now at risk for Santa Clara County and San Francisco, so the injunction was no longer needed. But Orrick said an injunction was still necessary because Trump could always order Sessions to issue new, broader guidance. “The attorney general still has the ability to change that memo,” Orrick said. The judge said he would also likely reject a Justice Department request to dismiss other claims by Santa Clara and San Francisco.       ",politicsNews,"July 12, 2017 ",0

"Qatar must protect workers from lethal heat, rights group says","DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar must do more to protect construction workers from heat which often reaches levels that are potentially fatal, Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday. HRW and other rights campaigners are frequent critics of Qatar s treatment of migrant laborers whose working conditions have received additional scrutiny as the country prepares to host the 2022 World Cup. The group said existing regulations only set limits on outdoor work during the period June 15 to Aug. 31, and then only from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.   Climate data shows that weather conditions in Qatar outside those hours and dates frequently reach levels that can result in potentially fatal heat-related illnesses in the absence of appropriate rest,  it said. HRW called authorities also to investigate the causes of migrant worker deaths and publish data on such incidents. In 2013, health authorities reported 520 deaths of workers from Bangladesh, India, and Nepal, HRW said.  Like other wealthy Gulf Arab states, Qatar relies on vast numbers of migrant workers, mostly from the Philippines, South Asia and Africa. Around 2 million migrant workers live in Qatar, outnumbering the local workforce by nearly 20 to one. Some 800,000 work in the construction sector. Unions and labor protests are banned and authorities penalize dissent with jail or deportation. The Qatari government s Communications Office said:  Qatar is committed to its labor reform program and is constantly reviewing its policies to ensure that migrant workers receive the necessary on-site protections.  We continue to coordinate closely with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and international NGOs to implement reforms that will improve the health, safety and rights of migrant workers,  Sheikh Saif Al Thani, head of the Communications Office, said in a statement sent to Reuters.

Obama's prisoner clemency plan faltering as cases pile up,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In April 2014, the administration of President Barack Obama announced the most ambitious clemency program in 40 years, inviting thousands of jailed drug offenders and other convicts to seek early release and urging lawyers across the country to take on their cases. Nearly two years later the program is struggling under a deluge of unprocessed cases, sparking concern within the administration and among justice reform advocates over the fate of what was meant to be legacy-defining achievement for Obama. More than 8,000 cases out of more than 44,000 federal inmates who applied have yet to make it to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for review, lawyers involved in the program told Reuters. That is in addition to about 9,000 cases that are still pending at the DOJ, according to the department’s own figures. Only 187 inmates have had their sentences commuted, far below the thousands expected by justice reform advocates and a tiny fraction of the 2.2 million people behind bars in the United States, which has the world’s highest incarceration rate. The administration said it wanted to decide on all the applications before Obama’s term ends next January, when the program will automatically expire.  A senior DOJ official told Reuters it is calling on the lawyers’ group — Clemency Project 2014 — to simply hand over the outstanding cases without further vetting, saying it is not working fast enough. So far, the group estimates it has handed over around 200 cases. But criminal justice experts say the administration itself should bear much of the blame. The idea to tap pro-bono attorneys to help vet the cases originated with the DOJ, and critics say it should have prepared its own staff to handle the large volume of applications. “It’s unfair to criticize the volunteer group that you asked to help,” said Rachel Barkow, a criminal law professor at New York University who has studied clemency in U.S. prisons. She estimates that about 1,500 prisoners should be eligible for commutation, saying the 187 granted so far does not “fulfill the promise of the program.”  The DOJ declined to comment when asked for its response to such criticism. The delays have left prisoners like Linda Byrnes, 69, in limbo. “I thought clemency was for people like me,” Byrnes told Reuters through an electronic messaging system from a federal prison in Alderson, West Virginia. Byrnes, who has spent 20 years in prison for distributing marijuana and has two years left on her sentence, was recently diagnosed with mouth cancer and has yet to hear whether she has been assigned a lawyer after submitting her application to Clemency Project in August 2014. Obama, who has commuted more sentences than the past five presidents combined, has been a stern critic of harsh U.S. sentencing policies that he says have disproportionately burdened minorities. Federal life sentences have fallen since Obama took office, from 280 in fiscal year 2009 to 153 in 2013, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission. About three quarters of the sentences were given to minorities and most were for non-violent offences, the report said. Clemency Project 2014 said it does not comment publicly on the individuals it represents. The group vets the applications, writes the petitions and sends them to the Justice Department’s Office of the Pardon Attorney, which oversees all pardons and sentence commutations and makes recommendations for the president’s approval.  So far, 25,000 of 34,000 applications received by Clemency Project have been rejected for failing to meet the basic criteria - no record of violence, no significant ties to a gang or drug cartel, good behavior in prison and completion of at least 10 years of sentence. About 10,000 inmates did not go through the Clemency Project and either applied directly to DOJ or through a paid attorney.  “It really would be a sad state of affairs if individuals who had asked for a lawyer weren’t considered in time because their petitions never reached the pardon attorney’s office,” a DOJ official told Reuters on the condition of anonymity. (Graphic on the clemency bottleneck: tmsnrt.rs/1VThxVT) A large number of mostly unqualified applications, a shortage of lawyers and the complexity of the cases have slowed progress, said Cynthia Roseberry, project manager for Clemency Project 2014. “There are a lot of gray areas,” said Roseberry, who estimates it takes 30 days for one lawyer to review one case on average. “We’ve got to unpack each of these applicants to see specifically what factors affect them... and so that takes a little more time.” This includes finding pre-sentencing reports for each case, determining if the person would have received a shorter sentence under current law and reviewing prison behavior records. Roseberry said the group was unaware of any request from the Justice Department to hand over the pending applications. Roseberry said the group’s initially slow pace has picked up in recent months.  The Justice Department declined to elaborate on its private communication with the lawyers. The Pardon Attorney’s office has brought in personnel from other parts of the department to help to speed up reviews of petitions, the DOJ official said. Roseberry said about 3,000 applicants still need to be assigned to a lawyer, and that it was not certain whether the group will be able to submit all of the applications it has received before Obama leaves office.  The group has more than 570 law firms and 30 law schools contributing to the effort. Some rejected prisoners and those who have yet to hear a decision say they believe they would have had a better chance if they had sent their clemency petition directly to the government. Josie Ledezma was sentenced to life for conspiracy to transport cocaine and applied for clemency through Clemency Project 2014. She said she did not hear from them for six months and later learned that her assigned lawyer had shut down her legal practice. In January, nearly one year after applying, she was told Clemency Project 2014 could not help her and encouraged her to apply directly. “I wrote back and asked what was it that made me not qualify, but never got a response,” Ledezma told Reuters through an electronic messaging service for federal prisoners.

Only 48% of voters say that they would be opposed to Trump s impeachment.Beyond a significant percentage of voters already thinking that Trump should be removed from office, it hasn t taken long for voters to miss the good old days of Barack Obama 52% say they d rather Obama was President, to only 43% who are glad Trump is. President Obama was loved by the United States, and for as many haters as there were, there were far more that loved and appreciated his true leadership and love of country over himself. The same can t be said of Trump.Check out this tweet that garnered over 1.6 million likes:It's been the honor of my life to serve you. You made me a better leader and a better man.  President Obama (@POTUS44) January 20, 2017And then this one:I won't stop; I'll be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by your voices of truth and justice, good humor, and love.  President Obama (@POTUS44) January 20, 2017The man isn t only loved, he s beloved.Trump, on the other hand, throws out mean revenge tweets like their going out of style. And most of the responses to his tweets are condemning his actions. To be blunt   the man is not liked much at all. Sure, he has he band of merry minions who would likely drink paint if Trump told them to, but he lost the popular vote by 3 million vote to Hillary Clinton. And the only reason he is president is due to an archaic Electoral College that was devised to give power to slave owners who counted their slaves as 3/5 of a person, and help those in rural communities have a voice. It s no longer needed and the nation doesn t want Trump nor his backhanded style of egomaniacal leadership.It seems, if given the opportunity, the United States would have President Obama back in a heartbeat. If only that were possible.Featured Photo by Alex Wong, Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"February 2, 2017",1
 Racist Hacker Remotely Controlled College Printers To Spread Anti-Jew Propaganda,"Last week, printers at colleges across the country suddenly started spitting out fliers advocating white supremacy and Antisemitism. The headline of the flier was  White man are you sick and tired of the Jews destroying your country through mass immigration and degeneracy?  And it went downhill from there.On Monday, a white supremacist hacker claimed responsibility for the mass hack:PRINCETON, N.J.   A well-known computer hacker who goes by the name of  Weev  said he was behind a wave of anti-Semitic, racist fliers that appeared on printers at more than a dozen college campuses last week. Weev is the alias of Andrew Auernheimer, who in 2010 was part of a group of hackers that discovered a security loophole on AT&T s servers and gained access to the data of 114,000 customers. Mr. Auernheimer was initially convicted of identity fraud and conspiracy to access a computer without authorization, but his conviction was overturned on appeal.It s not clear that  Weev  even broke any laws since all of the printers he accessed were open to remote printing and were not protected by a password.Although  Weev  did not mention Donald Trump, it s not much of a stretch to assume he s a big fan. While the white supremacy movement has always been lurking in the shadows, Trump s candidacy has emboldened it to crawl out into the light. With millions of people no longer ashamed to be openly racist, the ranks of the KKK and Neo-Nazi groups have swelled, giving them and people like  Weev  the confidence to publicly tout their hatred of Those People:The fliers directed readers to The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website. Mr. Auernheimer said free speech concerns were behind his printing spree.  My motivation is this: White cultures and only white cultures are subject to an invasion of foreigners. The  threat  to  white culture  that he s referring to is the loss of white privilege. This is truly a terrifying concept to people who think white people are inherently superior but refuse to compete on a level playing field. It s also the fear that minorities, once in power and no longer minorities, will treat white people the way white people have treated them for centuries.We should expect to see more (a lot more) racist propaganda being disseminated by bigots who honestly think their time has come again.Featured image via nbcphiladelphia.com",News,"March 29, 2016",1

"OBAMA’S ARMY: BLACK LIVES MATTER TERRORIST SHOUTS, “Burn Everything Down” IN LARGE ACTIVIST MEETING, AS CO-FOUNDER CHEERS [VIDEO]","And why is this person not up on domestic terrorism charges? Can you imagine a white person being caught on camera making such claims in a crowded room of white racists? Lorretta Lynch s DOJ would have already descended on them if the color of their skin was anything but black. We are witnessing something very ugly taking place in America, orchestrated by a man the majority of Americans voted for as their two-term president, because they actually believed he would make our country even better In rarely seen angle on the Black Lives Matter mob takeover of a NetRoots Nation Presidential Town Hall last weekend in Phoenix, Arizona, activists from the group scream explicit calls for violence and chaos, using an Occupy Wall Street style call-and-response technique to advocate  burn everything down,   shut this shit down,  and  rise the f*ck up. By the way, it s worth mentioning that spineless, pandering Democrat presidential candidate Martin O Malley was on the stage witnessing this whole scene unfold. Does anyone remember O Malley apologizing to the crowd following this event for having the audacity to say:  All lives matter ?The shouted manifesto lays bare the theory behind the burning, looting, and rioting that have transpired in recent months in Baltimore and Ferguson, and it also lays out the group s agenda on current news events like immigration reform, transgender activism, and the fables about the death of convicted criminal Sandra Bland that the group is spreading through the media.The nascent Black Lives Matter movement cannot claim that these statements were made by a few fringe members: the entire rant was orchestrated by Black Lives Matter Founder Patrisee Cullors, who can be seen in the video enthusiastically pumping her fist and shouting along with every incendiary statement.Nor is Black Lives Matter a fringe group; they have been embraced and given fealty by the highest levels of the Democratic power structure. Cullors told a British interviewer,  We re going into halls of power now. Many of us are meeting with mayors or meeting with local government. Some of us have met with President Obama himself to talk about the demands. Ms. Cullors  name appears on White House visitor records.Last week, Breitbart News exposed that convicted cop killer Assata Shakur is one of the heroes of the Black Lives Matter founders. Black Lives Matter pays homage to Cuban exile Shakur and quotes the Communist Manifesto at every single Black Lives Matter event.In one of the only cases of any coverage of the Black Lives Matter shrieks of angry poety at Netroots, CNN glossed over some of the crowd s chants in their reporting, but just as they did with Occupy movement, most of mainstream media has completely ignored the radical and revolutionary agenda revealed in Black Liver Matter s scripted call-and-response at NetRoots Nation. Even though the horde of screamers is surrounded by cameras, there has been no public criticism of Cullors and her folloers shouting  burn everything down,  nor any calls for her to apologize for her group s offensive statements.That media fail is unfortunate, because every American should hear who Black Lives Matter is, what they stand for and what they want, in the group s own words.Guided Transcript of What Black Lives Matter Said The group starts by pointing out that both leftist journalists like CNN s openly gay Don Lemon and mainstream racer baiting Democrats like the Reverend Al Sharpton and Rev. Jesse Jackson are actually too moderate for them:If I die in police custody do not let my parents talk to Don Lemon, Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson or any of the motherfuckers that would destroy my name. Let them know that my sisters got this.Then another activist links the group with the LGBTQ political left. Black Lives Matter was founded by Cullors and two other women who self-identify as queer.The speaker makes reference to being called by  the name I choose, not the name I was given ; a familiar demand for anyone who has followed the recent Bruce  Caitlyn  Jenner controversy.If I die in police custody say my name, say my name  the name that I chose, not the one I was given. If I die in police custody make sure that I m remembered. Make sure my sisters are remembered. Say their names. Say their names. Marsha P. Johnson. [Unintelligible] Say their names! Say that Black Lives Matter! Black Lives Matter!https://youtu.be/raK8kI7oKW0Marsha P. Johnson is name used by Malcolm Michaels, Jr., a New York drag queen who died in 1992 in a death ruled a suicide. Johnson / Michaels was not in police custody.The group then turns to its pro-illegal immigration position. Two of Black Lives Matter s founders head up pro-Illegal alien groups.If I die in ICE custody say I am not a criminal. Stop funding prisons and detention centers! Shut ICE down and (unintelligible) jails and our prisons! Not one more deportation!The line about ending all deportations got huge applause and cheers from the Netroots.The group then begins to turn their screeched narrative into an emotional and paranoid attack on white people. In strident language, they shout their fear that  white supremacy  wants to kill black Americans en masse.If I die in police custody, know your silence helped kill me. White sumprecacy helped kill me. And my child is parentless now.If I die in police custody know that I want to live! We want to live! We fight to live! Black lives matter! All black lives matter!Then the mob makes a thinly veiled reference to Sandra Bland, a woman whose death the group has been exploiting and spreading false information and conspiracy theories about for several weeks.Bland s death in jail after she was arrested for assaulting a police officer was ruled a suicide, and an autopsy confirmed that suicide finding with physical evidence. The autopsy also revealed that Bland had a large amount of marijuana in her system.Additionally, Bland had made a previous suicide attempt, had spoken about depression in a video she d posted on social and during intake at the jail had written herself that she was  very depressed  that day. Further, Bland had had at least ten prior run-ins with law enforcement that had resulted in numerous conviction and over $7,500 in outstanding fines.Despite the mountain of evidence about Sandra Bland s sad history, the Black Lives Matter movement has continued to push the idea that Bland was an activist who was the victim of murder by the police. They push this narrative at Netroots with a series of calls to violent action:If I die in police custody don t believe the hype, I was murdered! Protect my family! Indict the system! Shut that shit down!If I die in police custody. Avenge my death! By any means necessary!If I die in police custody burn everything down! Because no building is worth more than my life! And that s the only way motherfuckers like you listen!If I die in police custody make sure I m the last person to die in police custody by any means necessary!If I die in police custody do not hold a moment of silence for me! Rise the fuck up! Because your silence is killing us!At this point, the group is interrupted by Netroots Nation official.As National Journal reported in a story that mentions none of these calls to violent action Netroots Nation itself announced plans to work with Black Lives Matter.For its part, Netroots declined to criticize the protest.  Although we wish the candidates had more time to respond to the issues, what happened today is reflective of an urgent moment that America is facing today,  the group said in a statement.  In 2016, we re heading to St. Louis. We plan to work with activists there just as we did in Phoenix with local leaders, including the #BlackLivesMatter movement, to amplify issues like racial profiling and police brutality in a major way. As the old song goes, see you in St. Louis. Bring a fire extinguisher.Via: Breitbart News",politics,"Jul 28, 2015",1
"GANGSTA GOV ATTEMPTS SHAKEDOWN OF GIANT MORTGAGE COMPANY, Quicken Loans…Owner Stands His Ground","Quicken Loans owner, Dan Gilbert is one of the most beloved business owners in the state of MI. Their headquarters are located in the city of Detroit (where people in the suburbs don t typically travel unless they have to). Owner, Dan Gilbert gives back to the city of Detroit and to its residents in a huge way, not the least of which is employing over 7,000 people in their Detroit offices. In 2014, Fortune Magazine named Quicken Loans a  Top 5 Place To Work  for the 11th straight year. When asked what made Quicken Loans such a great place to work, Fortune gave this answer: America s largest online-lending company offers cash incentives to its staff to move to downtown Detroit. According to Salary.com, mortgage bankers in Southeast Michigan average $50,000 a year, but those at Quicken earn $113,000. None of that matters to a corrupt government however, who has a history of shaking down banks. This time however, the goons in our Justice Department may have targeted the wrong business owner.Detroit s own Quicken Loans is the latest target of the Justice Department s shakedown of the nation s lenders.Justice s goons have been systematically extorting protection money from big banks and mortgage lenders, under the threat of federal fraud lawsuits and prison time for their executives.The department s modus operandi would be worthy of racketeering charges if carried out by civilian mobsters.First, the Obama administration whips up a blame-the-banks fervor after the financial collapse. Then, armed with federal fraud statutes adopted after the savings and loan meltdown in the 1980s, it scours the transactions of lenders to find hints of irregularities. It extrapolates from the skimpiest evidence a pattern of widespread abuse, and if needed, frightens insiders into coughing up creative accusations against their employers.With its  proof  in hand, Justice presents institutions with a choice   pay a large and painful fine to make the investigation go away, or try their luck at a jury trial in an environment in which the words  bankers  and  baby killers  register about the same revulsion.The nation s six largest banks have all crumbled, choosing to pay $136 billion in fines and admit their  wrongdoing  rather than get their legs broken.Quicken, owned by Dan Gilbert, has decided not to cower, at least for the moment. Instead of paying protection money, it filed a lawsuit to stop a three-year investigation. Thursday, the government responded by filing charges against Quicken, accusing it of submitting ineligible mortgages for FHA insurance.In its complaint, Quicken says Justice demanded a multi-billion dollar settlement based on a sampling of just 55 of the 246,000 loans issued. Defects, according to the lawsuit, include miscalculating a borrower s income by $17 and lending another $26 too much. In those meager mistakes, Justice sees systemic fraud.Trace evidence is all the Obama administration requires to put banks on the rack. To cinch a settlement, Justice adds the threat of criminal charges against individual executives.Quicken s lawsuit accuses the government of  investigating and pressuring large, high-profile lenders into paying nine- and 10-figure sums and publicly admitting wrongdoing, including conceding that the lenders had made false claims.  That s an exellent summary of Justice s racket.Requiring a public admission of wrongdoing, instead of allowing institutions to settle without acknowledging guilt, as is common practice, leaves open the possibility of future criminal action against executives, assuring that they don t squawk publicly.Gilbert is a different cat than Justice has crossed on Wall Street. Detroit street tough, he doesn t take to being bullied. Of course, the government has a lot of pressure points it can mash. Gilbert is in the gaming business, a highly regulated industry, and the administration is not above targeting his casinos.But I hope he hangs in there. This government has gone gangster, and unless someone takes a stand, it won t be just the big bankers who get pinched.Via: Nolan Finley, Detroit News",politics,"Apr 28, 2015",1
 Some Conservatives Hate Trump So Much They Are Praising President Obama’s DNC Convention Speech,"The same conservatives who have attacked President Obama over the last eight years really liked his speech on Wednesday night.When President Obama spoke in support of Hillary Clinton during the DNC Convention, he extended an olive branch to conservatives who are dissatisfied with Donald Trump as the Republican nominee. Look, we Democrats have always had plenty of differences with the Republican Party, and there s nothing wrong with that,  Obama said before reaching out to those who are #NeverTrump. It s precisely this contest of ideas that pushes our country forward. But what we heard in Cleveland last week wasn t particularly Republican   and it sure wasn t conservative. What we heard was a deeply pessimistic vision of a country where we turn against each other, and turn away from the rest of the world. There were no serious solutions to pressing problems   just the fanning of resentment, and blame, and anger, and hate. President Obama then stressed unity along with the themes of patriotism and our Founding Fathers. And he even mentioned Ronald Reagan. And that is not the America I know. The America I know is full of courage, and optimism, and ingenuity. The America I know is decent and generous I see Americans of every party, every background, every faith who believe that we are stronger together   black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American; young, old; gay, straight; men, women, folks with disabilities, all pledging allegiance, under the same proud flag, to this big, bold country that we love. Ronald Reagan called America  a shining city on a hill.  Donald Trump calls it  a divided crime scene  that only he can fix.The reason he ll lose it is because he s selling the American people short. We re not a fragile people. We re not a frightful people. Our power doesn t come from some self-declared savior promising that he alone can restore order as long as we do things his way. We don t look to be ruled. Our power comes from those immortal declarations first put to paper right here in Philadelphia all those years ago: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that We the People, can form a more perfect union. And because many Republicans are starting to wake up and realize what their own party has become, they praised President Obama s speech.National Review columnist Rich Lowery was stunned because he seems to think patriotism and the founding documents are trademarked Republican beliefs.American exceptionalism and greatness, shining city on hill, founding documents, etc they re trying to take all our stuff  Rich Lowry (@RichLowry) July 28, 2016Erick Erickson of Redstate couldn t believe how much he enjoyed it. I disagree with the President on so much policy and his agenda, but appreciate the hope and optimism in this speech.  Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) July 28, 2016The GOP offered a vision of doom, despair, and division. Tonight the President I think divides us offered optimism. I hate this year.  Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) July 28, 2016Republican strategist Rory Cooper thought the speech was  great  and slammed his own party for making it easy for Obama by nominating Trump. Great speech. And we made it easy for him.  Rory Cooper (@rorycooper) July 28, 2016This conservative was shocked to hear President Obama defend conservatives from Trump.Still stunned. Feel like I m in the twilight zone. Obama just defended America & conservative values from attacks by the Republican nominee.  (((AG))) (@AG_Conservative) July 28, 2016Jeb Bush campaign staffer Tim Miller said that Republicans just lost an entire generation of voters. Will a Trump apologist explain to me why an 18 yo watching the conventions would want to be a Republican? We re giving away a generation  Tim Miller (@Timodc) July 28, 2016Former Reagan speechwriter John Podhoretz appreciated the nod to his former boss.Take about five paragraphs out of that Obama speech and it could have been a Reagan speech. Trust me. I know.  John Podhoretz (@jpodhoretz) July 28, 2016While they praised President Obama s speech, they all still hate him and the progressive policies he supports. Of course, these Republicans conveniently ignore that many of the policies President Obama has pursued throughout his two terms were ideas that their party once supported, especially Obamacare. But the consensus is clear. Donald Trump preaches hate and division while President Obama delivered the speech Republicans only wish their nominee would have done. Thank God the President had the grace on that stage last night to point out that Donald Trump is neither a Republican nor a conservative,  Erick Erickson wrote on Thursday.  I am glad that even the President is not willing to tar and feather my party with Trump, despite my party s willingness to commit political suicide. Featured Image: Pete Sousa",News,"July 28, 2016",1
Austria's Freedom Party criticizes ECJ ruling on migrant quotas,"VIENNA (Reuters) - The leader of Austria s far-right Freedom Party (FPO) on Thursday criticized the European Union s top court for upholding Brussels  right to force member states to take in asylum-Seekers, calling the quota system an  immigration program . Heinz-Christian Strache, whose anti-immigrant party could become kingmaker in next month s parliamentary election, took sides with Hungary s Prime Minister Viktor Orban.   It simply cannot be that states lose their right to self-determination and decision-making when it comes to receiving (asylum-seekers),  Strache said in a panel discussion in Vienna. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) dismissed complaints by Hungary and Slovakia against the quota system on Wednesday. The European Commission said it might seek fines at the ECJ within weeks for Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic unless they take people from Italy and Greece.      The (EU) program is not a refugee program but an immigration program,  said Strache, who has repeatedly called for  zero and minus immigration .     The veteran party chief drew attention to remarks by U.N. peace talks mediator Staffan de Mistura.   The U.N. Special Representative pointed out the war in Syria is over,  Strache said.  We all know, asylum is a temporary protection, which applies for as long as there is persecution. But if that s no longer the case, one actually has to take care of going back home.  The Freedom Party s popularity rose to a high during Europe s migration crisis in 2015, when it denounced the government s decision to open Austria s borders to hundreds of thousands of migrants. It led polls for more than a year, until Sebastian Kurz took the helm of the conservative People s Party in May. Kurz, who also has a hard stance on migration, has been leading polls ahead of the Oct. 15 election with just over 30 percent. The Freedom Party and center-left Social Democrats trail with around 25 percent each. Austria s system of proportional representation is likely to produce another coalition government, and observers say Kurz s and Strache s parties are likely to join forces.

" White Supremacist Kills Black Man, Planned On Murdering More (VIDEO)","James Harris Jackson, 28, eventually surrendered to police in New York City to admit to fatally stabbing a 66-year-old black man in the chest with a 26-inch sword that has an 18-inch blade. The sword exited the victim s back after being plunged into his chest. Jackson, an army veteran from Baltimore, held a long-time hatred of black people and had traveled to Manhattan with the goal of killing black men.This is an attack you won t see amateur president Donald Trump tweeting about.Timothy Caughman, 66, the white supremacist s victim, stumbled into a police station bleeding from stab wounds to his chest and back, Assistant Chief William Aubry, the commander of Manhattan South detectives, told reporters at Police Headquarters, according to the New York Times.After taking down his first victim, Jackson set his sights on another black person just blocks away but something reportedly  spooked him. He appeared to be very close, following a black guy,  a source said.  He slows down and at one point he turned around and came back. It s clear he was really focused on the guy for some time. Then, he falls out of camera view and doesn t attack the guy. He made statements that he was following the guy but something spooked him. Jackson was arrested on a charge of second-degree murder, but the chief said they wanted to upgrade the charge by classifying it a hate crime.Watch:.@NYPDMTS walk James Harris Jackson, an army veteran & member of a hate group in Maryland, accused of killing a #NYC black man @NYDNVideo pic.twitter.com/DWwGxM0GgG  Edgar Sandoval (@edjsandoval) March 22, 2017Surveillance video of Jackson near the scene:Jackson admitted to police that he was a member of a white supremacist group and said that he detailed his racist views on his laptop computer, according to the Daily News.Jackson told the authorities that he initially wanted to stab a black man, then grab a police officer s gun and  shoot some people,  a police source said.Aubry said,  He wanted to make a statement.

House panel approves legislation to speed deployment of self-driving cars,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An influential U.S. House committee on Thursday approved a revised bipartisan bill on a 54-0 vote that would speed the deployment of self-driving cars without human controls and bar states from blocking autonomous vehicles. The bill would allow automakers to obtain exemptions to deploy up to 25,000 vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards in the first year, a cap that would rise to 100,000 vehicles annually over three years.  Automakers and technology companies believe chances are good Congress will approve legislation before year end. They have been pushing for regulations making it easier to deploy self-driving technology, while consumer groups have sought more safeguards. Current federal rules bar self-driving cars without human controls on U.S. roads and automakers think proposed state rules in California are too restrictive.  The measure, the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, would require automakers to submit safety assessment reports to regulators, but would not require pre-market approval of advanced vehicle technologies. The House of Representatives will take up the bill when it reconvenes in September, while senators plan to introduce a separate similar measure. “Our aim was to develop a regulatory structure that allows for industry to safely innovate with significant government oversight,” said Representative Greg Walden, who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Initially, authors proposed to allow automakers and others to sell up to 100,000 vehicles immediately. Representative Frank Pallone said the phase-in period was essential so “millions of exempted cars will not hit our roads all at once.” Manufacturers must demonstrate self-driving cars winning exemptions are at least as safe as existing vehicles. Under the House proposal, states could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but could not set self-driving car performance standards. Automakers praised committee passage, while Consumer Watchdog privacy director John Simpson said preempting state laws “leaves us at the mercy of manufacturers as they use our public highways as their private laboratories.” General Motors Co (GM.N), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and others have been lobbying for legislation to speed deployment of self-driving cars. Consumer advocates want more changes, including giving the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration quicker access to crash data and more funding to oversee self-driving cars. The issue has taken on new urgency since U.S. road deaths rose 7.7 percent in 2015, the highest annual jump since 1966. Automakers say that without changes in regulations, U.S. self-driving car testing could move to Europe and elsewhere. ",politicsNews,"July 27, 2017 ",0
Russia says satellite launch failure due to programming error,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said on Wednesday the failed launch of a 2.6 billion-rouble ($44.95 million) satellite last month was due to an embarrassing programming error. Russian space agency Roscosmos said last month it had lost contact with the newly-launched weather satellite - the Meteor-M - after it blasted off from Russia s new Vostochny cosmodrome in the Far East. Eighteen smaller satellites belonging to scientific, research and commercial companies from Russia, Norway, Sweden, the United States, Japan, Canada and Germany, were on board the same rocket. Speaking to Rossiya 24 state TV channel, Rogozin said the failure had been caused by human error.  The rocket carrying the satellites had been programmed with the wrong coordinates, he said, saying it had been given bearings for take-off from a different cosmodrome - Baikonur - which Moscow leases from Kazakhstan.  The rocket was really programmed as if it was taking off from Baikonur,  said Rogozin.  They didn t get the coordinates right.  The Vostochny spaceport, laid out in the thick taiga forest of the Amur Region, is the first civilian rocket launch site in Russia. In April last year, after delays and massive costs overruns, Russia launched its first rocket from Vostochny, a day after a technical glitch forced an embarrassing postponement of the event in the presence of President Vladimir Putin.

Mosley would have kept Ecclestone at F1 helm,"LONDON (Reuters) - Formula One’s new owners Liberty Media may have made a mistake  in ousting commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone immediately after completing their takeover of the sport, according to former FIA president Max Mosley. Ecclestone, 86, was replaced by American Chase Carey on Jan. 23 as chief executive of Formula One and appointed ‘Emeritus Chairman’ - a position without a clearly defined role for the Briton. Liberty have, however, said they hope Ecclestone will continue to offer advice to the board. “If it had been me in the case of Liberty, I’d have kept Bernie on to do the things that he’s superbly good at - such as dealing with the promoters and the organizers and all that side of it,” Mosley told Reuters. The Briton, a close ally of Ecclestone while running the governing body, said Liberty could have concentrated on “doing the things that up to now have not been done” in Formula One such as virtual reality and digital technology. “But of course they bought a business and are fully entitled to come in and think they can run the whole business better and we’ll just have to see what happens,” added the 76-year-old, speaking at F1’s annual Zoom charity auction on Friday night. Mosley, who stood down as president of the International Automobile Federation in 2009, cautioned against too much rapid change in the sport. Liberty have spoken about increasing the number of grands prix, particularly in the Americas, changing the weekend format and giving every round of the championship the ‘Super Bowl’ treatment. Carey, who has appointed former ESPN executive Sean Bratches to run the commercial side with former Mercedes principal Ross Brawn overseeing motorsport matters, has spoken of F1 being like ‘21 Super Bowls’ in a season. “You’ve always got to be careful, if it ain’t broke don’t fix it. But they are fully aware of that,” said Mosley. “They (Liberty) are serious business people. Whether they can deal with everything better than they could have dealt with it using Bernie for the things he’s good at, and then doing the things that they know about, is an open question. We shall see.” Mosley agreed that Liberty had plenty on their plate in the coming months and might find a few bumps in the road ahead despite their undoubted expertise. “It always looks easy from the outside,” he warned. “It’s like if I think I could go and fix horse racing. But if you actually go and try and do it, you find there are a whole mass of problems you never even knew about. But maybe they will be very successful and get the job done.” With Super Bowl 51 coming up in Houston on Sunday, Mosley was also wary of comparisons between how the National Football League spectacular is presented over the course of a week and grand prix racing. “I think that’s easy to say, it’s not quite clear to me what that means,” he said of the suggestion that every race could be treated like a Super Bowl, with more razzamatazz and events leading up to it. “But the Super Bowl...is that so wonderful? I don’t want to be unkind, but Americans always think they can do everything better than anybody else. And they’re not always right as a lot of recent history shows.” ",politicsNews,"February 4, 2017 ",0
Putin offers transcript to prove Trump did not pass Russia secrets,"SOCHI/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump had not divulged any secrets during a meeting in Washington with Russian officials and offered to prove it by supplying Congress with a transcript. But a leading U.S. Republican politician said he would have little faith in any notes Putin might supply. Two U.S. officials said on Monday Trump had disclosed classified information about a planned Islamic State operation to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov when they met last week, plunging the White House into a fresh controversy just four months into Trump’s tenure. Trump, whose administration has been dogged by allegations that Russia helped him win the White House and that he and his allies are too cozy with Moscow, has defended his decision to discuss intelligence with the Russians after media reports of the meeting alarmed some U.S. and foreign politicians. President Putin deployed his trademark sarcasm on Wednesday to make clear he thought the accusation that Trump had divulged secrets absurd.  “I spoke to him (Lavrov) today,” a smiling Putin told a news conference with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi. “I’ll be forced to issue him (Lavrov) with a reprimand because he did not share these secrets with us. Not with me, nor with representatives of Russia’s intelligence services. It was very bad of him.”  Putin, who still hopes Moscow can repair battered ties with the United States despite a deepening political scandal in the United States related to Trump’s purported Russia ties, said Moscow had rated Lavrov’s meeting with Trump highly. If the Trump administration deemed it appropriate, Putin said Russia could hand over a transcript of Trump’s meeting with Lavrov to U.S. lawmakers to reassure them that no secrets were revealed. A Kremlin aide, Yuri Ushakov, later told reporters that Moscow had a written record of the conversation, not an audio recording. U.S. Republican Senator Marco Rubio was unimpressed with Putin’s offer and alluded to alleged Russian hacking of Democratic groups during the U.S. presidential election.  “I wouldn’t put much credibility into whatever Putin’s notes are,” Rubio said on Fox News. “And if it comes in an email, I wouldn’t click on the attachment.” Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which is among those probing alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, called Putin’s offer “quite amusing.” “The last person Trump needs to vouch for him right now is Vladimir Putin,” Schiff said in an interview with CBS News. “If they want to send something, you know, hats off. Send it our way... It’s credibility would be less than zero.” Russia has repeatedly denied interfering in the U.S. election. Trump is also under pressure over accusations he asked then-FBI Director James Comey to end the agency’s investigation into the Russia ties of former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn. The allegation stems from a memo written by Comey and seen by a source familiar with the contents of the memo. In Washington, Republican and Democratic lawmakers said they wanted to see the Comey memo. U.S. Representative Adam Kinzinger joined a small but growing number of Republican lawmakers who have said they would back some sort of independent investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 election. “If in fact what was in the memo is true, it’s very concerning and we need to get to the bottom of that,” Kinzinger said on CNN. Complaining about what he said was “political schizophrenia” in the United States, Putin said Trump was not being allowed to do his job properly. “It’s hard to imagine what else these people who generate such nonsense and rubbish can dream up next,” said Putin, referring to unnamed U.S. politicians.  “What surprises me is that they are shaking up the domestic political situation using anti-Russian slogans. Either they don’t understand the damage they’re doing to their own country, in which case they are simply stupid, or they understand everything, in which case they are dangerous and corrupt.”     Russia has repeatedly said that Trump’s opponents are trying to damage him and Moscow by making what it says are false accusations about the billionaire president and the Russian government which initially had high hopes of a rapprochement. Officials have told Reuters Trump’s alleged disclosure of classified information to Russia’s foreign minister is unlikely to stop allies who share intelligence with Washington from cooperating. That view was reinforced on Wednesday when British Prime Minister Theresa May said her government had confidence in its relationship with the United States and would continue to share intelligence with Britain’s most important defense and security ally.

HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER Makes “Shooting At Trump” Option For Answer On Multiple Choice Test,"EAG News  A Wyoming high school is under fire after parents exposed an online student quiz that offered  shooting at Trump  as one of the multiple choice answers.An unidentified English teacher at Jackson Hole High School gave students a multiple choice quiz on Thursday about George Orwell s novel  Animal Farm  that included a question that many are pointing to as an example of the district s  liberal bias,  the Jackson Hole News and Guide reports. Napoleon has a gun fired for a new occasion. What is the new occasion?  the quiz read.Possible answers included  He was shooting at Trump,   His birthday,   For completion of the windmill,  or  To scare off the attackers of Animal Farm. Jim McCollum told the news site he did a double-take when his son showed him a screenshot he took of the test. I had to read it two times,  McCollum said.  I was like,  Are you kidding me? McCollum, a Jackson Hole High School graduate and Trump supporter, shared the quiz on Facebook, where it was shared widely and generated a lot of angry comments. It was so inappropriate to show a name of a sitting president in that question,  he said.  To me, that is so wrong in light of the situation in our country and the divisiveness and all. He told the news site the incident is one of other examples of  liberal bias  in other classes at the school that make conservative students like son out to be  the outcast. He told me,  Dad, they crapped on everything I believe in,  McCollum said of his son.  Rylee is very patriotic, very supportive of our military and of our country  and is considering enlisting in the U.S. Marines.School officials eventually issued a statement about the quiz on Monday. (District) administration learned late yesterday that a quiz was administered to a class of high school students that contained an inappropriate answer to a multiple choice question. Administration is investigating this incident and verifying the information we have received,  the statement read. (The District) takes seriously threats of any kind, regardless of the intent. We apologize to the students, families, and community for this incident and will be addressing the issue with personnel. It s unclear what, if any, discipline the teacher may face.The incident occurred in the Teton County School District #1.According to The Washington Post:Last year, deeply conservative Wyoming voted for Trump by the widest majority of any state, 70 percent. In Teton County, Hillary Clinton got 60 percent, the only Wyoming county the Democrat won.Teton County is a wealthy ski and summer recreation destination. Residents include former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, Republican U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney.In 2015, school administrators canceled an  America Day  tradition for homecoming in which students donned red, white and blue and rode around on a diesel truck to show their patriotism and love of country. Activities director Mike Hansen put the kibosh on the event because he alleged some students might get offended.The school s juniors and seniors didn t buy it, however, and many showed up to school decked out in stars and stripes, then paraded the diesel truck around the school parking lot at the end of the day, waving American flags. It s homecoming week and our school administration thought it was too  offensive  to have an America Pride Day! So this is my kids answer to that!  local parent Ted Dawson posted to Facebook with pictures of his kids in patriotic get-ups.  Where have we gone wrong! I don t care what race or religion you are, you live here, benefit from the schools, enjoy tax benefits or whatever   you re an American or at least you better be! ",politics,18-Feb-18,1
PAUL JOSEPH WATSON Is Not Happy About The Air Strike On Syria…Here’s Why [VIDEO],"The truth about the air strike on Syria.SHARE: https://t.co/ABMiasgK6D pic.twitter.com/eoEjPeb5w7  Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) April 8, 2017Watson argues that half of Trumps advisors are CFR globalists and that he has NOT yet drained the swamp.Watson also claims the airbase that was bombed was actually protected a nearby Christian town from being overrun by jihadists. He claims that that town will now be taken over by jihadists, and that the air strike on the air base only cleared the way from them to move in and take over.Watson also questions why Assad would have used chemicals to attack his own people when it would be completely self-defeating?  Less than one week ago, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said a regime change in Syria was  off the table . Now Tillerson is saying regime change is back on the table. Why would Assad put himself in this position he asks? Watson believes there is a real chance that Trump has been surrounded and manipulated by neocons in the  deep state .",politics,"Apr 8, 2017",1
Eyewash: CIA Elites Misleading Employees Indicates That Conspiracies Are NOT ‘Ridiculous Fantasy’,"21st Century Wire says The CIA is trying its best to avoid oversight and accountability.Watch a video of this report here: An anonymous ex-CIA officer explains: The classic use of an eyewash is if you have a garden-variety source and all of a sudden he gains access to truly sensitive information, What you might do is have a false communication saying the guy got hit by a bus and died. The large number of people aware of this source suddenly think he is dead. But the continuing reporting on that source and from that source gets put into a very closed compartment that few would know about. In one documented example, CIA officials said that a senior Al-Qaeda member was killed as a result of tribal violence. Yet, in actual fact, the terrorist had been killed by a drone strike.The intent behind this eyewash was to conceal the then-secret CIA drone program in Pakistan.Former CIA inspector general, Fred Hitz, said that deliberately misleading employees is really playing with fire. Steven Aftergood, a government secrecy expert at the Federation of American Scientists, said, When you introduce falsehoods into the communications stream then you can destabilize the whole system of intelligence oversight and compliance with the law. What now needs to be examined is the extent to which this practice still takes places today and who exactly receives the accurate information. Is the true information ever sent to elected officials, or always withheld by this shadow government operating essentially on its own?Interestingly, it is often said by skeptics that any part of the government could never be involved in a monumental conspiracy because too many people would have to know about it, and someone would talk.The exposure of the eyewashing program now crushes this argument, as it reveals to us the extreme extent of compartmentalisation that exists within the modern American government that is capable of hiding the most despicable activities.It is also likely that many other government agencies employ similar tactics, in order to ensure that those at the top stay there and threats to their power can be dealt with quietly. Departments look out for themselves, and particularly their own relevance.Naturally, this intelligence phenomenon extends into the media, as mainstream media outlets always rely on their internal agency  sources  for any  inside information    which could  misleading, or completely false.What might they do, and subsequently try to hide, to ensure they stay relevant?READ MORE ON THE CLANDESTINE CIA: 21st Century Wire CIA Files",US_News,"February 3, 2016",1
Spanish judge orders custody for Catalan leaders pending trial,"MADRID (Reuters) - A Spanish judge ordered nine Catalan secessionist leaders to be held in custody on Thursday pending a potential trial over the region s independence push. The lawyer for ousted Catalan President Carles Puigdemont said a warrant had also been issued for his client s arrest - though the statement was dismissed by a senior official in Spain s High Court. The reason for the differing accounts was not immediately clear. In an short address broadcast by Catalan regional television TV3, Puigdemont called for the release of  the legitimate government of Catalonia , a call echoed by hundreds of people gathered outside the Catalan parliament. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy sacked Puigdemont and his government last week, hours after the Catalan parliament made a unilateral declaration of independence - a vote boycotted by the opposition and declared illegal by Spanish courts. Puigdemont later traveled to Belgium with four associates and ignored an order to appear before the High Court to answer charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds relating to the region s secessionist drive.  Mr. Puigdemont will stay here. He has said that he will fully cooperate with Belgian authorities during the procedure,  lawyer Paul Bekaert told Belgian state broadcaster VRT.  He said Puigdemont had told him a European arrest warrant has been issued, though the court source said that would most likely happen on Friday. The detention of the secessionist leaders and Puigdemont s flight to Belgium make it difficult for leading figures from the independence movement to stand in a snap election in the wealthy region called by the Spanish government for Dec. 21. Puigdemont said on Tuesday he would go back to Spain only if given unspecified guarantees by the Spanish government. His flight appears to have cost some support for his cause at home.  President, enough is enough,  the influential Catalan newspaper el Peridico, which has been skeptical of the case for independence, said on its front page on Wednesday. Ebelio Ramos, a pensioner from the pro-independence town of Berga said:  I don t know what they re thinking about but when someone does what he did and declares independence and then flees... A president has to fulfill the law and if he doesn t, it is better that he stays calm, because if he starts doing something outside the law, he is going to lose everything.  Following a tumultuous month, attention is gradually turning to the December vote. Protests taking place in central Barcelona on Thursday to support secessionist leaders as they testified in Madrid failed to attract a big crowd. Several hundred people took part in another protest called after the nine leaders were ordered held in custody, many fewer than the hundreds of thousands who staged several demonstrations for independence over the last two months.  Cracks have appeared within the pro-independence coalition of center-right and far-left parties as well as inside Puigdemont s own PdeCat (Democratic Catalan Party) where some of his allies are now pushing for a negotiated solution with the central government. The struggle has divided Catalonia itself and caused deep resentment across the rest of Spain. In Madrid, 20 secessionist leaders had been summoned by two separate courts to testify over their role in holding a banned Oct. 1 referendum on secession and later proclaiming independence from Spain. With Puigdemont and four others in Belgium, only 15 turned up. All the members of the dismissed Catalan cabinet but one declined to answer questions from the state prosecutor and the High Court judge, who opened an investigation that could take several years before any potential trial.  The defendants have played an active role by propelling the carefully designed secessionist process and overcoming all kinds of obstacles that could make them deviate from their final objective,  the judge said in the ruling that sent the defendants to jail. She said the defendants, who could face jail sentences of up to 50 years, must be held in custody because they were a flight risk and could destroy evidence. One of them, Santi Vila, who stepped down from the Catalan cabinet before a unilateral declaration of independence last Friday and has since then been pushing for a negotiated solution with the government, was granted bail of 50,000 euros ($58,300). A lawyer for several of the jailed Catalan leaders said they would appeal against the judge s decision.  The decision to hold them in custody is absolutely disproportionate as we consider the charges of rebellion and sedition lack any ground, no matter how much the prosecution insists on affirming it,  lawyer Jaume Alonso-Cuevillas said. Five senior regional lawmakers and the speaker of the Catalan parliament, Carme Forcadell, were summoned by the Supreme Court, which handles the cases of people who enjoy parliamentary immunity. The Supreme Court agreed on Thursday to give one more week to Forcadell and the Catalan lawmakers to prepare their defense and a new hearing will take place on Nov. 9. The courts have already told the Catalan secessionist leaders to deposit 6.2 million euros ($7.2 million) by Friday to cover potential liabilities. ",worldnews,"November 2, 2017 ",0
Republican senator wants Democrats to testify on Trump dossier,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a Republican member of the Intelligence Committee, said Democrats should be called again to testify about reports that their party and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign paid for parts of a dossier that detailed accusations about President Donald Trump’s ties to Russia.  The Washington Post reported last week that Marc Elias, a lawyer for 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Clinton, used campaign funds to hire Fusion GPS, the firm behind the dossier. Committees in both chambers of Congress have been investigating the origin and contents of the document. John Podesta, who was Clinton’s campaign chairman, and U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was the head of the Democratic National Committee at the time, as well as Elias “absolutely need to be recalled” to testify,” Collins said in an appearance on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”  “It’s difficult to imagine that a campaign chairman, that the head of the DNC would not know of an expenditure of this magnitude and significance,” Collins said. “But perhaps there’s something more going on here. But certainly, it’s worth additional questioning of those two witnesses. And the lawyer; absolutely, he more than anyone.”  It has been widely reported that supporters of Republican Jeb Bush, a primary opponent of Trump, initially paid for the firm’s research. Perkins Coie, Elias’ law firm, confirmed on Tuesday that it had hired Fusion GPS in April 2016. The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative online publication backed by billionaire Republican megadonor Paul Singer, said on Friday it was the original funder of the Fusion GPS project to compile opposition research on multiple Republican presidential candidates, including Trump. Known as the Steele dossier because it was compiled by former MI6 officer Christopher Steele, the document identified Russian businessmen and others who U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded are Russian intelligence officers or working on behalf of the Russian government. Representative Trey Gowdy, a Republican who runs the House Oversight Committee, said in an appearance on “Fox News Sunday” that he was more interested in whether the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Department of Justice used the dossier in conducting their own probes.  “I don’t expect the (Democratic National Committee) to be objective,” Gowdy said. “Almost by definition, opposition research is not objective.  “The next thing that House Intel is trying to find out is whether or not the U.S. government relied on it.” ",politicsNews,"October 29, 2017 ",0
Denmark set to become next European country to ban burqas,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark looks set to become the next European country to restrict the burqa and the niqab, worn by some Muslim women, after most parties in the Danish parliament backed some sort of ban on facial coverings. Full and partial face veils such as burqas and niqabs divide opinion across Europe, setting advocates of religious freedom against secularists and those who argue that such garments are culturally alien or a symbol of the oppression of women. The niqab covers everything but the eyes, while the burqa also covers the eyes with a transparent veil. France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Bulgaria and the German state of Bavaria have all imposed some restrictions on the wearing of full-face veils in public places.  This is not a ban on religious clothing, this is a ban on masking,  Jacob Ellemann-Jensen, spokesman for the Liberal Party, told reporters on Friday after his party, the largest in the coalition government, decided to back a ban. This would effectively mean a ban on the niqab and the burqa, he added. Around 200 women in Denmark wear such garments, according to researchers. The three-party center-right minority government, its ally the Danish People s Party and the main opposition Social Democrats have all said they are in favor of a ban, though they are still discussing how the ban should be designed and enforced.  There will come a masking ban in Denmark. That s how it is,  Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen said on Facebook. His party, the Liberal Alliance, had previously been one of the staunchest opponents of a ban, saying it limited people s ability to freely choose their attire, but has now aligned its stance with that of the other coalition parties, the Conservatives and the Liberals.  So if it is practically possible to have such a ban without betraying ourselves or our own values, then the Liberal Alliance will vote for it,  Samuelsen said. The Social Democrats, Denmark s biggest party, has also signaled support in principle for a ban on garments such as the burqa, which it said oppressed women.  We are ready to ban the burqa if that is what it takes ... But there are some dilemmas, not least with regards to how such a ban would be enforced,  said the Social Democrats  leader Mette Fredriksen during a debate in parliament on Thursday. Norway s government in June proposed a ban on face-covering Muslim veils in kindergartens, schools and universities.             ",worldnews,"October 6, 2017 ",0
 Colbert Lays A Catholic Smack Down On Trump Over Pope Francis Fight (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has added Pope Francis to his very long list of people he is feuding with. During an episode of The Late Show with Colbert, Stephen Colbert did a hilarious bit about Trump s latest failure attempt to pander to Christians.The feud came after Pope Francis was quoted as saying that Trump is not a Christian, A person who thinks only about building walls wherever they may be and not of building bridges is not a Christian,  Pope Francis said while traveling to Rome from Mexico. When asked if he thought people should or should not vote for Trump, Pope Francis responded saying,  As far as what you said about whether I would advise to vote or not to vote, I am not going to get involved in that. I say only that this man is not Christian if he has said things like that. Trump released an official campaign response, where said that Pope Francis is going to regret not supporting him and his campaign when ISIS attacks the Vatican. During a campaign rally on Thursday Trump had this to say: As I m walking up here, they said,  Mr. Trump, the pope made a statement about you,  and I said,  The pope? What did the pope say? I like the pope   was it good or bad? Because if it was good, I like the pope. If it s bad, I don t like the pope. Colbert mocks Trump during the segment, saying: It s like Jesus said:  Blessed are the poor, unless they said something bad about me   then screw them. Trump is trying to pander to Christians. He really needs them in order to secure his chances at receiving the Republican primary nomination.As I have pointed out before, Trump is making himself look a fool doing it too. It s not just that Trump isn t saying the wrong things to win over Christian voters. He doesn t even appear to understand the basic concepts of Christianity. This was shown Trump publicly stated that he had not asked Jesus Christ for forgiveness.You can the video below.Featured image from video screenshot",News,"February 19, 2016",1

UK's Corbyn wants much more information on EU divorce deal,"GENEVA (Reuters) - British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Friday he wanted to see much more information about the Brexit divorce deal struck between Prime Minister Theresa May s government and the European Commission. May sealed the deal after a pre-dawn dash to Brussels, thereby clearing the way for the start of arduous talks on future trade ties between Britain and the EU after Brexit. Asked if he thought the deal with the EU was a breakthrough, Corbyn told reporters:  Until I see more of it, no.   Speaking in Geneva after a visit to the United Nations, Corbyn said his party stood ready for another parliamentary election in Britain at any time, noting May s reliance for her majority on Northern Ireland s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).  They (the DUP) seem to be calling the shots all the time. They scuppered a deal she was trying to make a few days ago and they clearly put conditions on this, which is why I want to see a much fuller statement than we ve had thus far,  he said. The next election in Britain is not due until 2022, but there has been much media speculation that it could come much earlier due to May s lack of a parliamentary majority and deep divisions within her governing Conservative Party over Brexit. Corbyn said Labour had consistently called for maintaining the benefits of belonging to the EU s customs union and single market during a transitional period as Britain leaves the bloc.  The transitional period is unspecific and I think she needs to bring some clarity to that,  he said. The transition should be long enough to guarantee UK and EU jobs and to deal with common problems, such as regulating airspace, he said. It should also ensure that consumers , workers  and environmental rights were put into British law.   The statements that have been made this morning do not specify what regulatory framework there will be in the future and that remains to be seen, because there are still many people in the Conservative Party who want to live in a de-regulated environment, where Britain basically lowers wages and conditions and the tax take on large corporations.      Corbyn said he hoped Friday s deal included sections on the rights of family reunion for EU and British citizens, adding they should be granted unilaterally and not negotiated. A reference in the deal to involving the European Court of Justice on citizenship issues for up to eight years was a sign that the government accepted the need for judicial oversight of citizens  rights, he said.

 Watch Joy Behar And Trump Supporting Audience Member Go Head To Head (VIDEO),"While many in the United States have come to the logical decision that Donald Trump is stark raving mad, there are still those who apparently have made him their choice for president. One of those people was just in the audience for a taping of ABC s The View and was questioned by host Joy Behar after the show.When the woman who supports Trump (yes, woman) is asked why, she refuses to say why   which if I may add is very Trumpian, because Trump always makes claims with nothing to back it up either   he then explains that she voted for President Obama, but said that it was the biggest mistake of her life. Then she said she works in a hospital and hates Obamacare, even though moments later she said she s been unemployed for a year. She somehow thinks that Trump would actually be better for healthcare and the unemployed. When asked if maybe she should support Bernie Sanders, who wants to provided single payer and a better safety net, she adamantly refused.Now, not to speak ill of a woman who clearly doesn t understand how the parties operate and who stands for what, but it seems she wants to go back to a system that will harm her more than help her. And I think a lot of the blame for her misunderstanding comes down to misinformation and even lack of information being spread by not only candidates, but the media.This woman wants change. Sure. That s great. However, what she wants she s not going to find in Trump.Watch the back and forth here: Watch what happens when @JoyVBehar questions an audience member s support for Donald Trump: https://t.co/kQ9dGmHJ1O  The View (@TheView) May 12, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 12, 2016",1
Globalization’s Inside Man: The Problem with David Petraeus in Trump’s Cabinet,"21st Century Wire says If you re going to  drain the swamp  then the last thing you want to do is set a 500 lb crocodile loose into the marshes. Throughout his campaign, President-Elect Donald J. Trump was adamant about getting rid of the redundant North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). So why then is he courting globalist acolyte David Petraeus?Back in 2014, The New American reported: Former general and CIA chief David Petraeus (shown), a key figure in the globalist Council on Foreign Relations and the shadowy Bilderberg network, boasted at a recent conference that the United States of America is set to be merged into the continental regime being erected under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Speaking at the Margaret Thatcher Conference on Liberty last week in London, the ex-commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan and Iraq essentially celebrated the end of U.S. independence   and by extension, the demise of the Constitution.   After America comes North America,  Petraeus said confidently in answering the question about what comes after the United States, the theme of the panel discussion.  Are we on the threshold of the North American decade, question mark? I threw that away   threw away the question mark   and boldly proclaimed the coming North American decade, says the title now.  He also boasted about how the three economies have been put  together  over the last 20 years as part of the  implementation  of the North American Free Trade Act Undoubtedly, Petraeus is not only a devotee of NAFTA (and the TPP and TTIP), but he is a career committed globalist.What s worse however, is that after his disgraceful exit from Washington, David Petraeus has become a regular attendee at the transatlantic elite globalist confab known as the Bilderberg Meeting   a meeting where North American and European corporate elites, billionaires and corrupted politicians meet in secret behind closed-door to decide the coming year s political and economic  agenda    completely outside of any democratic accountability.So from a globalization perspective, Petraeus has already sold US national sovereignty down the river, and into the swamp. In terms of anything Trump was campaigning on, Petraeus would be globalist embed in his cabinet.From a military perspective, when you throw away the hype, you might find that David Petraeus is one of the most over-rated figures in US military history. After the unmitigated disaster that was Iraq War, Petraeus was awarded the lofty title of ,  The Architect of The Surge,  referring to the 2007 troop surge in Iraq, which itself was a complete media creation after-the-fact, designed to rehabilitate President Bush s abject failure, but also to re-inflate Petraeus s public image in the wake of his own mishandling of classified intelligence into the hands of Deep State operative Paula Broadwell   the woman he was having an extramarital affair with. Petraeus was not only incompetent as a military man (see article below), he had passed state secrets to his mistress while he was head of the CIA before resigning in 2012.Normally, a disastrous record such as this would disqualify any person from ever serving in public office again   but Petraeus is special   he s one of the globalists  most trusted inside men. That s why his path is constantly being paved ahead of him.Many Trump voters rejected Hillary Clinton for her own horrendous private email server debacle   so why would they accept a highly compromised (and convicted) man in Petraeus. If Trump is considering Petraeus for any role in his government   this would be the absolute height of hypocrisy, and should be called out as such.Everyone should read the article below written by veteran CIA Analyst Ray McGovern. Listen to McGovern s recent interview on Patrick Henningsen LIVE last week on Independent Talk 1100 KFNX Consortium News Exclusive: President-elect Trump s promise to  drain the swamp  of Washington seems forgotten   like so many political promises   as he meets with swamp creatures, such as disgraced Gen. David Petraeus, says ex-CIA analyst Ray McGovern .By Ray McGovern  The news that President-elect Donald Trump called in disgraced retired Gen. David Petraeus for a job interview as possible Secretary of State tests whether Trump s experience in hosting  The Celebrity Apprentice  honed his skills for spotting an incompetent phony or not.Does Trump need more data than the continuing bedlam in Iraq and Afghanistan to understand that one can earn a Princeton PhD by writing erudite-sounding drivel about  counterinsurgency  and still flunk war? Granted, the shambles in which Petraeus left Iraq and Afghanistan were probably more a result of his overweening careerism and political ambition than his misapplication of military strategy. But does that make it any more excusable?In 2007, Adm. William Fallon, commander of CENTCOM with four decades of active-duty experience behind him, quickly took the measure of Petraeus, who was one of his subordinates while implementing a  surge  of over 30,000 U.S. troops into Iraq.Several sources reported that Fallon was sickened by Petraeus s unctuous pandering to ingratiate himself. Fallon is said to have been so turned off by all the accolades in the flowery introduction given him by Petraeus that he called him to his face  an ass-kissing little chickenshit,  adding,  I hate people like that. Sadly, Petraeus s sycophancy is not uncommon among general officers. Uncommon was Fallon s outspoken candor.The past decade has shown that obsequiousness to those above him and callousness toward others are two of Petraeus s most notable character traits. They go along with his lack of military acumen and his dishonesty as revealed in his lying to the FBI about handing over top-secret notebooks to his biographer/lover, an  indiscretion  that would have landed a less well-connected person in jail but instead got him only a mild slap on the wrist (via a misdemeanor guilty plea).Indeed, Petraeus, the epitome of a  political general,  represents some of the slimiest depths of the Washington  swamp  that President-elect Trump has vowed to drain. Petraeus cares desperately about the feelings of his fellow elites but shows shocking disdain for the suffering of other human beings who are not so important.In early 2011 in Afghanistan, Petraeus shocked aides to then-President Hamid Karzai after many children were burned to death in a  coalition  attack in northeastern Afghanistan by suggesting that Afghan parents may have burned their own children to exaggerate their claims of civilian casualties and discredit the U.S., reported The Washington Post, citing two participants at the meeting. Killing 60 people, and then blaming the killing on those same people, rather than apologizing for any deaths? This is inhuman,  one Afghan official said.  This is a really terrible situation. Yet, on other occasions, the politically savvy Petraeus can be a paragon of sensitivity   like when he is in danger of getting crosswise with the Israel Lobby.Never did Petraeus s fawning shine through with more brilliance, than when an (unintentionally disclosed) email exchange showed him groveling before arch-neocon Max Boot, beseeching Boot s help in fending off charges that Petraeus was  anti-Israel  because his prepared testimony to a congressional committee included the no-brainer observations that Israeli-Palestinian hostility presents  distinct challenges to our ability to advance our interests  and that  this conflict foments anti-American sentiment, due to a perception of U.S. favoritism for Israel.   Meanwhile, al-Qaeda and other militant groups exploit that anger to mobilize support. So, telling the truth (perhaps accidentally in prepared testimony) made Petraeus squirm with fear about offending the powerful Israel Lobby, but he apparently didn t hesitate to lie to FBI agents when he was caught in a tight spot for sharing highly sensitive intelligence with Paula Broadwell, his mistress/biographer. But, again, Petraeus realized that it helps to have influential friends. A court gave him a slap on the wrist with a sentence of two years probation and a fine of $100,000   which is less than he usually makes for a single speaking engagement Continue this article at Consortium NewsREAD MORE BILDERBERG NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Bilderberg Files",Middle-east,"December 5, 2016",1

Couple defy Hurricane Maria on roof to save pets - lots of them,"YAUCO, Puerto Rico (Reuters) - Hurricane Maria battered this quiet Puerto Rican outpost and covered it with mud, but it couldn t separate Sandra Harasimowicz from her beloved pets. She and her husband Gary Rosario said they clung to the side of a house for hours last week to save their seven dogs from a hurricane that reduced their picturesque neighborhood in Puerto Rico to a desolate mud pit. Harasimowicz, 43, a native of Poland said the couple were trapped neck-deep in water after Hurricane Maria tore into their home in the southwestern town of Yauco last Wednesday, sending them and their dogs scrambling onto a neighbor s roof to escape. The storm, which has killed at least 10 people across the U.S. territory, turned the couple s street into bed of debris-strewn silt after a nearby river burst its banks. The surging flow entered their house  like it was the end of the world,  Harasimowicz told Reuters on Monday. Trying to keep the animals close in the hurricane while holding tight to solar panels on the neighbor s roof, Harasimowicz said she watched aghast as one of the dogs jumped four times into the raging torrent that had swamped the street. Each time Rosario, who is Puerto Rican and a national guardsman, leapt in after the errant dog to haul it back to safety.  I thought I was going to lose him; he just did it because he s such an animal lover,  said Harasimowicz, whose family lives in the city of Poznan in western Poland.  I said:  That s it, I m losing the animals and I m losing my husband.  The mother of two explained how the couple had earlier stashed their eight cats on top of the kitchen cupboards to ride out the storm when the floodwaters started rising to their chins. The couple had already sent their children, aged 6 and 12, to stay with a friend nearby before Maria struck. But after failing to find a refuge for the cats and dogs, Harasimowicz said they felt they should remain there with the animals, in part because they did not believe the storm would be so severe.  Basically, we underestimated,  Harasimowicz said. Maria knocked out power and telecommunications across the island of 3.4 million, unleashing chaos and disorder that residents believe will take months from which to recover. Residents of the Yauco estate known as Urbanizacion Luchetti returned to find furniture, refrigerators and washing machines had moved around their homes in the mud bath. Floors were caked in a musty-smelling brown sludge. Furnishings were ruined.  Everyone says they want to leave here,  said neighbor Jose Velazquez, 57, reviewing the mess Maria had made of his home. At the end of the street, the rotting body of a pit bull lay on its side by a house railing, maggots teeming at its neck. Harasimowicz and Rosario returned home Wednesday night when the flooding began to recede, spending the night on top of a bunk bed with their pets. But they were horrified as the waters began rising again. Believing they had no choice in order to survive, the couple broke into a neighbor s house with a hammer so they could occupy its rooftop annex with their pets. By then, they had acquired another dog that had wandered up seeking shelter from the storm.  It was either break in or die,  said Rosario, a jovial 49-year-old who on Monday was taking stock of his ruined home and the family s gaggle of pets, all of which survived. The couple have bathed and washed their clothes in rainwater collecting on the roof, and are now planning their next move. After 12 years in Puerto Rico - seven of them in Yauco - Harasimowicz said she has had enough.  Never again,  she said.  This is over for me.  ",worldnews,"September 26, 2017 ",0
Italy's Berlusconi probed over deadly 1993 mafia bombings: source,"FLORENCE, Italy (Reuters) - Former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi is under investigation as part of an investigation into mafia bombings in 1993, a judicial source said on Tuesday, confirming newspaper reports. A mob boss jailed for the deadly attacks in Rome, Milan and Florence was recorded talking to his cellmate about the four-times premier, prompting a judge in Florence to reopen a shelved probe into Berlusconi s alleged involvement, the Italian newspapers Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica reported.  Berlusconi s lawyer Nicolo Ghedini said a previous investigation had shown his client was not involved in the bombings, which killed 10 people. Ghedini said the case had re-emerged for political reasons ahead of an important regional ballot in Sicily on Sunday and a national election due by next May.  Even speculating that (Berlusconi) could have been in any way involved in the events in question is so absurd as to make any comment unnecessary,  Ghedini said in a statement.  (It is) obvious that the umpteenth investigation can only end in a swift dismissal, as happened in the past.  A previous probe into the 81-year-old media mogul s alleged involvement in the case was shelved in 2011. Berlusconi was due to visit Sicily later on Tuesday to campaign for his Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party ahead of Sunday s regional election. Judges investigating the mafia case, which is raking over arguably the murkiest years in modern Italian history, heard fragmented recordings of conversations mob leader Giuseppe Graviano had last April in jail, the newspapers reported.   1992 he already wanted to get involved (in politics) ... and he wanted everything,  Graviano was reportedly recorded saying, referring to  Berlusca  - a common nickname for Berlusconi.   Berlusca ... asked me this favor ... I was convinced Berlusconi would win the election ... in Sicily ... he wanted to get involved ... but at that time the old guys were around ... he told me we needed a really good thing.  The mafia bombing campaign on mainland Italy stunned the country and helped lead to the collapse of the old political parties, which were riddled with corruption. Berlusconi entered politics in early 1994 and immediately won a national election. Forza Italia said in a statement that 1,296 mafiosi had been arrested during Berlusconi s years in office between 2001-05 and 2008-2011, including 32 of Italy s most wanted mobsters.  It said Berlusconi s administration had toughened prison conditions for mobsters and had seized 25 billion euros ($29.09 billion) of mafia property in its last three years in office.

Trump tax reforms could depend on little-known 'scoring' panel,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump’s goal of overhauling the U.S. tax code in 2017 will depend partly on the work of an obscure congressional committee tasked with estimating how much future economic growth will result from tax cuts. Known as the Joint Committee on Taxation, or JCT, the nonpartisan panel assigns “dynamic scores” to major tax bills in Congress, based on economic models, to forecast a bill’s ultimate impact on the federal budget. The higher a tax bill’s dynamic score, the more likely it is seen as spurring growth, raising tax revenues and keeping the federal deficit in check. As Trump and Republicans in Congress plan the biggest tax reform package in a generation, the JCT has come under pressure from corporate lobbyists and other tax cut advocates who worry that too low a dynamic score could show the legislation to add billions, if not trillions of dollars to the federal deficit.    “The problem is that the Joint Committee staff has adopted a whole series of assumptions that truly minimize the effects and underestimate the impact that a properly done tax reform could have,” said David Burton, an economic policy fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank. A low dynamic score could force Republicans to scale back tax cuts or make the reforms temporary, severely limiting the scope of what was one of Trump’s top campaign pledges. Other analysts warn that pressure for a robust dynamic score raises the danger of a politically expedient number that could help reform pass Congress but lead to higher deficits down the road.    Until last year, JCT used a variety of economic models in its arcane calculations, reflecting the uncertainties in such work. But House of Representatives Republicans changed the rules in 2015 to require that a bill’s score reflect only a single estimate of the estimated impact on the wider economy and resulting impact on tax revenues. Next year’s anticipated tax reform package would be the biggest piece of legislation that JCT has scored using this new, narrower approach, presenting the committee with a daunting challenge. JCT Chief of Staff Thomas Barthold acknowledged the challenge of dynamic scoring in an interview with Reuters. “The U.S. economy is so darn complex, you really can’t have one model that picks up all of the complexity and nuance. So the essence of modeling is to try to slim things down, try to emphasize certain points,” he said. Tax reform is still months away. But the initial legislation expected in 2017 is likely to fall somewhere between two similar but separate plans, one backed by Trump and the other by House Republicans including Speaker Paul Ryan.    The proposals lean heavily for fiscal legitimacy on dynamic scoring. Even the most robust independent scores show both plans adding to the deficit. But dynamic scoring, like any economic modeling technique, is far from precise and, when it comes to fiscal policy, any theoretical flaws could lead to very real consequences for taxpayers and the U.S. economy. The JCT has included macroeconomic analyses in its tax bill scores since 2003, providing a range of estimates on economic effects built on a variety of assumptions. When Dave Camp, as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, produced a tax reform bill in 2014, JCT used two models and forecast revenue gains ranging from $50 billion to $700 billion. The committee also provided economic growth forecasts from as low as 0.2 percent to as high as 1.8 percent. The tax package likely to emerge next year will probably be even more complex than Camp’s, prompting some to worry that budgetary and economic forecasts will range even more widely. Some critics, including lobbyists for major corporations that stand to gain from big tax cuts, want JCT’s numbers to look more like the nonpartisan Tax Foundation’s, a research group whose work has been embraced by Trump and House Republicans. The Tax Foundation estimates that the House Republican tax plan would lead to a 9.1 percent higher gross domestic product over the long term, 7.7 percent higher wages and 1.7 million new full-time-equivalent jobs. It predicts the plan would reduce government revenue by $2.4 trillion over a decade, not counting macroeconomic effects, but by only $191 billion once economic growth is taken into account. By contrast, the centrist Tax Policy Center estimates the House plan would add 1 percent to GDP over 10 years and erase $2.5 trillion of revenue, even with positive macroeconomic feedback, due to higher federal debt interest.

"PRO ABORTION PAC, Emily’s List Doing Its Part To Keep Minority Population In Check… Endorses Hillary","Of course Emily s List is going to support Hillary, because Democrats have been doing their part to keep the   unwanted  or  undesirable  babies from making it out of the womb alive for decades .WASHINGTON, D.C.   Today EMILY s List, the nation s largest resource for women in politics, endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. Clinton is on track to become the first woman to win the Democratic nomination, and if elected, the first woman president of the United States. Hillary Clinton is a lifelong champion for women and families and the most qualified candidate to be president,  said Stephanie Schriock, President of EMILY s List.  With roots in the middle class, Hillary s top priority is changing the economic reality for American families. Her focus is on strengthening the middle class, creating jobs, and making sure hardworking families get a fair shot. No one will work harder than Hillary. She knows how to lead so Washington fights for all Americans. As president, Hillary will create more opportunities than ever for women and girls (give them access to on demand abortions) and for all hardworking Americans across the country, just as she has done throughout her exceptional career. The EMILY s List community   now more than three million members strong   is proud to endorse Hillary Clinton for president. Hillary Clinton has devoted her entire career to fighting for women and families (supporting the killing of unborn babies). Instead of going to a big law firm after graduating from Yale Law School, she took her first job going door to door for the Children s Defense Fund. She helped lead the fight for the Children s Health Insurance Program as first lady of the United States, and she put emphasis on women s rights as a  cornerstone of American foreign policy  as Secretary of State.A visionary leader who s always worked to create opportunity for others, Hillary has said she believes  our challenge is to be clear-eyed about the world as it is while never losing sight of the world as we want it to become.  When she is elected president, it will mean more opportunities for women, more opportunities for girls, and more opportunities for hardworking Americans across the country.Via: Weasel Zippers",left-news,"Apr 13, 2015",1
 Former George W. Bush Speechwriter Epically Blasts Republicans For Supporting Trump,"This is a HUGE condemnation of the Republican Party.Ever since Donald Trump kicked off his campaign for the presidency, Republicans have cowered before him endorsing him one by one even after saying that they disagree with him and despise the divisive and hateful rhetoric he spews.But former George W. Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson put his writing skills to use on Thursday to pen an epic rebuke of Donald Trump and the Republicans who support him. Trump pretty much represents the negation of everything I ve argued about politics and ideology for the last 30 years,  Gerson wrote on Facebook.What he is attacking is not just  the establishment.  He is attacking a way of doing politics based on persuasion, consensus, compassion and inclusion. Those who argue that conservatism is fundamentally at odds with these values know nothing of conservatism. But Trump represents the confirmation of the worse conservative and Republican caricatures   a belief that cultural and religious minorities are threats, a belief that America should abandon its deepest values in the conduct of global affairs, a belief that the values and institutions of our government have failed, and that the times require a strong hand.Gerson continued ripping Trump for wanting to tear down what makes America great.At its best (and, God knows, it has not always been at its best) America shows a welcoming spirit, an example of how a great nation can be united by ideals instead of bloodlines, a place, as George Washington said, where  there shall be none to make him afraid.  We should love American traditions and institutions enough to repair them, not hand them over to an authoritarian wannabe, who is too ignorant to even understand the inheritance he is casting away.And then he really let Trump have it.Trump s magical policy thinking, setting goals with no serious thought of how they might be achieved; his menacing encouragement of political violence; his disdain for ethnic and religious minorities, which has unleashed and emboldened racists and anti-Semites of every sort; his penchant for conspiracy theories, including a very dangerous vaccine denialism; his promises to conduct the war on terrorism by ordering war crimes, which would set up a constitutional crisis when the US military honorably refuses; his cynical manipulation of gullible religious leaders with tactics that border on blasphemy; his casual use of lies, which he defends even when exposed.Gerson then turned his focus toward the GOP and slammed them for supporting Trump even though he represents the destruction of all the progress America had made since gaining independence from Great Britain and damned them to regret it for all of time.How does any of this return lost greatness to our nation? Sometimes I want to shake people (intellectually,not physically) who favor political  disruption  and ask: Disruption in favor of what? Look at what you are doing! Look at what you have done! The Republican Party is now firmly harnessed to the wild, uncontrollable horses of fear and exclusion. It has already sustained damage with Latino voters that may take a generation to undo. And now many Republicans will find rationalizations to support Trump. That is natural   the reality of politics in every time. Many people simply go with the winner. But this isn t a normal time. I believe that the decision to support Trump, like an embarrassing tattoo, will follow them the rest of their lives. Republicans are not merely making a choice; they are looking into the abyss.Here s the full post via Facebook.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;I feel bad, on one hand, to be so focused on (some would say, obsessed by) the Trump phenomenon. And it is my intention Posted by Michael J. Gerson on Thursday, March 17, 2016Gerson ended his post by leaving a link to an op-ed he wrote for the Washington Post in which he says Republicans are staining themselves by supporting Trump and that perhaps one of the only honorable option left to save themselves from being forever remembered as the party that destroyed America is to vote for Hillary Clinton.Seriously, Republicans.

"FIRED! #NeverTrumper, Close Friend Of Reince Preibus, White House Deputy-Chief-Of-Staff Katie Walsh OUTED As Leaker","Many people were wondering why the White House was holding back on calling out the congressional intelligence oversight gang-of-eight regarding their political unwillingness to review the same executive intelligence previously reviewed by House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes.Today, you just got the answer.White House Deputy Chief-of-Staff Katie Walsh was fired today immediately following a New York Times report which outed two National Security Council members as the source for Devin Nunes  tip  to review a specific batch of President Obama s executive intelligence. The transparent sequence of events reveals that Walsh was the source of NYT reporter Maggie Haberman s article; (Walsh and Haberman are  friends ).Breitbart   Walsh is a  close ally of chief of staff Reince Priebus,  having served as his chief of staff at the Republican National Committee.Walsh previously told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview ahead of President Trump s exclusive interview with Breitbart News in the Oval Office that she was in charge of the president s schedule, and coordinating the activities of Trump s unusual circuit of senior aides like Priebus, chief strategist and former Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon, and Trump son-in-law and senior adviser to the president Jared Kushner.Walsh said in the exclusive interview with Breitbart News last month:As you know, we ve got a lot of senior folks in the White House who have a great ability to help push the president s agenda and message and that s Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon, Jared Kushner, KellyAnne Conway, and others, but there is a logistical piece of that that has to get implemented and so I try and help with that. So I try and do what I can to make sure the right hand is talking to the left hand and everyone knows what everyone is doing, and there is a cohesive operation or effort to make sure, whatever we re doing, that nothing happens in a silo if you will. So even if Reince is with the president working on something, and Jared is working on an issue related to trade, and Steve is working on an issue related to immigration or something, we try and make sure everyone is still on the same page and working together and moving together as fast as we can.But rumors surfaced online that Walsh was leaking information about the White House. Everyone knows not to talk to her in the White House unless you want to see it in the press,  Got News editor Charles Johnson quoted a  source close to the president  as saying in February.  The only question is whether or not she s doing it at the behest of [White House Chief of Staff] Reince Priebus or if she s doing it to advance herself in DC media circles. And with the White House Leaker now identified and fired, the White House challenges the congressional intelligence committee leaders, four members of the oversight  gang-of-eight,  to come and review the Obama intelligence report. That review request paints Intel Committee Ranking Member Adam Schiff, and Senate Intelligence Committee Vice-Chair Senator Mark Warner into a corner.President Trump is now challenging the House and Senate intel committee heads to review the evidence of President Obama s surveillance. How can they refuse to see the truth without exposing their political agenda?Well played, Team Trump, well played.Here s the play   FIRST THE LEAKER:White House deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, a top aide to President Donald Trump, is leaving his administration to work for an outside group supporting the president s agenda, three Republicans close to Trump said. [ ] Walsh was a close ally of White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, serving as his chief of staff when Priebus led the Republican National Committee. (link)Katie Walsh was brought on specifically because President Trump s Chief-of-Staff Reince Priebus asked for her. Walsh was a #NeverTrumper during the 2016 primary.[Now fathom the renewed leverage/influence President Trump (and Bannon) carries over Priebus.]  The article written by Maggie Haberman outlined two National Security Council members as the people who facilitated the intelligence information for Devin Nunes to review:[ ] The congressman [Nunes] has refused to identify his sources, saying he needed to protect them so others would feel safe coming to the committee with sensitive information. He disclosed the existence of the intelligence reports on March 22, and in his public comments he has described his sources as whistle-blowers trying to expose wrongdoing at great risk to themselves.Several current American officials identified the White House officials as Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the senior director for intelligence at the National Security Council, and Michael Ellis, a lawyer who works on national security issues at the White House Counsel s Office and formerly worked on the staff of the House Intelligence Committee.A White House spokesperson declined to comment.Mr. Cohen-Watnick is a former Defense Intelligence Agency official who was originally brought to the White House by Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser. The officials said that this month, shortly after Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter about being wiretapped on the orders of President Barack Obama, Mr. Cohen-Watnick began reviewing highly classified reports detailing the intercepted communications of foreign officials.Officials said the reports consisted primarily of ambassadors and other foreign officials talking about how they were trying to develop contacts within Mr. Trump s family and inner circle in advance of his inauguration.The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the intelligence and to avoid angering Mr. Cohen-Watnick and Mr. Ellis. Officials say Mr. Cohen-Watnick has been reviewing the reports from his fourth-floor office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where the National Security Council is based.But the officials  description of the intelligence is in line with Mr. Nunes s own characterization of the material, which he has said was not related to the Russia investigations when he disclosed its existence in a hastily arranged news conference.According to Mr. Nunes, he received a phone call from a source the night before, and then rushed to meet the person on the grounds of the White House. He has explained the choice of location by saying he needed access to a secure place where people with security clearances could legally view classified information, though such facilities can also be found in the Capitol building and at other locations across Washington.The next day, Mr. Nunes gave a news briefing at the Capitol and then returned to the White House to brief President Trump on the information. (link)With Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the senior director for intelligence at the National Security Council, and Michael Ellis, a lawyer who works on national security issues at the White House Counsel s Office, outed as the source of the information for Chairman Nunes   the entire media narrative of  controversy  collapses as a nothingburger.Both Ezra Cohen-Watnick and Michael Ellis are cleared and authorized to act on behalf of the President in such matters. The President s National Security Council has a responsibility to follow intelligence protocols to draw attention to matters of compromise; their notification of Intel Chairman Devin Nunes is following that protocol.  So the administration action follows   With the long-sought White House leaker (Katie Walsh) identified and released, and the controversy of the Nunes leaker a nothingburger, the White House now moves forward with a brilliant request to the Intelligence Oversight Gang-of-Eight to come and review the aforementioned discovery of President Obama surveillance.For entire story: Conservative Treehouse",politics,"Mar 31, 2017",1
Planning group puts $43 billion price tag on Illinois transportation fix,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Cash-strapped Illinois needs $43 billion over 10 years to repair and improve its transportation network and boost the state economy, according to a report released on Monday by the Metropolitan Planning Council. “The $43 billion needed to rebuild and improve our transportation infrastructure is less than what we’re wasting today on vehicle repairs due to poor road conditions, time lost to traffic congestion, and population and jobs going to neighboring states,” Jim Reilly, a senior fellow at the nonprofit, nonpartisan Chicago region planning group, said in a statement.  The fifth-largest U.S. state is in its 10th month without a full fiscal 2016 budget due to an impasse between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature. Illinois is struggling with a $6.7 billion bill backlog as pensions and debt payments gobble up a big chunk of available revenue. The report called for raising $2.7 billion a year by increasing the current 19 cents-a-gallon state gasoline tax by 30 cents and hiking vehicle registration fees, which cost $101 a year for most cars, by 50 percent. Half of the new money would be tapped for pay-as-you-go projects, with the other half backing $25 billion of 25-year bonds.  The money would be spent on state and local roads, mass transit and railroads. The council recommended an amendment to the Illinois Constitution creating a transportation trust fund to ensure the new revenue is not diverted for other purposes. ",politicsNews,"April 4, 2016 ",0

 ANOTHER Trump Adviser Under Investigation For Russian Ties,"It s no secret that Russia is very pro-Donald Trump, and Donald Trump is extremely pro-Russia. His policies align with Russia s Christmas list, and he hired   for a campaign manager   a man who benefited heavily from pro-Russian monies during the Ukrainian conflict. In fact, the ties between Paul Manafort and Russian oligarchs became so widely known that it caused his premature departure from the campaign, prompting many questions to be raised.The Trump campaign thought this would all be behind them in no time.But, as usual, they were wrong.On Friday, it was a announced that U.S. intelligence officials are investigating Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser to Trump, for alleged ties to Russia. Intelligence officials have reason to believe that Page has opened up secret and backroom communications with top Russian officials in an ongoing effort to have economic sanctions lifted.According to Yahoo News, which first broke the story:The activities of Trump adviser Carter Page, who has extensive business interests in Russia, have been discussed with senior members of Congress during recent briefings about suspected efforts by Moscow to influence the presidential election, the sources said. After one of those briefings, Senate minority leader Harry Reid wrote FBI Director James Comey, citing reports of meetings between a Trump adviser (a reference to Page) and  high ranking sanctioned individuals  in Moscow over the summer as evidence of  significant and disturbing ties  between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin that needed to be investigated by the bureau.The reports apparently had some members of Congress  taken aback,  due to the overwhelming and disturbing evidence that shows these ties. Congressional members, which includes California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, fear that such ties could lead to an unfair tampering with not only U.S.-Russian relations, but undercut foreign policy and even the November presidential election.Page is a former banker who worked for Merrill Lynch and is based in Moscow, giving him strong ties with rich and influential Russian officials. In fact, one of Page s business buddies is especially problematic for American diplomacy and international law:But U.S. officials have since received intelligence reports that during that same three-day trip, Page met with Igor Sechin, a longtime Putin associate and former Russian deputy prime minister who is now the executive chairman of Rosneft, Russian s leading oil company, a well-placed Western intelligence source tells Yahoo News. That meeting, if confirmed, is viewed as especially problematic by U.S. officials because the Treasury Department in August 2014 named Sechin to a list of Russian officials and businessmen sanctioned over Russia s  illegitimate and unlawful actions in the Ukraine.So now that that the Trump campaign is once again under the microscope for shady Russian ties, they did what they know best: they lied. Page has been listed as a foreign policy adviser to Trump since March. In August, Hope Hicks, spokeswoman for the campaign, confirmed that Carter was an adviser. Now? Communications director Jason Miller told The Hill that Page is  not an adviser and has made no contribution to the campaign. So which is it? The campaign and its spokeswoman have confirmed that Page is in fact an adviser, and now their communications director says he s not nor has he ever been.It s becoming clearer and clearer everyday that the Trump campaign is nothing more than a puppet of the Kremlin and Putin s rich, thuggish buddies. But no, let s continue to talk about Hillary Clinton s pneumonia, because that s way more important than a potentially stolen election by the same people supporting one of the candidates.Featured image via Mark Makaela/Getty Images",News,"September 23, 2016",1

Top Democrat says not clear if Americans helped Russians in election hack,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said on Monday it was not known whether any Americans helped Russia in an alleged hacking campaign aimed at swaying the Nov. 8 election in Donald Trump’s favor. “We do not yet know whether the Russians had the help of U.S. citizens, including people associated with the Trump campaign,” Schiff said at a congressional hearing on possible Russian intervention in the election. It is no crime for Trump or his associates to have ties to Russia, he added.  “On the other hand, if the Trump campaign, or anybody associated with it, aided or abetted the Russians, it would not only be a serious crime, it would also represent one of the most shocking betrayals of our democracy in history,” he said.

Syrian government welcomes committee to discuss constitution,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian government welcomes the formation of a committee that will discuss the current constitution and is expected to be formed at a congress to be convened by Russia in Sochi, Syrian state media said. The congress marks a Russian effort to advance a political solution towards ending Syria s six-year-long war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and forced millions to flee in the worst refugee crisis since World War Two. U.N.-backed talks towards ending the conflict are due to resume in Geneva this week with the participation of the Syrian opposition to President Bashar al-Assad, who is militarily dominant in the conflict thanks to Russia and Iran.  A pro-Damascus newspaper, al-Watan, reported on Monday that the government delegation had postponed its travel to Geneva, saying Damascus was annoyed by the opposition s insistence on its demand that Assad leave power at the start of a transition. In a statement from the Syrian foreign ministry, the Syrian government said it would attend the  national dialogue congress  at the Sochi talks, whose date has yet to be confirmed. Syria welcomed  U.N. participation  in legislative elections to be held after the discussion of the constitution, state media cited a foreign ministry statement as saying. Russian President Vladimir Putin last week won the backing of Turkey and Iran - another ally of Assad - last week to host the congress.  ",worldnews,"November 27, 2017 ",0

[VIDEO] BALTIMORE MAYOR TO POLICE: “Let them loot…it’s only property” Police Demoralized After Being Unable To Respond To 9-11 Calls From Terrorized Business Owners,"The radical Baltimore mayor who ordered the Baltimore Police Department to stand down is now calling for a federal investigation into the Baltimore Police Department. What about a federal investigation into her reckless actions that were clearly motivated by her desire to side with the rioters?? Are we living in some alternate universe where all ability to reason and to use common sense has been removed from our society?Baltimore s streets will likely take years   if not decades   to recover after April s riots that left scores of business owners devastated and local police disheartened. Many cops feel  demoralized, hung out to dry and abandoned,  Fox News  Leland Vittert reported on  Hannity  Monday. There s a sentiment here of  why bother showing up?  Vittert added. Vittert was on the scene at what used to be  ground zero  for the rioting and said he had not seen a single police car during the time he was there. The area is known for drug dealings and gang activity, according to Vittert. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said more than 200 businesses were destroyed in the riots, Fox reported.  So this was your life savings you put into this?  Vittert asked a business owner whose property was destroyed. Exactly, exactly,  the business owner said. He added that his life s work was demolished in 30 minutes by looters and vandals resulting in more than $30,000 worth of damage. Vitter talked to a pharmacy owner who said 99 percent of his store s shelves were ransacked and fears the prescription drugs are now out on the streets.  There were dozens of businesses that were looted, and what was stunning to the business owners themselves is as the looting was going on, they were calling 911,  Vittert said. And, as we have reported, the police did nothing because they had an order from the mayor to  let them loot. It s only property.  Business owners are now faced with the difficult decision of whether to rebuild as they worry they will not be protected from future crime and violence.Via: BizPacReview",left-news,"May 6, 2015",1

U.S. Justice Department says anti-bias law does not protect gay workers," (In this July 27 story, corrects paragraph 7 to reflect that Zarda died in a BASE-jumping accident, not a skydiving accident) By Daniel Wiessner (Reuters) - The Trump administration told a U.S. appeals court that federal law does not ban discrimination against gay employees, a sharp reversal of the position former President Barack Obama took on a key civil rights issue. The U.S. Department of Justice, in a friend of the court brief, told the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on Wednesday that Congress never intended Title VII, which bans sex discrimination in the workplace, to apply to gay workers.  The department also said the court owed no deference to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency that enforces Title VII and has argued since 2012 that the law bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.  The brief came hours after President Donald Trump said he would ban transgender people from serving in the military. That would reverse a 2016 policy adopted by Obama.  Justice Department spokesman Devin O’Malley said the brief was consistent with rulings by 10 federal appeals courts and “reaffirms the Department’s fundamental belief that the courts cannot expand the law beyond what Congress has provided.” The department’s brief was in support of New York skydiving company Altitude Express Inc in a lawsuit filed by a former employee, Donald Zarda.  Zarda claimed he lost his job as a skydiving instructor after he told a customer he was gay and she complained. He died in a BASE-jumping accident after filing the lawsuit. In April, a three-judge 2nd Circuit panel dismissed Zarda’s case, citing a prior ruling that said discrimination against gay workers is not a form of sex discrimination under Title VII. The full court, which can overturn the prior decision, agreed in May to review the case. The issue could reach the U.S. Supreme Court in a different case brought by a former security guard at a Georgia hospital who claims she was harassed and forced to quit because she is gay.  Earlier this month, LGBT rights group Lambda Legal, which represents the former security guard, said it would ask the high court to review the case.  On Wednesday, the Justice Department said employers engage in sex discrimination only when they treat male and female workers differently. Objecting to homosexuality does not depend on sex, the department said, but on moral or religious beliefs. “Of course, if an employer fired only gay men but not gay women (or vice versa), that would be prohibited by Title VII,” the department wrote, “but precisely because it would be discrimination based on sex, not sexual orientation.” Zarda’s lawyer, Gregory Antollino, said on Thursday that the department was making the same arguments the Supreme Court rejected in cases involving discrimination against workers in interracial relationships.

"House approves new Russia sanctions, defying Trump","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to slap new sanctions on Russia and force President Donald Trump to obtain lawmakers’ permission before easing any sanctions on Moscow, in a rare rebuke of the Republican president. It was unclear how quickly the bill would make its way to the White House for Trump to sign into law or veto. The bill still must be passed by the Senate, which is mired in debate over efforts to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system as lawmakers try to clear the decks to leave Washington for their summer recess. The sanctions bill comes as lawmakers investigate possible meddling by Russia in the 2016 presidential election and potential collusion by Republican Trump’s campaign. Moscow has denied it worked to influence the election in Trump’s favor, and he has denied his campaign colluded. The White House said the president had not yet decided whether he would sign the measure. Rejecting the bill - which would potentially hamper his hopes of pursuing improved relations with Moscow - would carry a risk that his veto could be overridden by lawmakers. “While the president supports tough sanctions on North Korea, Iran and Russia, the White House is reviewing the House legislation and awaits a final legislative package for the president’s desk,” said spokeswoman Sarah Sanders. House members backed the bill, which also imposes sanctions on Iran and North Korea, by a near-unanimous margin of 419-3, with strong support from Trump’s fellow Republicans as well as Democrats, despite objections from Trump, who wanted more control over the ability to impose sanctions. The Republican-controlled Senate passed an earlier version of the bill with near-unanimous support. The House added the North Korea measures after becoming frustrated with the Senate’s failure to advance a bill it passed in May. Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the three countries “are threatening vital U.S. interests and destabilizing their neighbors. It is well past time that we forcefully respond.” But the combined bill has run into objections from some senators, who are unhappy that the House added the North Korea sanctions after holding up the measure for more than a month. Senate leaders have not said when they might consider the House bill. Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he was not sure the bill would “fly through” his chamber. “The only language we agreed to was Iran and Russia. So adding North Korea on, I just don’t know how we’re going to deal with it yet,” Corker told reporters. “The better route would have been to send over what had been agreed to.” The bill had raised concerns in the European Union, where U.S. allies depend on supplies of Russian gas. But House members said the bill was tweaked to try to alleviate the worries of Europeans and the energy sector. The intense focus on Russia, involving several congressional probes and a separate investigation by a Justice Department-appointed special counsel, Robert Mueller, has overshadowed Trump’s agenda. The scrutiny has angered and frustrated the president, who calls the investigations a politically motivated witch hunt fueled by Democrats who cannot accept his upset win in last November’s election against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state. Without offering evidence, Trump lashed out on Twitter on Tuesday about “Ukrainian efforts to sabotage” his presidential campaign in order to aid Clinton. The Ukrainian embassy in Washington denied the accusations. The Senate Judiciary Committee had been set to compel Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, to testify at a hearing on Wednesday, but rescinded the subpoena late on Tuesday as negotiations over his participation continued. Manafort has started turning over documents to the committee and is negotiating a date to be interviewed, the panel said in a statement. The committee is looking at a June 2016 meeting in New York with a Russian lawyer organized by Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. Trump Jr. released emails this month that showed he welcomed the prospect of receiving damaging information at the meeting about Clinton. On Friday, the panel had asked that Manafort and Trump Jr. appear at the Wednesday hearing, but a witness list released on Tuesday evening included neither of their names.  Manafort met with Senate Intelligence Committee staff on Tuesday morning, his spokesman said. On Tuesday, Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, spent three hours with the House of Representatives intelligence panel, his second straight day on Capitol Hill answering questions about his contacts with Russians during the campaign. Kushner had a “very productive session” with the House Intelligence Committee, Democratic Representative Adam Schiff said after the meeting. Republican Representative Michael Conaway said Kushner was “straightforward and forthcoming. He wanted to answer every question that we had.” Kushner, who is now a top aide in Trump’s White House, told reporters on Monday he had no part in any Kremlin plot.. U.S. House Republicans on Tuesday rejected a legislative effort by Democrats to obtain Treasury Department documents that could show any ties between the finances of Trump, his inner circle and the Russian government.

"Scenting power, potential Merkel coalition partners edge closer on Europe","BERLIN (Reuters) - Nominally, they are at odds on Europe. But Germany s Greens and liberal Free Democrats (FDP) gave remarkably similar messages on European reform on Monday as they began exploring a coalition alliance with Chancellor Angela Merkel s humbled conservatives. After her conservative bloc hemorrhaged support to the far-right in Sunday s election, Merkel has little choice but to try to work out a three-way coalition with the Greens and FDP - an tie-up untested at national level and widely seen as risky. If their party programs are taken at face value, the Greens want to press ahead with deeper European integration and the FDP wants to hold it back - a conflict that could frustrate coalition talks with Merkel, who wants a  stronger Europe . But at back-to-back news conferences on Monday, the FDP and Greens both made conciliatory noises toward French President Emmanuel Macron, who ran for the French presidency on a pledge to  relaunch  the European Union in tandem with Germany. Macron is due to set out his proposals for EU reform and strengthening monetary union on Tuesday.  We have a great interest in the success of the French republic and in its strength,  FDP leader Christian Lindner told a news conference.   Germany will not become stronger if France becomes weaker, but Europe will profit as a whole if all its members return to a path of economic success. That is why we wish Mr. Macron all the best.  Less than an hour later, Greens co-leader Cem Ozdemir delivered almost exactly the same message.  It is clear that we have a vital interest in France being successful,  he said. The headline comments glossed over deeper differences between the two parties on Europe, but indicated a  glass half full  attitude suggesting both want to find common ground on Europe that will help them forge a ruling coalition with Merkel. Both the FDP and Greens played down the prospect of such a three-way bloc during the election campaign, but as they have been out of government for four and 12 years respectively, they may be lured into an alliance by the prospect of power. Pledging to form a stable government, Merkel herself said she would not set out red lines on Europe policy for now - an open-minded approach that gives the three parliamentary groups wiggle room to work out a compromise.  My view is that we can use more Europe but this has to lead to more competitiveness, more jobs and more clout for the European Union,  she said in a message that could appeal to the pro-business FDP and the Greens, who are keener on regulation.  Merkel also urged the center-left Social Democrats not to shut the door on a re-run of their  grand coalition . The Greens and Free Democrats are from opposition ends of the political spectrum and must navigate differences on tax policy and immigration, as well as Europe, before they team up.  In their party program the Greens say they reject a division of Europe. The FDP, by contrast, favors a  multi-speed Europe  - differentiating a northern core of fiscally disciplined, wealthy member states from the rest.  The FDP wants euro zone countries to be able to leave the bloc rather than stay under an  interminable rescue policy , and favors winding down the lending capacity of the euro zone s ESM rescue fund - unlike Merkel s finance minister, who has proposed developing it into a European monetary fund. Lindner, who said during the election campaign that Greece should leave the euro, said on Monday his party could not agree to a common euro zone budget that would help redress economic imbalances within the bloc. That position seems to be at odds with the vision presented by Macron, who wants to overhaul the euro zone and introduce a budget and finance minister for the single-currency region. The euro EUR= snapped a two-day rising streak on Monday after a surge in support for the far right in the election prompted investors to lock in gains in one of the most profitable currency trades of the year. But investors remained sanguine about the prospects for European reform under a three-way coalition of conservatives, FDP and Greens - known as a  Jamaica  alliance after their respective party colors: black, yellow and green.  Where the FDP might push back on the next potential government s European policies, expect the Greens to pull forward, enabling Chancellor Merkel s middle-ground to prevail,  said Andrew Bosomworth, a senior portfolio manager at Pimco, one of the world s largest bond funds.

 Breitbart Fails HARD In Trying To Prove Polls Are Biased,"We have roughly 92 billion opinion polls going around regarding the presidential election, and right now, they all show Trump and Hillary either locked in a dead heat, or Hillary leading, across the nation and in key states. Of course, this means the polls are rigged, or at least biased, right? Right. So Breitbart, being of sound editorial judgment, commissioned Gravis to conduct their own poll. The results?Hillary leads Trump 42 percent to 37 percent.That s in a four-way race, not a two-way. The poll surveyed 2,832 people on August 9, and carries a 1.8 percent margin of error. So Hillary is outside of even that.Alex Marlow, editor-in-chief at Breitbart, has this to say about their poll: It s an open secret that polls are often manipulated and spun to create momentum for a particular candidate or issue. Breitbart News Network s first national poll marks the start of a major initiative to give our readers an accurate assessment on where the American people stand on the key topics and people of the day   without the mainstream media filter. It s pretty telling when the poll you conducted, with the intent of being as neutral as possible, brings back the same results as the polls you think are biased. This poll has Hillary leading Trump by five percent. In a four-way race, Reuters/Ipsos  most recent poll likewise has Hillary leading by five points, Economist/YouGov has her up by six points, and even Rasmussen Reports has her up by three points.But Trump s crowds are huge and Hillary s aren t, so of course the polls are screwy. Breitbart and Gravis are trying to put a positive spin on it, though, saying that the poll reveals areas where Trump can reach more voters. For some reason, Doug Kaplan, managing partner at Gravis, thinks things like 11 percent support for Trump from the black community presents a problem for Hillary. His rationale seems to be based only on the fact that Hillary has less support from the black community than Obama did in 2012.Hillary also won big when it came to the question,  Do you agree or disagree? Donald Trump/Hillary Clinton would fight for people like me.  Overall, only 39 percent feel that Hillary would fight for them, and Trump had 38 percent of that. However, when it came to Muslims, a stunning 84 percent said they think she ll fight for them.Obviously, Trump won t have that kind of support from the Muslim community. Not with his Islamophobic remarks toward them.Overall, Breitbart walked away from this with egg on their face, because they sought to prove one thing and failed miserably. In the end, all they showed is that either Gravis is biased, too, or that (gasp!) the polls are more accurate than the right would like to believe.Photo of Hillary by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images.

Clinton ramps up Asian outreach in three closely fought states,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign is focusing an effort to win over Asian American voters on three states where it believes the small but rapidly growing group could make the difference in her race against Republican Donald Trump.     The push in closely fought Nevada, Virginia and Pennsylvania follows a broader national effort by Clinton’s campaign to court minorities who are critical to her chances of winning the White House in the Nov. 8 election. Asians make up less than 3.5 percent of the U.S. population, but are the fastest-growing racial group in the country, according to the U.S. Census, due largely to net migration, making them more important than ever in an election.  “Secretary Clinton understands the importance of the AAPI community and has launched a program that reflects that, reaching AAPI voters in unprecedented ways,” said Jason Tengco, the Clinton campaign’s outreach director for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI).  The three states were targeted because Asian voters could swing the outcome in the tight races between Trump and Clinton there.  The effort will include print, digital and broadcast advertising in a handful of Asian languages and more coordination among volunteer groups representing ethnic communities within the Asian American and Pacific Islander group, according to the campaign. Among the recent hires for the effort was Philip Kim, a Los Angeles native who previously worked with Senator Tim Kaine, Clinton’s running mate, as outreach director for Asian American and Pacific Islander voters in Nevada.  The campaign did not say how much the three-state push would cost.     While small, the Asian population could eclipse the margin of victory in each of the states Clinton is targeting. Asians  make up some 2.1 percent of eligible voters in Pennsylvania, 5 percent in Virginia and 9 percent in Nevada, according to APIAVote, a nonpartisan group.  Polling from Reuters/Ipsos shows Clinton with a mere 1 point lead over Trump in Pennsylvania, a 6 point lead in Virginia, and a 2 point lead in Nevada.  The challenge will be to get Asian Americans to the polls. Asian American voters have tended to lean Democrat but register to vote much less frequently than whites and blacks. Asian registration was about 56.3 percent in 2012, according to the Census, versus 73.1 percent for black voters and 71.9 percent for white voters.  The number of Asian Americans voting in presidential elections rose from 2008 to 2012, according to the Census, which showed 4.3 million Asian voters in 2012 and a turnout of 47.9 percent.  “A big part of what we’re doing is voter registration,” said Xochitl Hinojosa, a Clinton spokeswoman. Clinton’s campaign has already done significant Asian outreach. It launched the “AAPI for Hillary” campaign to engage Asian voters in January and has done phone calling in a range of languages for months. But the campaign said the latest push was the first with state-specific programs. The Clinton campaign is considering advertisements in Filipino, Vietnamese, Korean, Hindi, Urdu, Bengali and Chinese.  A spokesperson for Trump’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment about its Asian outreach.  The Trump campaign has, however, recently made some efforts to appeal to black and Latino voters to undercut Clinton, including a meeting on Thursday with Latino and black Republicans in New York. Trump has had problems with minorities in the past and has  angered some with his hardline anti-immigration rhetoric. He has accused Mexico of sending rapists and drug dealers over the border, vowed to build a wall to stop them and called for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration to shore up U.S. national security. Clinton leads Trump by 12 percentage points nationally among likely voters, bolstered by minority support, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. ",politicsNews,"August 25, 2016 ",0
Ukraine detains suspected Russian spy in premier's inner circle,"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine s state security service SBU have detained a government official on suspicion of working in the interests of Russia, Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman said on Thursday.

OBAMA TELLS TROOPS To Rise Up Against Trump…Protest His Authority…Feel Free To Criticize Him [VIDEO],"43 days and counting Characterizing the military s mission as a fight against  violent extremism,  Obama insisted that soldiers need to rise up against Trump if they feel he is pushing policies that are ill considered.Obama told the troops,  each of us has the universal right to speak your minds and to protest against authority; to live in a society that s open and free; that can criticize our president without retribution. Obama went on to insist that a proper U.S. policy against  violent extremism  is a  long term  policy. So rather than offer false promises that we can eliminate terrorism by dropping more bombs or deploying more and more troops or fencing ourselves off from the rest of the world,  Obama said,  we have to take a long view of the terrorist threat. And we have to pursue a smart strategy that can be sustained. In the time remaining, let me just suggest what I think should guide this approach. In addressing the war-torn Middle East, Obama insisted that global warming forms a large part of that conflict.  A changing climate is increasing competition for food and water,  which, he claimed, drives the conflict in Syria and other nearby nations.Obama also blamed the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution for  violent extremism  in the United States. Somebody who is trying to kill and willing to be killed is dangerous, particularly when we live in a country where it s very easy for that person to buy a very powerful weapon,  Obama insisted. The president also defended Islam against the charge of extremism:We are fighting terrorists who claim to fight on behalf of Islam. But they do not speak for over a billion Muslims around the world, and they do not speak for American Muslims including many who wear the uniform of the United States of America s military. If we stigmatize good patriotic Muslims, that just feeds the terrorists  narrative. It fuels the same false grievances they they use to motivate people to kill. If we act like this is a war between the United States and Islam, we re not gonna lose more Americans to terrorist attacks, but we ll also lose the sight of the very principles we claim to defend.As to the rise of ISIS, Obama insisted it was not given aide by his actions of pulling out of Iraq in 2011 but was instead given succor by the policies of George W. Bush. By 2011, Iraqis wanted our military presence to end, and they were unwilling to sign a new status of forces agreement to protect our troops from prosecution if they were trying to defend themselves in Iraq,  Obama proclaimed.

 Trump HUMILIATED As His Approval Rating Is Now Even Lower Than Clinton’s During Sex Scandal,"Donald Trump just beat Bill Clinton at something, and it s very embarrassing.The first six months of Trump s presidency has been a humiliating failure.The scandals, the investigations, the legislative stalls, the infighting, the firings, the whining, and the incompetence have all resulted in an approval rating that is the worst in American history.The ongoing and ever-growing Russia scandal has contributed most to Trump s woes as it has engulfed him and many members of his administration and family, including Jeff Sessions, Donald Trump Jr., and Jared Kushner.But when Newsweek took a look at how Trump s approval ratings compare to Bill Clinton s during his own scandals, the publication discovered that Trump s numbers are even more humiliating.In 1998, Republicans attempted to impeach President Clinton for having an affair with Monica Lewinsky and lying about it under oath. The scandal rocked Washington for months as conservatives salivated over the prospect of ousting Clinton and embarrassing Democrats. Needless to say, the story was national news for months.But Clinton s sex scandal was not nearly as scandalous as Trump s collusion with Russia during the 2016 Election is. That s because Trump s scandal violates our democratic process and is considered treason against the country.Never before had a foreign nation colluded with a candidate s campaign to help them win the presidency.But that s what happened as Trump Jr s own emails demonstrate. As Trump s Russia scandal deepens and the investigations get closer to the truth, Trump is panicking and is desperate to kill the investigation.The scandal has resulted in a record low approval rating of 37 percent, according to the latest Gallup poll.And that number is far lower than anything Clinton received at the height of his own scandal.Newsweek pointed out that Clinton s scandal hit national airwaves on January 21, 1998. Clinton s approval rating, however, climbed to 69 percent by the next month. And it would remain above 60 percent the rest of the year.Throughout the spring and summer months, the scandal dominated cable news and headlines but Clinton would not see his approval rating dip below 60 percent. And come August 1998, Gallup s three polls showed ratings of 64, 65 and 62 percent.Even after the impeachment trial, Clinton s approval rating never fell below 53 percent. Trump began his presidency with 45 percent, and it has only continued to dip.Clearly, Americans care more about the integrity of the democratic process than they do about an extramarital affair.This is not something that Trump is going to brag about. In all likelihood, Trump will seethe over this until he explodes in rage on Twitter, something else that has revolted Americans since he took office.But Trump only has himself to blame. His campaign colluded with the Russians and Trump has spent a lot of time lying about it and trying to obstruct the investigation.When and if Trump does get impeached, he won t have the support of the American people like Clinton did. They will be cheering for his end.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"July 29, 2017",1
Bill to cloak U.S. 'dark money' seen as harmful to charity fraud fight,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fighting charity fraud could become more difficult under a Republican bill in Congress to prohibit the U.S. Internal Revenue Service from collecting the names of top donors to charities and other nonprofit groups, critics warned on Tuesday. Meant to protect the privacy of wealthy individuals who make anonymous, or “dark money” donations to politically active nonprofit groups, the bill would eliminate a decades-old IRS donor-identity disclosure requirement for a range of tax-exempt groups that includes hospitals, universities, community and sports organizations. Backers of the legislation say donor lists have sometimes been disclosed to the public even though the names and addresses are supposed to be private.   In a related development, the IRS itself plans to propose new regulations eliminating donor-reporting requirements for most tax-exempt organizations, according to a document posted on a White House Office of Management and Budget website. It is unclear which groups would still be subject to disclosure under the regulations, which are expected in December.  But either move would deprive resource-strapped state law enforcement authorities of ready information used to look into wrongdoing by charities, state officials told Reuters. “It’s important forensic data to us state regulators. It’s evidence we can consider using in an investigation to determine whether a charity’s board has breached its fiduciary duty,” said Hugh Jones, deputy state attorney general for Hawaii. The Republican measure was approved by a tax committee in April and awaits a House of Representatives vote. If approved it would go next to the Senate, where its outlook was unclear.  With “dark money” and other forms of cash pouring into U.S. politics, the 2016 presidential contest is expected to cost $5 billion, double that of 2012. Campaign committees and political action committees raise most of that cash, but dark money, or spending whose sources are not disclosed, could exceed $500 million this year, up from only $6 million in 2004. Known as 501(c)s for the tax law section that covers them, these groups, under current law, must disclose donor information on a confidential basis to the IRS on Schedule B of tax Form 990. But they do not have to identify their donors publicly, which makes the groups attractive to wealthy, publicity-shy individuals with a political agenda to pursue. Representative Pete Roskam, an Illinois Republican steering the bill, said his measure is needed to protect 501(c) donors from having their identities leaked by the IRS. Such leaks could expose them to intimidation by political adversaries and infringe on their free-speech rights, he said. “The IRS is ill-equipped to deal with sensitive data, and there’s a great deal of vulnerability,” Roskam told Reuters. “Confidentiality breached chills First Amendment rights.”  IRS officials declined to comment. Although Roskam’s bill is geared to address the concerns of political donors, critics say it will have another impact. State authorities investigating charity fraud sometimes ask nonprofit groups for their Schedule B forms, which can help investigators spot conflicts of interest and suspicious movements of money and in-kind donations between charities.  “We would otherwise not have a clue that there was any relationship between charity A and charity B or charity C and D and E and F,” said Karl Emerson, former director of the Pennsylvania Bureau of Charitable Organizations. Experts said charity scams affect at least 1 percent of annual U.S. giving, or about $3.6 billion a year. Backers of the Roskam bill say Schedule B is not widely used in fraud inquiries. “I don’t know of one case where a fraud was proven by the IRS having had the Schedule B,” said David Bossie, president of the conservative group Citizens United. Bossie’s organization won a landmark 2010 Supreme Court case that opened the way to unlimited spending on political campaigns by individuals, corporations, unions and other groups.   Backers of the Roskam bill include Citizens United and billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, who donate to a number of politically active nonprofit groups. The Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity Foundation and other groups argue that government-mandated disclosure of Schedule B information to state authorities is unconstitutional. The groups have filed lawsuits to stop Democratic attorneys general in California and New York from obtaining Schedule Bs as a part of state-level nonprofit registration procedures. In its lawsuit against California Attorney General Kamala Harris, Americans for Prosperity said more than 1,400 Schedule Bs showed up on a public state website, court documents said. The Roskam bill would preserve some disclosure by requiring nonprofits to continue to report contributions from board members, officers and top salaried employees. ",politicsNews,"May 24, 2016 ",0
CONSEQUENCES OF LIBERAL TOLERANCE: He Had An ISIS Flag Hanging From His Roof…Yet No One Reported Him? [VIDEO],"Terrified concert goers fled an Ariana Grande gig after Salman Abedi, 22, detonated a bomb full of shrapnel and nails late on Monday evening.Shocking footage showed carnage brought to the streets of Manchester, with more than 120 people injured in the blast.Disgusting hate cult ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack, and described Abedi as one of their soldiers.And a former neighbour of the suicide bomber believes he could have been a member of the terror group for quite some time.Antone Jones, who lived close to the attacker in the Fallowfield area of the city, described seeing the ISIS flag being draped from the roof of his house.He told the MEN:  I never really knew him well, he always kept himself to himself. But about two years ago there was a black flag on the roof with Arabic writing on it. We never had any idea he was doing anything like this though. He was quiet. Another neighbour, from Gorton, said his manner led him to believe he was a member of ISIS.He said:  He walked past me one evening. He looked at me with his cold black eyes. It was an expression I didn t want to see on a face. He looked at me in a way that suggested he could take care of himself. I said at the time I wouldn t be surprised if he was ISIS.

Trump NATO plan would be sharp break with decades-long U.S. policy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican foreign policy veterans and outside experts warned that the suggestion by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump that he might abandon NATO’s pledge to automatically defend all alliance members could destroy an organization that has helped keep the peace for 66 years and could invite Russian aggression. “Statements like these make the world more dangerous and the United States less safe,” Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a Trump critic who is one of the Republican Party’s leading foreign policy voices and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement on Thursday. “I can only imagine how our allies in NATO, particularly the Baltic states, must feel after reading these comments from Mr. Trump. I’m 100 percent certain how Russian President Putin feels – he’s a very happy man,” he said.Trump’s comments in a New York Times interview “would seem to put him on the same page with Mr. Putin,” Richard Armitage, who was deputy secretary of state in the George W. Bush administration, said in an interview with Reuters. In the New York Times interview, Trump, in response to a question about potential Russian aggression toward the Baltic states - Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia - said that if Moscow attacked them, he would decide whether to come to their aid only after reviewing whether those nations “have fulfilled their obligations to us.” He added, “If they fulfill their obligations to us, the answer is yes.” “It’s the end of NATO,” Robert Hunter, a former U.S. ambassador to the alliance under President Bill Clinton, told Reuters. “The essence of NATO, more than any other single factor, is the commitment of the United States of America to the security of the other 27 members.” Asked about Trump’s comments, European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said the EU knows it needs to “work more on our defense capabilities,” but said the United States needs to keep solidarity with its allies. “It’s very simple to realize that in the world of today, which is quite a complicated one and quite a dangerous one, you need friends,” said Mogherini, who spoke in Washington at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. A letter signed by a bipartisan group of 39 national security experts said Trump’s “inflammatory remarks” do not represent the interests of the United States. “The strength of our alliances is at the core of those interests,” said the group, which includes prominent Republicans such as former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and former State Department official Eliot Cohen. The United States must uphold the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s commitments “to all of our allies, including Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania,” the letter said. U.S. Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the mutual defense commitment was the essence of the Atlantic alliance. But he added that both Republicans and Democrats “are becoming exasperated that most members of the alliance are not honoring their obligations” for military spending, Corker, a Tennessee Republican, said in a statement. Responding to Trump’s suggestion that his decisions would depend in part on whether states that were attacked were meeting their financial commitments to the alliance, former diplomat Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said it is important not to see NATO or any alliance solely in budget terms. “More important is the net benefit the U.S. derives from the stability and security of the country and region affected and the price the U.S. would pay if stability were to be lost or its interests undermined,” Haass told Reuters. Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, which created NATO in 1949 and calls an attack on one member an attack on all, has been invoked once - to help defend the United States after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Following the attacks, NATO sent AWACS planes to patrol over U.S. skies, with more than 800 crew members from 13 NATO countries flying over 360 sorties. As part of the eight measures approved to support the United States, NATO, about three weeks later, sent elements of its Standing Naval Forces to patrol the Eastern Mediterranean and monitor shipping, expanding that to include the entire Mediterranean several months later. A NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also noted that the alliance “deployed a third of the troops in Afghanistan for over a decade, where over one thousand soldiers from non-U.S. NATO allies and partners gave their lives.” Still, some experts downplayed Trump’s comments, even as they criticized them. Kurt Volker, who was U.S. ambassador to NATO under both Republican President George W. Bush and Democratic President Barack Obama, said it was inadvisable to create doubts in adversaries’ minds about the consequences they would face if they invaded a country. “Putin loves it,” Volker said. But he said the general European attitude was to take Trump’s pronouncements with a grain of salt. “Everyone knows it’s an election campaign,” he said. ",politicsNews,"July 21, 2016 ",0
 WATCH: Ben Stein LOSES IT Over Trump’s ‘Sheer Idiocy’ And ‘Horrifying’ Economic Ignorance,"Conservative economist Ben Stein just let everyone know how much he hates Republican front runner Donald Trump. Basically, there aren t enough words to describe how batsh*t crazy Stein thinks Trump is, and how terrifying the leading GOP candidate s lack of experience and ignorance on economics is.In an interview with CNN s Pamela Brown, Stein spoke at length about what he thought of Trump s grand vision for America s economy, after listening to the business mogul spew nonsense about an impeding recession and financial bubble. Stein said: In all of my years as an economist, which is roughly 50 years, I ve never seen such nonsense as we just heard from Mr. Trump. And it breaks my heart, it makes me want to cry because I m Republican, I ve never voted for a Democrat, and to think the guy who s our likely standard bearer has such nonsensical ideas on every single aspect of the economy is just breathtakingly horrible. Stein insisted that Trump has zero clue what he s talking about, and that it s  horrifying . The economist compared Trump s nonsensical  and  breathtakingly horrible rhetoric to being told  men from Mars are coming down  and  he s gonna flap his wings and fly. Stein went even further and said that it was only by  sheer idiocy  that anyone could support Trump s  wacky  ideas.Stein, like many before him, also made sure to point out that Trump s success in business (which isn t much when compared to other wealthy business men and considering all of Trump s failures) in no way qualifies him to speak on economics. Stein found it baffling that Trump doesn t actually have any real economic advisers. You know, I don t know what goes on in his head. He s a force of nature. I don t know what goes on in his head. But it s frightening that he has no economist advisers. Carl Icahn, a very smart guy on Wall Street who s made a great deal of money. Steve Wynn who runs the best hotels in Las Vegas. But as far as economic advisers, as far as I can tell, he doesn t have any and he desperately needs some. The things he s saying are wacky as wacky can be. Just off the charts. You can watch Stein tear into Trump below:Stein s hatred for Trump is so great that the conservative has actually confessed he might switch teams and vote for Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders because he s confident that Trump will  sink  the Republican party.

"Oklahoma governor wants to use reserve fund to shore up schools, prisons","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin on Monday proposed drawing $72 million from the state’s Rainy Day Fund to spare public schools and prisons from severe cutbacks as the oil-rich state grapples with deepening budget cuts linked to the collapse of energy prices. Fallin, a Republican, suggested using $51 million for public schools to prevent a four-day school week and $21 million for the Department of Corrections to head off draconian cuts to prisons.  The Rainy Day Fund contains $385 million, of which $144.4 million is available to address the 2016 fiscal year revenue failure, according to Fallin’s office.   “The deepened revenue failure cuts have changed the budget situation in a way that requires immediate action, so I support accessing the Rainy Day Fund for common education and prisons,” Fallin said.  She said withdrawing from the fund was the most responsible option available to keep vital services at acceptable levels until an agreement on recurring revenues can be reached between the governor and the legislature.   “The Rainy Day Fund option is a one-time fix, but we need to do the tough work to establish a permanent fix in the budget we pass this session,” she said.  Oil-related tax revenue accounted for 10 percent of Oklahoma’s budget at the peak of the shale oil boom in 2014.  The state has already cut spending on education, which accounts for a third of its $7 billion budget, by $25 million in the 2015-2016 fiscal year, and another $20 million cut looms.  On Monday global oil prices jumped more than 5 percent to $40 a barrel, the highest price so far this year.  ",politicsNews,"March 8, 2016 ",0

House Republican group moves to impeach IRS chief: Politico,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of conservative Republicans in the House of Representatives has filed a measure aimed at forcing a vote to impeach Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen, a newspaper reported on Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the plans by the House Freedom Caucus. Members of the group had told House Speaker Paul Ryan they would file a privileged resolution, effectively sidestepping leaders in the Republican-dominated chamber, if he did not agree to start impeachment proceedings in the House Judiciary committee, Politico reported.  Ryan has declined to do so because of doubts the judiciary panel can make an impeachment case against Koskinen. Politico said Louisiana Representative John Fleming filed the motion. Koskinen faces allegations from the judiciary panel of ignoring congressional subpoenas and misleading lawmakers. The accusations stem from a 2013 case in which Republican lawmakers said the IRS scrutinized more conservative groups than liberal organizations in applications for tax-exempt status.

 Iran Proves Republicans Are Full Of Crap As United Nations Says Nuclear Deal Has Been Honored,"Iran is fulfilling their obligations under the nuclear deal reached with the Obama Administration, and Republicans can t handle being proven wrong by those they consider enemies.On Saturday morning, Iran released several Americans from jail. Among them included Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, pastor Saeed Abedini, and former marine Amir Hekmati. As you may recall, Republicans repeatedly used the imprisonment of these three men as a reason to oppose the nuclear deal and demanded that President Obama make their release a condition of the negotiations.But President Obama wisely refused to tangle the two issues, which kept the nuclear deal alive while preserving a future opportunity to bring the prisoners home.And on Saturday, President Obama s wisdom paid off, as all three men have been released just as the deal goes into effect. Not only that, but the United Nations has announced that Iran has honored the terms of the deal in a statement by International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Yukiya Amano.Here is the full statement via the IAEA.Today, I released a report confirming that Iran has completed the necessary preparatory steps to start the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The report was submitted to the IAEA Board of Governors and to the United Nations Security Council.It was issued after Agency inspectors on the ground verified that Iran has carried out all measures required under the JCPOA to enable Implementation Day to occur.This paves the way for the IAEA to begin verifying and monitoring Iran s nuclear-related commitments under the agreement, as requested by the U.N. Security Council and authorised by the IAEA Board.Relations between Iran and the IAEA now enter a new phase. It is an important day for the international community. I congratulate all those who helped make it a reality, especially the group of countries known as the E3/EU+3, Iran and the IAEA Board.In line with its commitments, Iran will start to provisionally implement the Additional Protocol to its Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA. Together with other nuclear-related measures under the JCPOA, this increases the Agency s ability to monitor nuclear activities in Iran and to verify that they are peaceful.We have come a long way since the IAEA first started considering the Iran nuclear issue in 2003. A lot of work has gone into getting us here, and implementation of this agreement will require a similar effort. For our part, we are ready to get on with the job.In other words, Iran met their obligations and showed the world that Republicans were full of bullshit every time they demonized the deal or accused Iran of not cooperating.Even Secretary of State John Kerry took a victory lap around those who doubted the deal would succeed, calling the deal an  ambitious set of promises  that Iran is keeping, which makes the entire world safer. Iran has undertaken significant steps that many, and I do mean many, people doubted would ever come to pass. And that should be recognized, even though the full measure of this achievement can only be realized by assuring continued full compliance in the coming years. Today marks the moment that the Iran nuclear agreement transitions from an ambitious set of promises on paper to measurable action in progress. Today, as a result of the actions taken since last July, the United States, our friends and allies in the Middle East, and the entire world are safer because the threat of the nuclear weapon has been reduced. Clearly, the deal is working and Iran must continue to honor it since other sanctions won t be lifted for another ten years down the road. For now, however, Iran is working with the world and the world is rewarding them by lifting sanctions.This deal will go down in history as one of the greatest achievements of President Obama s time in office, and will go down as a humiliating defeat for Republicans. The GOP hoped to sabotage the deal in preference of war with Iran that would cost thousands of lives and add even more to our national debt. It s likely they are furious that they failed so badly, but they should really be embarrassed that they stood in the way of history and the diplomatic negotiations that brought the deal to fruition. They acted like little toddlers who didn t get their way while the Iranians and President Obama were the adults in the room. And the results make it absolutely clear that Republicans do not have what it takes to lead or make American foreign policy.Featured Image: Tumblr",News,"January 16, 2016",1

U.S. military joins Brazil army exercises in Amazon,"TABATINGA, Brazil (Reuters) - U.S. military personnel are taking part this week in the largest international army operation ever held deep in the Amazon jungle of northern Brazil, in a sign of closer U.S.-Brazil defense ties. Troops from Brazil, Colombia and Peru will set up a temporary military base in their tri-border region for a week-long logistics exercise in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, Brazilian army officials said. About 50 U.S. personnel will be present for the exercise, including 19 observers and 31 members of the Montana Air National Guard who will be based out of Manaus providing air transportation, a U.S. embassy statement said. The United States will provide a Hercules C-130 transport plane to move personnel and equipment, the Brazilian army said. The presence of U.S military personnel in Brazil s Amazon region underscored improving defense relations between the two most populous countries in the Western Hemisphere after more than a decade of distancing under leftist Brazilian governments. In March, then-commander of the U.S. Army South, Major General Clarence K. K. Chinn visited military installations in the Amazon and was decorated in Brasilia. Bilateral agreements on defense cooperation and information security have taken effect recently after years of stalling in Brazil s Congress. The Brazilian general in charge of the operation said he was  astounded  by criticism of the U.S. involvement in the exercise in a globalized world where Brazil maintains good relations with China, Russia and the United States.  It s a senseless conspiracy theory raised by leftist parties,  General Guilherme Theophilo Gaspar de Oliveira, the Brazilian Army s logistics commander, told reporters, as he praised deep U.S. experience and know how in disaster relief.  The Brazilian Army said it was the first time such a large military exercise has been held in the Amazon and would help prepare the armed forces of the three neighboring countries for a humanitarian crisis such as mass migration. Brazil has kept a close eye on economic and political upheaval in neighboring Venezuela that could trigger such an exodus. More than 30,000 Venezuelans have already fled over the border into the northern Brazilian state of Roraima, according to federal police. The Brazilian Army said Venezuela is one of the 19 countries sending observers for the so-called United America Operation. Brazilian Defense Minister Raul Jungmann will attend the jungle exercises on the weekend and then fly to Washington for three days of talks with Pentagon officials, his press representative said.

Last Thursday during an interview on Fox News (of course), Patrick claimed that the protestors who were present at the protest during the shooting were  hypocrites  for running away while shots were being fired. All those protesters last night, they ran the other way, expecting the men and women in blue to turn around and protect them. What hypocrites. I understand the First Amendment. I understand freedom of speech, and I defend it. It is in our Constitution and is in our soul, but you can t go out on social media and mainstream media and everywhere else and say that the police are racist or police are hateful or the police are killers. Calling Black Lives Matter protesters hypocrites for running away when shots are being fired into a crowd   shots that hit both protestors and police   is just plain ugly. From all accounts, the protestors in Dallas and the local law enforcement were working together to make sure that the event was safe. Patrick went on to rant: I do blame people on social media, with their hatred towards police. I do blame, I saw Jesse Jackson   I think it was on Fox the other night   calling police racist without any facts. I do blame former Black Lives Matters protests. Last night was peaceful, but others have not been,  Patrick went on to say.Yeah seriously, Patrick said that. Black Lives Matter is to blame for the actions of one individual who had no previous role in the movement.As far as Patrick s insistence on shutting up about the wholesale slaughter of black lives on social media goes   it s never going to happen. Millions of people are standing up and saying enough is enough. Black lives matter. There are racist police officers out there. Initialized racism must end.You can watch the interview below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNRun_af0h0Featured image from video screenshot",News,"July 9, 2016",1
New Zealand party leaders meet with caucuses to start negotiation talks,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand s major party leaders met with their caucuses on Tuesday, preparing to kick off talks on forming the next government with a nationalist party that holds the balance of power after an inconclusive weekend election. The ruling National Party won the most seats in Saturday s general election, but failed to secure enough to form a government, leaving the New Zealand First Party in the position of kingmaker. Deputy leaders of both the ruling National and opposition Labour parties said they would be willing to give up the role of deputy prime minister to win the backing of Winston Peters, who  leads New Zealand First. But the Labour Party, whose support spiked after Jacinda Ardern became leader last month, also has a chance to govern in New Zealand s proportional representation system, if it can woo Peters into a coalition along with the Green Party. Ardern said she had  every chance  to become the country s youngest prime minister in modern history, adding that her team had contacted that of Peters, a veteran politician who has served in National and Labour governments.  We are willing and available when he is ready,  Ardern, 37, told reporters in Wellington.   I respect the time that Mr. Peters will need to talk with his party.  Asked about possible sticking points in talks, she said budget responsibility rules would apply in any government Labour led.   Both National and Labour are expected to stick to fiscal prudence, but to differ on monetary policy, trade and immigration. Labour wants to cut immigration and renegotiate some trade deals that could hurt two key sources of growth. It wants to add employment to the central bank s inflation-targeting mandate, which could make monetary policy more stimulatory, and there is some concern about New Zealand First s preference for more central bank intervention in the currency market. The political uncertainty weighed on the New Zealand dollar , which was down 0.32 percent at $0.7243, after posting its biggest daily drop in more than four months on Monday. Forming a coalition government could take weeks, Prime Minister Bill English has said, though he hoped talks would be constructive, even if expected to be tense. English has courted Peters since election night, when he acknowledged his  strong performance , saying voters had given him a role in the new government s formation.  He understands his role and the role here is, now that we ve had an election where the people have spoken... then it s up to the political party leaders to form the kind of government indicated by the election,  English told media. The National Party secured 58 seats, ahead of the 52 won by the Green Party and Labour in Saturday s election, leaving both still in need of NZ First s nine seats to reach the tally of 61 required to form a government. A final tally of election results is due on Oct. 7, when  special votes , which constitute 15 percent of the total and include overseas votes, are released. English remains prime minister in the interim. ",worldnews,"September 26, 2017 ",0
China calls for constructive efforts to ease Korean tensions,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China called on Monday for all countries to make constructive efforts to ease tension after North Korea said the latest U.N. sanctions against it are an act of war and tantamount to a complete economic blockade. The U.N. Security Council unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea on Friday for its recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, seeking to limit its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil and its earnings from workers abroad. The U.S.-drafted resolution also caps crude oil supplies to North Korea at 4 million barrels a year and commits the Council to further reductions if it were to conduct another nuclear test or launch another intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). North Korea on Sunday rejected the resolution, calling it an act of war. Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the resolution appropriately strengthened the sanctions but was not designed to affect ordinary people, normal economic exchanges and cooperation, or humanitarian aid.  Hua noted it also called for the use of peaceful means to resolve the issue and that all sides should take steps to reduce tension.  In the present situation, we call on all countries to exercise restraint and make proactive and constructive efforts to ease the tensions on the peninsula and appropriately resolve the issue,  she told a daily news briefing. The North s old allies China and Russia both supported the latest U.N. sanctions. Tension has been rising over North Korea s nuclear and missile programs, which it pursues in defiance of years of U.N. Security Council resolutions, with bellicose rhetoric coming from both Pyongyang and the White House. In November, North Korea demanded a halt to what it called  brutal sanctions , saying a round imposed after its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3 constituted genocide. North Korea on Nov. 29 said it successfully tested a new ICBM that put the U.S. mainland within range of its nuclear weapons. U.S. diplomats have made clear they are seeking a diplomatic solution but proposed the new, tougher sanctions resolution to ratchet up pressure on North Korea s leader. China, with which North Korea does some 90 percent of its trade, has repeatedly called for calm and restraint from all sides and for a return to talks. ",worldnews,"December 25, 2017 ",0
NEW YORK TIMES Publishes Trump Tax Return From 20 Years Ago…TRUMP FIRES BACK!," In a lame effort to score political points for Hillary Clinton, the New York Times published a portion of Donald Trump s 1995 tax return. They re now promoting the idea that Trump  could have  not paid taxes for decades.  Could have  doesn t mean he did! Does anyone care that a man with a huge business empire might try and pay less taxes or work the tax system to his advantage? Isn t that what most people do and it s legal to do it! I would question Trump s sanity if he begged to pay more taxes! The front pages of the tax returns themselves are essentially a non-issue, representing the 1995 gross business loss incurred by candidate Donald Trump who operates a massive conglomeration of business entities.The anti-Trump political angle is easily identifiable within the extensive article use of:  could have ,  might be ,  may have , phrases used throughout the woven narrative. Journalistic  narratives  are rarely based on facts.The identified $916 million single year operating income loss is no different than current losses of Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and a host of other corporations and businesses.Actually, Donald Trump s 1995 loss is smaller than the operating loss the New York Times reported when it sold the Boston Globe in 2013 for a net loss of $1.03 billion.The Times purchased the Boston Globe in  93 for $1.1 billion and sold it in 2013 for $70 million, a loss of $1.03 billion. However, for some reason it s doubtful the Times will publish their own 2013 tax returns. That doesn t meet the political need.THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN RELEASED THIS STATEMENT:Read more: Conservative Treehouse",Government News,"Oct 2, 2016",1
"EYE-OPENING: Why Liberals Won’t Talk About White, Poverty-Stricken, Rural Americans","This is a story you will never find in the mainstream media What seldom gets talked about and when it is, often with irreverent humor and contempt is the poverty of rural America, particularly rural white America: Appalachia, the Ozarks, the Mississippi Delta, the Dakotas, the Rio Grande Valley, the Cotton Belt.If you spend time among coastal liberals, it s not unusual to hear denigrating remarks made about poor  middle Americans  slip out of mouths that are otherwise forthcoming about the injustices of poverty and inequality.Yet, since the 1950s, Americans living in non-metropolitan counties have had a higher rate of poverty than those living in metropolitan areas. According to the 2013 American Community Survey, the poverty rate among rural-dwelling Americans is three percent higher than it is among urban-dwellers. In the South, the poorest region of the country, the rural-urban discrepancy is greatest around eight percent higher in non-metro areas than metro areas.Watch here, as Levi Holstein, 22 explains what Obama s shut down of the coal industry has done to his community: Holstein s youth was spent hunting deer,turkey and bears,fishing for catfish with his father and riding four wheelers through the hills of Boone County. Now,the mountains he grew to love have been leveled in pursuit of coal,and their debris scraped into the hollow above his childhood home,destroying old haunts. I would be the first to tell you I hate strip mines. I hate it,I don t like it one bit,  Holstein said.  But at the same time it gives a man a job. Unfortunately, for 8 years we had a President who was committed to shutting down the coal industry in rural America, where primarily low income white families live.For Holstein,and many others throughout the region,the changes to the landscape and negative environmental impacts are weighed against paychecks to support their families. However,in the past few years career miners have seen their jobs vanish or move to other parts of the state.Once the most formidable industry in West Virginia,coal is progressively losing its economic dominance throughout Central Appalachia as production slows due to tightening pollution controls,greater availability of cheap natural gas and growing competition from other coal basins.From 2007 to 2012 West Virginia s annual coal production dropped by 31.7 million tons annually,falling over 20 percent,from 165.7 million to 129.5 million. Over half of that decline,17.9 million tons,came from Boone County,which until 2012 had long been the state s top producer.So why is the poverty of rural America largely unexamined, even avoided? There are a number of explanations.Rural and urban poverty are similar to the degree that both occur when people do not have access to jobs specifically ones that pay a living wage (i.e. enough to provide themselves and their dependents with basic necessities like food and shelter). Many of the causal factors for poverty, however, are exacerbated in remote areas where the job and labor markets are smaller and less diverse, and communities lack the human capital of city economies. Often a single industry (in some cases single employer) will dominate a vast region.The geographic distance between some rural communities and higher education institutions, as well as technical and vocational schools, is also a factor. According to U.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service, 20 percent of non-metro residents complete their college degrees compared to 30 percent in metropolitan areas.Similarly, when it comes to providing social services in rural America, spatial challenges arise in making those services accessible and visible to a remote public. The repertoire of services available to [rural people] is smaller,  Lobao says. Her research indicates that 50 percent of metropolitan counties provide subsidies for emergency medical services, while only 30 percent of non-metro counties do. Similarly, 30 percent of metro counties make elder care available, but only 20 percent of non-metro counties do. And 25 percent of metro counties provide childcare care, but only 16 percent of non-metro countries do. Each of these deficits contributes to the higher rate of poverty that we see among the rural poor.Lisa Pruitt, a law professor at the University of California at Davis, studies the intersection of law and rural livelihoods. She also runs a site called the Legal Ruralism Blog, where she writes about the problem of rural American poverty. Pruitt grew up in a working-class rural Newton County in the Ozarks of northwest Arkansas. She tells Rural America In These Times that one important misconception about rural poverty is that it is an exclusively white problem. While the majority of rural Americans struggling with poverty are white, Pruitt says, the racial makeup of the rural poor is far more diverse than the image most Americans realize. We tend to associate rural poverty with whiteness,  Pruitt says.  When we think about rural poverty, most associations with rural poverty are with white populations and in fact, that is true to some extent but it s actually far from being monochromatic. The demographics of poverty in rural and urban America are quite similar. Though whites make up the majority of both metropolitan and non-metropolitan populations in the United States resulting in a higher numbers of whites living in poverty poverty rates throughout rural America are much higher among the rural minority population. According to the 2013 American Community Survey, 40 percent of blacks living in non-metro counties fall below the poverty line, compared to 15 percent of whites. Poverty rates among non-metro Hispanics and American Indians are also considerably higher than they are among whites.This popular association between rural American poverty and whiteness is key to understanding why the media, and liberal America as a whole, doesn t talk about rural American poverty. While black poverty in the United States is attributed to the legacies of slavery, Jim Crow, housing discrimination, incarceration, and other forms of institutionalized racism, we have no national narrative that explains white poverty. As a result, there is an implicit belief that whites who have benefited from all of the advantages that come with being white don t have a good reason to be poor. In other words, that when whites live in poverty, it is their fault, or even their choice.Since the 1960s, the current U.S. economic system has had as a constant feature 15 percent of the population living below the poverty line. For better or worse,  says Pruitt,  when we talk about poverty, we focus on black poverty, and we focus on Hispanic poverty. We ve collapsed our nation s poverty problem into our nation s racism problem and it leads us to turn a blind eye to rural poverty. One of Pruitt s overarching arguments is that this political polarization between the liberal mainstream and the rural poor is self-perpetuating, and will only worsen with time as the rural poor are  excluded from the pipeline to power. There is such a disconnect between the people in power in this country and the rural poor. It s a negative feedback loop,  says Pruitt.  If you re deciding who you are going to admit to Harvard and you see they grew up socio-economically disadvantaged from rural America, the knee-jerk reaction is,  We don t want those people among us. They re racist. They re uncouth. They re unsavory.   Though the left has all but cornered the subject of poverty and its myriad dimensions, the fact that rural Americans tend to espouse conservative positions on social issues like abortion and gay rights does not make the liberal media or Democratic candidates any more sympathetic to rural American poverty. And if the 2008 Presidential Election is any indicator, poor rural Americans, especially whites, feel increasingly at odds with liberal politics and liberal candidates. I think the assumption is that rural white voters are racist and illiberal and intolerant,  says Pruitt.  And so there are all sorts of incentives to distance ourselves for the Democratic presidential candidates to distances themselves from rural whites. I think that most rural white voters are pretty alienated from politics generally, and the Democratic Party in particular. Yet the left and working class rural Americans have many reasons to forge a stronger relationship specifically in challenging the authority of corporate America and growing the bargaining power of workers. Lobao, clearly frustrated, says rural sociologists have spent a lot of time thinking about how the left could appeal to rural Americans and often find themselves mired in  platitudes. The one thing that we could stress in terms of social values is the value of building community,  she said.    Do you like your community? Do you want to build it? Well why can t we?  We can try to emphasize building the community, you know, because people identify with their community whether they re Republican or Democrat.  Via: In These Times",Government News,"Jan 18, 2016",1

"Trump interviews four for Fed chair job, to decide in two-three weeks","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is ramping up his search for a new chief for the U.S. central bank, meeting with former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh and three others and promising a decision next month. “I’ve had four meetings for Fed chairman and I’ll be making a decision over the next two or three weeks,” Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn. Trump has previously suggested he may reappoint Fed Chair Janet Yellen to the post. Jerome Powell, one of the current governors on the Fed’s board, also met with Trump earlier this week about the Fed job, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. Trump on Friday did not provide details on his meetings.  A new Fed chair would take the helm as the central bank eases well away from crisis-era policies in response to a strengthening economy and falling unemployment, though inflation still lingers below the Fed’s 2-percent goal. Under Yellen, the Fed has raised interest rates and launched a plan to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. Much of the latter was accumulated through a controversial bond-buying program that Yellen said helped the economy avert an even deeper downturn. Her term as chair expires in February.  Warsh was a Fed governor between 2006 and 2011 and resigned from the board because of his opposition to the bond-buying program. He has called for a revamp of how the Fed makes monetary policy, saying it needs “fresh air” from markets and from the “real economy.”  Treasury yields spurted higher on news of the Trump meetings; Warsh is viewed as more of a hawk than Yellen. “He’s definitely more hawkish on the spectrum. He is quite a contrast to Yellen. It does seem he is the front-runner even though it’s not a sure thing he will be nominated,” Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rates strategist at TD Securities in New York, said of Warsh. As recently as July, Trump had not ruled out reappointing Yellen, telling the Wall Street Journal that he liked her demeanor and desire to keep interest rates low. In addition to Warsh and Powell, Stanford University economist John Taylor’s name also has been floated as a contender. Powell specialized in financial regulatory matters during his five years on the Fed Board of Governors, which is led by the Fed chair. There has also been speculation that Trump could turn to his top economic aide, Gary Cohn, for the Fed chair position. A Fed spokesman declined to comment on the process while Warsh and Taylor did not respond to requests for comment.  ",politicsNews,"September 29, 2017 ",0
PRO-LIFE LICENSE PLATE DEEMED ‘Patently Offensive’ BY FEDERAL APPEALS COURT,"Because after all, what s more offensive than choosing to allow your baby to live?The pro-life message can be classified as  patently offensive,  a federal appeals court ruled last week. The new opinion came as a three-judge panel ruled that New York state was right to reject a  Choose Life  license plate on the grounds that it may grate on New Yorkers  political sensibilities.The judges split on whether New York could deny a pro-adoption group the right to have its own license plate, although the state has in the past allowed plates endorsing political causes associated with the liberal viewpoint, such as environmentalism.Judge Rosemary Pooler, who was appointed by President Clinton, wrote that the state s denial did not harm anyone s right to freedom of expression, because drivers  may display a  Choose Life  bumper sticker   or even cover every available square inch of their vehicle with such stickers. That message will resonate just as loudly as if vehicle displayed a  Choose Life  license plate. Judge Debra Ann Livingston, a President George W. Bush appointee, wrote in her dissent that  a proposed custom plate depicting a sun and two smiling children, and bearing the words,  Choose Life  [thought] to be  patently offensive  was  surprising. Pro-adoption organizations should have the same speech rights as any other organization. While the district court affirmed this basic freedom, the circuit court denied free speech in favor of government censorship,  said Jeremy Tedesco, senior counsel at ADF.  The state doesn t have the authority to target The Children First Foundation specialty plates for censorship based on its life-affirming viewpoint. The ruling is the lastest round in a legal battle that has raged for more than a decade and, pro-lifers say, seen state officials repeatedly suppress their First Amendment rights.The Children First Foundation applied for the specialty license plate in 2002, but state officials say the message and design was  too controversial.  In 2004, the Alliance Defending Freedom filed a lawsuit on CFF s behalf.New York s Department of Motor Vehicles repeatedly denied the  Choose Life  license plates on the grounds that the message was  patently offensive. The same appeals court rejected an effort to suppress the plates made by then-Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and agreed that Albany officials denied the plates based on viewpoint discrimination.Via: LifeSite News ",left-news,"May 27, 2015",1
Polish president says 'multi-speed' EU will lead to break-up of bloc,"KRYNICA-ZDROJ, Poland (Reuters) - The European Union will become less attractive to some member states if it implements a  multi-speed  vision and the bloc will ultimately break up, Polish President Andrzej Duda said on Tuesday. Deeper eurozone integration is sometimes called a  multi-speed  Europe because it would create different speeds of convergence within the 28-member bloc. Poland and other eastern EU states say they fear it could reduce their influence, financial support and competitiveness.  A division of the Union into a multi-speed union will not be beneficial ... politically, will not be beneficial economically,  Duda told an economic forum in Poland s southern city of Krynica-Zdroj.   In my opinion it will ultimately lead to a break-up of the European Union,  he said, adding that all member states would be hurt in such a scenario. Europe-wide polls show Poles are one of the most pro-EU societies, even though they overwhelmingly oppose adopting the euro currency.Duda also said EU support could falter in member states that do not participate in deeper eurozone integration. The remark appeared to suggest he believes EU support could fall in Poland. Duda is an ally of the ruling eurosceptic Law and Justice (PiS) party.  If EU membership becomes less attractive for countries that are thrown out of the first decision-making circle, then this moment in my opinion will be the actual beginning of the end of the union,  Duda said.  Sooner or later the societies of states that today view the EU positively ... will feel rejected and support for the EU will decline, which will result in further Brexits,  Duda said. Since PiS won an election in 2015, the government has clashed with the European Commission over issues ranging from its refusal to accept EU migrant relocation quotas to the ruling conservatives  tightening grip on the judiciary and media. French President Emmanuel Macron, one of the most vocal supporters of deeper integration within the euro zone, said in August that Warsaw was moving in the opposite direction to Europe on numerous issues and would not be able to dictate Europe s future. Poland rejected the accusations, saying Macron was inexperienced and arrogant. Macron also wants the EU to tighten its rules on the employment abroad of labor from low-pay nations, which could threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs performed by Polish employees in richer western EU states.

Hezbollah says Saudi Arabia forced Lebanese PM to quit,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon s Shi ite Hezbollah group on Sunday accused Saudi Arabia of forcing Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri to quit, and called for calm in an effort to contain the political crisis unleashed by his resignation. Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Iran-backed Hezbollah, said there should be no political escalation in response to Hariri s declaration on Saturday, which was made from Saudi Arabia and came as surprise even to his aides. Hariri, in a televised speech, said there was a plot to kill him, and accused Hezbollah and its Iranian backers of sowing strife in the Arab world.    Nasrallah said  legitimate questions  were being asked over whether Hariri had been detained in Saudi Arabia, where news emerged on Sunday that royals, ministers and investors had been arrested in an anti-corruption purge. Aides to Hariri, whose family made their fortune in the Saudi construction industry, strongly denied he had been detained or had been forced to resign. Speaking in a televised address, Nasrallah said:  The resignation was a Saudi decision dictated to Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri and was forced on him.  Nasrallah said Lebanon s political leaders expected Hariri to return to Lebanon on Thursday  if he is allowed  to travel.  Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, a political ally of Hariri, is locked in a bitter tussle for power across the Middle East with Shi ite Iran and its allies, including Hezbollah. Lebanese President Michel Aoun will not accept Hariri s resignation until he returns to Lebanon to explain his reasons, palace sources said on Sunday, delaying for now the politically difficult consultations over his successor.  Nasrallah said he would not comment on accusations leveled against Hezbollah by Hariri, describing his resignation announcement as a Saudi statement. Hariri s resignation toppled a coalition government that included Hezbollah, thrusting Lebanon back into the frontline of the Saudi-Iranian regional rivalry and risking an open-ended political crisis.  The government was formed late last year in a political deal that ended years of deadlock, and last month it produced Lebanon s first budget since 2005. Nasrallah said he had thought things were going well and had not wanted Hariri to quit.  Hariri allies in Lebanon have denied suggestions he had been detained and a photograph was published on his Twitter account showing him with Saudi Arabia s newly appointed ambassador to Lebanon, Walid al-Yaaqoub. News of high-level arrests in Saudi Arabia fueled social media speculation in Lebanon that Hariri, a Saudi national, was a target. Nasrallah said  there was legitimate concern , asking if Hariri had anything to do  with this internal struggle between the princes .    Saudi Oger, the construction firm owned by the Hariri family, has faced a multibillion-dollar debt restructuring. The company was hit by a decline in oil prices led to sharp state spending cuts in the kingdom.     Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq al-Awsat cited unnamed sources close to Hariri as speculating that he would probably remain outside Lebanon because of the security threat against him. Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh sought to calm fears the political turmoil would hit Lebanon s already fragile economy, issuing a statement to reaffirm the stability of its currency, which is pegged against the U.S. dollar.    In Lebanon s sectarian system the president must be a Maronite Catholic, the prime minister a Sunni and the speaker of parliament a Shi ite. Hariri is Lebanon s most influential Sunni politician. His father, Rafik al-Hariri, was prime minister after Lebanon s 1975-1990 civil war and was assassinated in a car bombing in 2005.  A U.N.-backed tribunal has indicted five Hezbollah members for the killing but the group denies any involvement.  Saudi media have published reports of a plot to assassinate Hariri in recent days, but all of Lebanon s main security branches have said they have no information about such a plot. A Saudi minister said on Saturday that Hariri s personal security detail had  confirmed information  about the plot. Thamer al-Sabhan said in an interview with a Lebanese TV station on Saturday that there were  threats against the prime minister and the kingdom is keen for his security . U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was concerned by Hariri s resignation and hoped all sides in the country would back its state institutions, his spokesman on Lebanon Stephane Dujarric said in an emailed statement.

EU's diplomatic back channel in Pyongyang goes cold,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - While European powers France and Britain are lobbying Washington to cool tensions since North Korea s most powerful nuclear test a month ago, EU nations with embassies in Pyongyang are directly pressing the North Koreans.   A group of seven European Union countries - the Czech Republic, Sweden, Poland, Romania and Bulgaria, as well as Britain and Germany - held at least two formal meetings with North Korean officials in Pyongyang in September, three EU diplomats said.  But they felt frustrated because the higher-level access that they had obtained in Pyongyang last year had fallen away, with only medium-ranking foreign ministry officials now attending the meetings, the diplomats said.  There was a sense that we weren t really getting anywhere because they sent these department heads,  said a Brussels-based diplomat who had been briefed on the meetings, which were described as  very serious  in atmosphere and tone.   They want to talk to the United States.  The White House has ruled out such talks, with President Donald Trump telling Secretary of State Rex Tillerson he would be  wasting his time  negotiating with the North Koreans. The United States has no embassy in Pyongyang and relies on Sweden, the so-called U.S. protecting power there, to do consular work, especially when Westerners get into trouble.  In contrast to recent meetings, when North Korean officials met EU envoys in the Czech Republic s embassy in 2016 to discuss issues including cultural programs and regional security, a deputy foreign minister would attend, one EU diplomat said.  For the small club of European Union governments with embassies in North Korea, that reflects Pyongyang s anger at the EU s gradually expanding sanctions that go beyond those agreed by the United Nations Security Council.  It could have repercussions for broader EU efforts to help mediate in the nuclear crisis, according to the EU diplomats briefed by their colleagues in Pyongyang, as the bloc prepares more measures against North Korea. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, who chaired talks on the historic 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, says the bloc is ready to mediate in any talks aimed at freezing North Korea s missile and nuclear weapons programs. But at the same time, the European Union wants an oil embargo on Pyongyang that it hopes other countries will follow.  Some EU governments are pushing to cancel North Korean work permits in Poland and other eastern European countries because EU officials believe workers  salaries are deposited in bank accounts controlled by the regime in Pyongyang.  The North Koreans are starting to see the EU as a U.S. puppet, but we stress that we are an honest broker,  said a second EU diplomat.  Links with the EU embassies go back years. Communist Czechoslovakia was a leading supplier of heavy machinery to North Korea. As a Soviet satellite, Czechoslovakia established diplomatic ties with North Korea in 1948, along with Poland and Romania.  The seven European embassies in Pyongyang are among only 24 foreign missions there, including Russia, China and Cuba. The EU s status as a potential broker relies, in part, on Sweden, which was the first Western European nation to establish diplomatic relations with the North in 1973. Sweden is a member of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, which was set up to oversee the 1953 armistice between North and South Korea, undertake inspections, observe military exercises and promote trust between the two sides. Czechoslovakia was also a member of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission until the early 1990s.  Sweden played a key role in the release of Canadian pastor Hyeon Soo Lim and of U.S. student Otto Warmbier earlier this year. But Sweden has strongly backed the EU sanctions.  The seven European embassies are limited in what they can say because North Korean staff, required by the government to work at the EU embassies, are expected to double as informants for Pyongyang, the diplomats said.  Sanctions and pressure ... Sadly, we don t have anything else,  said an EU diplomat in Brussels. The joint meetings with the North Koreans, usually held at a single European mission, have been focused on the release of imprisoned Westerners, not big diplomatic initiatives. But as efforts intensify to calm U.S. and North Korean threats of war, they could still prove an important channel to pass messages between Pyongyang and Washington.  In the best case, we could perhaps facilitate an opening of a diplomatic track between the North Koreans and the United States,  said Carl Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister and foreign minister from 2006 to 2014. Bildt said anything the EU does must be kept secret.  If the EU does something along these lines, the first thing the EU should do is not to talk about it. Talking about it is a pretty good way to ensure that one can t do it,  he said. Mathieu Duchatel, a North Korea expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank that Bildt also now helps oversee, said the European Union could chair talks between China and the United States. Washington and Pyongyang have no hotlines to prevent crises from spinning out of control and it is not clear what Beijing s reaction would be if the United States intercepted a North Korean missile test, Duchatel said. For now, Paris is in contact with White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, diplomats said, noting French President Emmanuel Macron s budding relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump.  Lieutenant General McMaster and Kelly, a retired four-star Marine Corps general, have a soft spot for France born of their admiration for the French military, the diplomats said. It is unclear if that translates into a direct impact on Trump s thinking on North Korea, European diplomats said.  They are trying to normalize Trump, but I don t think Trump can be normalized,  said a senior French diplomat.  To get him to listen, heads of state need to speak to him directly.  Macron, who has ruled out a military option, has said he believes he could convince Trump to avoid armed intervention. Macron s position is to keep repeating the mantra of patience and dialogue to Trump, diplomats said. ",worldnews,"October 3, 2017 ",0
" Republicans Turn On Trump, Throw Him Under The Bus For F*cking Up Health Care Plan (DETAILS)","When Republicans celebrated Donald Trump s undeserved election victory, they probably never imagined he d damage the party as badly as he already has in just nine weeks.This week, Trump once again embarrassed the GOP by messing up their first attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare. Not only did Trump fail to sell the disastrous American Health Care Act, but he pulled the bill on Friday. Understandably, Republicans are pissed that Trump conducted things this way, and are distancing themselves from him more than ever. In fact, they re blaming him and saying that he and the White House had been an obstacle from the start, setting them up for failure. One House Republican (who wanted to remain anonymous) said: Their heart was not in the healthcare battle. Think about the level of intensity on the executive orders for the travel ban, or on the wiretapping claims. He certainly checked the boxes on healthcare, to his credit. But it s self-evident there was not a certain level of intensity devoted to this. Trump and his minions have countered this claim, with Press Secretary Sean Spicer issuing a statement on Saturday: The president and vice president left everything on the field  They were making calls and having members to the White House all week. In total, we spoke or met with over 120 members of Congress. And yet, this doesn t seem to add up, considering that Trump s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner were nowhere to be found as sh*t was hitting the fan on Friday. Kushner, who is one of Trump s key advisors, was actually skiing with Ivanka in Aspen as House Republicans tried to pass their horrible health care bill and failed. And it s not just Kushner they re pissed at   it s Trump himself.According to House staffers and other GOPers, Trump didn t seem focused when in meetings concerning the Obamacare repeal. Another unnamed Republican said: Halfway through that meeting, he stopped to talk about Gorsuch. His mind was bouncing around. I never felt they were dialed into this. Maybe next time the GOP will think twice about letting a five-year-old become their party s nominee. What we re witnessing here is the breakdown of the Republican Party, and it s so humiliating that we almost feel bad for them. Almost.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"March 25, 2017",1
Trump's war chest one of smallest in recent presidential campaigns,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump could go down as the least well-funded presidential candidate in recent campaigns - entering the final month of the election still without the cash to match the level of staff and advertising that has helped power the campaign of his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. With less than three weeks until the election, it is too late for Trump to amass the amount of cash he would need to unleash a spending assault that might turn his hobbled campaign around. Through the end of September, Trump raised a total of $163 million - a far cry from Clinton’s $449 million. Trump, a New York real estate developer who has boasted about his wealth, pledged to use millions of his personal assets to fund his campaign. In addition to the $163 million raised, he put in $47.5 million during the primary and then added another $8.6 million. Trump’s fundraising deficit has resulted from a series of campaign crises that made wealthy donors reluctant to contribute to his campaign and reflects that he does not enjoy working the fundraising circuit or calling large-dollar donors to ask them to write checks. That’s a big disadvantage for Trump. And it shows in how he has been outspent trying to win the Nov. 8 election for the White House, particularly in the two largest spending categories: staff and television commercials. When it comes to staff, Trump has spent $5 million, compared with Clinton’s spending of about $38 million.  Trump had 168 people on his payroll in September, more than doubling the 82 he had on staff in July. Additionally, Trump spent $5 million on field consultants, part-time workers who are not part of the main staff. Clinton had 815 people on her staff in September.  On advertising, Trump has spent $48.7 million while Clinton has spent $204 million - allowing her to blanket the airwaves with a deluge of advertisements. It has also allowed Clinton to inject more money into states that have become closer as Election Day nears. Earlier this week, Clinton’s campaign announced it was spending an additional $2 million in Arizona, a late-game decision to try to win a traditionally Republican state that now appears within her grasp. Overall, Trump has spent about $190 million by the end of September, compared with Clinton’s $401 million.  Trump and Clinton can collect donations up to $5,400 from a single individual, but can also collect larger checks that are then divided between the campaign and joint fundraisers with the national and state parties.  The funds that candidates raise for the national and state political parties are still used for the common effort of hiring staff and getting voters to turn out to the polls. But those funds cannot be used in the most direct parts of running a campaign, like buying television ads or hiring staff that report to the campaign manager. Trump’s campaign struggled to get organized and build out the infrastructure that is needed to be competitive in the key battleground states. Instead, Trump has been dependent on the infrastructure built by the Republican Party. Trump has raised $244 million through joint fundraising committees with the national parties, of which he got $71 million.  By comparison, Clinton has raised $415 million through joint fundraisers, of which $117 million went to her campaign. Since 2008, major party presidential candidates have stopped accepting public funding for their general election campaigns - which placed limits on the amount a candidate could raise and spend. But even the last candidate to accept public funds, Senator John McCain in 2008, raised more that year than Trump did this election. McCain raised more than $300 million. That same year, Barack Obama, in his first presidential race, raised $607 million. In 2012, Mitt Romney raised more than $337 million at this point in the campaign. And Obama had raised $564 million.  ",politicsNews,"October 21, 2016 ",0

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Is it legal for a sitting President to be ""wire tapping"" a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Drawing on sources including the New York Times and the Washington Post, Levin described the case against Obama so far, based on what is already publicly known. The expanded version of the case can be found here.Here is an important portion of that case: October: FISA request. The Obama administration submits a new, narrow request to the FISA court, now focused on a computer server in Trump Tower suspected of links to Russian banks. No evidence is found   but the wiretaps continue, ostensibly for national security reasons, Andrew McCarthy at National Review later notes. The Obama administration is now monitoring an opposing presidential campaign using the high-tech surveillance powers of the federal intelligence services.January 2017: Buzzfeed/CNN dossier. Buzzfeed releases, and CNN reports, a supposed intelligence  dossier  compiled by a foreign former spy. It purports to show continuous contact between Russia and the Trump campaign, and says that the Russians have compromising information about Trump. None of the allegations can be verified and some are proven false. Several media outlets claim that they had been aware of the dossier for months and that it had been circulating in Washington.January: Obama expands NSA sharing. As Michael Walsh later notes, and as the New York Times reports, the outgoing Obama administration  expanded the power of the National Security Agency to share globally intercepted personal communications with the government s 16 other intelligence agencies before applying privacy protections.  The new powers, and reduced protections, could make it easier for intelligence on private citizens to be circulated improperly or leaked.January: Times report. The New York Times reports, on the eve of Inauguration Day, that several agencies   the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Treasury Department are monitoring several associates of the Trump campaign suspected of Russian ties. Other news outlets also report the exisentence of  a multiagency working group to coordinate investigations across the government,  though it is unclear how they found out, since the investigations would have been secret and involved classified information.February: Mike Flynn scandal. Reports emerge that the FBI intercepted a conversation in 2016 between future National Security Adviser Michael Flynn   then a private citizen   and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The intercept supposedly was part of routine spying on the ambassador, not monitoring of the Trump campaign. The FBI transcripts reportedly show the two discussing Obama s newly-imposed sanctions on Russia, though Flynn earlier denied discussing them. Sally Yates, whom Trump would later fire as acting Attorney General for insubordination, is involved in the investigation. In the end, Flynn resigns over having misled Vice President Mike Pence (perhaps inadvertently) about the content of the conversation.February: Times claims extensive Russian contacts. The New York Times cites  four current and former American officials  in reporting that the Trump campaign had  repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials. The Trump campaign denies the claims   and the Times admits that there is  no evidence  of coordination between the campaign and the Russians. The White House and some congressional Republicans begin to raise questions about illegal intelligence leaks.March: the Washington Post targets Jeff Sessions. The Washington Post reports that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had contact twice with the Russian ambassador during the campaign   once at a Heritage Foundation event and once at a meeting in Sessions s Senate office. The Post suggests that the two meetings contradict Sessions s testimony at his confirmation hearings that he had no contacts with the Russians, though in context (not presented by the Post) it was clear he meant in his capacity as a campaign surrogate, and that he was responding to claims in the  dossier  of ongoing contacts. The New York Times, in covering the story, adds that the Obama White House  rushed to preserve  intelligence related to alleged Russian links with the Trump campaign. By  preserve  it really means  disseminate : officials spread evidence throughout other government agencies  to leave a clear trail of intelligence for government investigators  and perhaps the media as well.In summary: the Obama administration sought, and eventually obtained, authorization to eavesdrop on the Trump campaign; continued monitoring the Trump team even when no evidence of wrongdoing was found; then relaxed the NSA rules to allow evidence to be shared widely within the government, virtually ensuring that the information, including the conversations of private citizens, would be leaked to the media.Levin called the effort a  silent coup  by the Obama administration and demanded that it be investigated.In addition, Levin castigated Republicans in Congress for focusing their attention on Trump and Attorney General Sessions rather than Obama.  Breitbart NewsPresident Trump also used Twitter to build his case against the Democrats and how they are attempting to unfairly trash the reputation of Jeff Sessions,  an honest man :Jeff Sessions is an honest man. He did not say anything wrong. He could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2017 intentional.

SHOCKING! HERE’S HOW OFTEN Airlines Bump Passengers From Flights [Video],"Who knew that the Department of Transportation keeps records on how many people are bumped involuntarily from a flight. Can you guess the numbers?Airlines have always bumped passengers from overbooked flights but with the recent a** kicking of a passenger on a United Airlines flight (see below), you probably never thought of it. Here s what we know:If you ve flown much then you know that airlines overbook flights. When that happens, they usually offer free tickets to anyone willing to give up their seat.In this case, EVERYONE wanted to stay on the plane including one man who eventually had to be physically tossed off by uniformed men He claimed to be a doctor and needed to get home to see patients in the morning. We re sure you ll hear more about this man but we can t verify that he s a doctor. We just find it odd that he would endure this treatment by the security at the airport. It was a disturbing situation for sure!In the fine print when you buy your ticket, the airline reserves the right to toss you if they re over booked This isn t the way to do it! Does anyone else out there REALLY miss the good old days of flying? I do!Flying these days can be a nightmare check this one out:A United passenger was forcibly removed from a flight from Chicago to Louisville after he refused to voluntarily give up his seat.Fellow passengers on the flight posted jarring videos late Sunday night of uniformed men dragging the man off of the flight after what United called an  overbook situation. Flight 3411 from Chicago to Louisville was overbooked,  a United spokesperson told Yahoo News when asked about the incident.  After our team looked for volunteers, one customer refused to leave the aircraft voluntarily and law enforcement was asked to come to the gate. Audra D. Bridges and Tyler Bridges posted video of the incident:@united @FoxNews @CNN not a good way to treat a Doctor trying to get to work because they overbooked pic.twitter.com/sj9oHk94Ik  Tyler Bridges (@Tyler_Bridges) April 9, 2017ANOTHER ANGLE:@United overbook #flight3411 and decided to force random passengers off the plane. Here s how they did it: pic.twitter.com/QfefM8X2cW  Jayse D. Anspach (@JayseDavid) April 10, 2017Bridges and Anspach gave similar accounts of the incident to the Louisville Courier-Journal and on Twitter: United had overbooked the flight and was looking for four volunteers to leave the plane in order to send four United crew members to Louisville. Passengers were allowed to board and United offered $800 to anyone who gave up their seat, but when there were no volunteers, United said a computer would randomly select four passengers. The man in the video claimed to be a doctor who had patients to see in the morning and refused to leave, at which point airport security dragged him off the plane.The United Contract of Carriage lays out specific policies for passengers who are not allowed to board overbooked flights but doesn t cite policy for removing passengers who are already seated on such flights.Via: Yahoo",Government News,"Apr 11, 2017",1
Russian hacker wanted by U.S. tells court he worked for Putin's party,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian hacker arrested in Spain on a U.S. warrant said on Thursday he previously worked for President Vladimir Putin s United Russia party and feared he would be tortured and killed if extradited, RIA news agency reported. Peter Levashov was arrested while on holiday in Barcelona in April. U.S. prosecutors later charged him with hacking offences, accusing him of operating a network of tens of thousands of infected computers used by cyber criminals. Levashov s comments offered a rare glimpse into the relationship between cyber criminals and the Russian state. U.S. officials say Russian authorities routinely shield hackers from prosecution abroad before recruiting them for espionage work. Russian hackers have been under intense scrutiny since U.S. intelligence officials accused Moscow of interfering in last year s U.S. presidential election. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied the allegations.   U.S. prosecutors are seeking a 52-year jail sentence and Levashov, who denies the charges against him, is fighting his extradition from Spain. He told a court in Madrid on Thursday that he had worked for the United Russia party for the last 10 years.  I collected different information about opposition parties and delivered it to the necessary people at the necessary time,  RIA quoted him as saying. Levashov provided no further details about his work for the party, RIA reported, though said he was an officer in the Russian army with access to classified information.  It was unclear if Levashov was a serving officer or an army reservist having completed mandatory military service.  He also told the court investigators in the United States would torture him for information about his political work if he was sent there to face the charges against him.  If I go to the U.S., I will die in a year. They want to get information of a military nature and about the United Russia party,  RIA quoted him as saying.  I will be tortured, within a year I will be killed, or I will kill myself.  Levashov has long been seen by cyber security investigators to be the person behind an online persona known as Peter Severa. Severa spent years listed among the world s 10 most prolific spammers, according to spam-tracking group Spamhaus. U.S. prosecutors have accused Levashov of running the infamous Kelihos botnet, a network of more than 100,000 infected devices used by cyber criminals to distribute viruses, ransomware, phishing emails and other spam attacks. Russia lodged its own request for Levashov s extradition last week, RIA reported. ",worldnews,"September 28, 2017 ",0

 WaPo: Trump Tried To Get Sessions To Let Racist Sheriff Joe Arpaio Off The Hook Months Ago,"Donald Trump just threw a match on this tinder box of a nation when he decided to pardon former Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio. This guy is a racist who was convicted in court of contempt for refusing to follow an order to stop racially profiling and detaining people. Arpaio terrorized that county for years with impunity and without consequence, and now it seems that he will be able to carry on being awful.Now, there is even more nefarious news out there regarding this. It seems that Trump tried to get Jeff Sessions  Department of Justice to let Arpaio off the hook by dropping the case against him altogether. It seems that Sessions told Trump that such an action would not be the appropriate thing to do. Having no other choice, Trump waited until Arpaio was convicted, and THEN decided to wait for the perfect time to issue a pardon. One White House official says of Trump s thinking on the Arpaio matter: We knew the president wanted to do this for some time now and had worked to prepare for whenever the moment may come. Of course, we mustn t forget that Arpaio and Trump have been political partners in crime ever since they started the birtherism nonsense, in which they promoted the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States. They both doggedly tried to prove that the nation s first Black President was not a legitimate Commander-in-Chief   all because he s Black.In short, they are two racist peas in a pod, so of course Trump wasn t going to let his man go to jail, even though if there was ever someone who deserves to rot in jail, it s this racist, abusive former Sheriff.One good thing came out of this, though: It showed that when Trump is willing to do something truly egregious, the Department of Justice has maintained at least a little independence and is willing to push back. However, in this instance, said pushback had no real effect.Come on, Congress, Mueller, whomever   please get rid of this lawless president while we still have a nation left.Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images",News,"August 26, 2017",1
LORD’S PRAYER AD BANNED…One Month Later Muslims Get “Praise Allah” Signs Approved,"This will be America if we don t push back! London red buses will have a Muslim sign saying  Praise Allah  when Christian signs have been banned. Religious freedom is what America was founded on so it would be a great idea to watch for signs of censorship of Christianity here in America as it has totally changed the UK.BUS adverts are set to carry a slogan praising Allah just months after a clip featuring the Lord s prayer was banned from cinemas.The slogan reads  Subhan Allah    which translates as  Glory be to God    and will feature on hundreds of buses across the country as part of a campaign by the Islamic Relief.The group have targeted the ad campaign to raise money for victims of the Syrian Civil War during the holy month of Ramadan in June, when muslims traditionally fast and give to charity.But the campaign has caused anger among some Christian groups after an advert featuring the lords prayer was banned from UK cinemas in the run up to Christmas.The advert, which featured the Archbishop of Canterbury along with a variety of parishioners reciting the Lord s prayer, was banned from Odean, Cineworld and Vue cinema.Former Tory MP Ann Widdecombe said:  If other religions are allowed to put their religious banners up, then so should Christians.

U.N. team to collect evidence of Islamic State crimes in Iraq,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council on Thursday approved the creation of a U.N. investigative team to collect, preserve and store evidence in Iraq of acts by Islamic State that may be war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide. The 15-member council unanimously adopted a British-drafted resolution, after a year of negotiations with Iraq, that asks Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to establish a team  to support domestic efforts  to hold the militants accountable. British Minister of State for the Middle East Alistair Burt said Britain would provide some $1.3 million to help establish the team.  There can never be adequate recompense for those who were forced to endure the wanton brutality of (Islamic State) and the dead will not be brought back, but this resolution means that the international community is united in our belief that there should, at least, be accountability,  Burt told the council. Use of the evidence collected by the team in other venues, such as international courts, would  be determined in agreement with the Government of Iraq on a case-by-case basis.  Evidence is for primary use by Iraqi authorities, followed by  competent national-level courts,  according to the resolution. Thousands of foreigners have fought with Islamic State and some are already being prosecuted when they return home.  U.N. experts said in June last year that Islamic State was committing genocide against the Yazidis in Syria and Iraq to destroy the minority religious community through killings, sexual slavery and other crimes. International human rights lawyer Amal Clooney and Nadia Murad, a young Yazidi woman who was enslaved and raped by Islamic State fighters in Mosul, have long pushed Iraq to allow U.N. investigators to help. Clooney and Murad, who were both in the Security Council for Thursday s vote, described the resolution as a milestone in the fight for justice.  Nadia and I exchanged a warm smile when we saw the 15 hands go up in the chamber,  Clooney told Reuters.   It s been a long time coming; in the meantime, evidence has been lost and we ve lost some opportunities along the way, but the fact that we have this resolution now means that justice is finally possible,  she said. Murad said she was  very happy  the council had acted.  The Security Council met during the annual gathering of world leaders for the U.N. General Assembly.  We look ahead to the next steps and it s really the next steps that will define whether this piece of paper we acquired today will become real justice on the ground for Yazidis and other victims of ISIS,  Clooney said. Iraq s foreign minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari officially requested international help in a letter to the Security Council last month. The council could have established an inquiry without Iraq s consent, but Britain wanted Iraq s approval. Islamic State s self-proclaimed caliphate effectively collapsed in July, when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces completed the recapture of Mosul, the militants  capital in northern Iraq, after a nine-month campaign.

Macron taps author Slimani as French language emissary,"PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron on Monday named award-winning author Leila Slimani as France s top emissary for promoting the use of the French language. The appointment of the 36-year old Franco-Moroccan writer as emissary for Francophone affairs follows Macron s decision to name a TV presenter and well-known ecologist as environment minister and an Olympic fencer as sports minister, opening up government to civil society.  Slimani was propelled into the limelight when she won the prestigious Prix Goncourt last year for her novel  Chanson Douce , which translates as lullaby. This year, she published a book about sexuality in Morocco.   The Francophone affairs brief has in the past been a ministerial post or a junior minister position, and had often been occupied by career politicians.  Macron, whose upstart centrist party trounced France s traditional political forces in an election earlier this year, has named a series of newcomers to his government.  Nicolas Hulot was appointed energy and environment minister, while Laura Flessel-Colovic, an Olympic gold medalist, is minister for sports.  ",worldnews,"November 6, 2017 ",0

The Saudi-led military coalition fighting the Iran-aligned armed Houthi movement in Yemen s civil war started a blockade of ports a month ago after Saudi Arabia intercepted a missile fired toward its capital Riyadh from Yemen.  Although the blockade later eased and showed signs of breaking on Wednesday, Yemen s situation remained dire. About 8 million people are on the brink of famine with outbreaks of cholera and diphtheria.  I have directed officials in my administration to call the leadership of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to request that they completely allow food, fuel, water and medicine to reach the Yemeni people who desperately need it,  Trump said in a statement, without elaborating.  This must be done for humanitarian reasons immediately,  Trump said. The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said the first food and fuel had arrived in Hodeidah and Saleef ports, but supplies were at a trickle compared to what was needed, since Yemen s population of 27 million was almost entirely reliant on imports for food, fuel and medicine.  Oxfam International applauded Trump s statement, calling it  long overdue but hugely important.  Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, who has called for restrictions on U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia, said he expected the Kingdom to heed Trump s call. Trump s brief, one-paragraph statement is one of the clearest signs of U.S. concern over aspects of Saudi Arabia s foreign policy. Saudi Arabia has also split with Trump over his decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Publicly, Trump, his top aides and senior Saudi officials have hailed what they say is a major improvement in U.S.-Saudi ties compared with relations under former President Barack Obama, who upset the Saudis by sealing a nuclear deal with their arch-foe Iran. Even as ties improve, however, U.S. diplomats and intelligence analysts privately express anxiety over some of the more hawkish actions by Saudi Arabia s crown prince, especially toward Yemen and Lebanon, as Saudi Arabia seeks to contain Iranian influence. In turn, Saudi Arabia has been unusually public about its concerns over U.S. policy on Jerusalem.  King Salman told Trump ahead of his Jerusalem announcement on Wednesday that any decision on the status of Jerusalem before a permanent peace settlement was reached would  harm peace talks and increase tensions in the area,  according to Saudi state-owned media. A White House official said Trump s statement on aid to Yemen did not represent retaliation for the Saudi position on Jerusalem.   It has to do with the fact that there is a serious humanitarian issue in Yemen and the Saudis should and can do more,  the official said. The fuel shortages caused by the blockade have meant that areas hardest hit by war, malnutrition and cholera lack functioning hospital generators, cooking fuel and water pumps. It also makes it harder to move food and medical aid around the country.  The Saudi-led military coalition stepped up air strikes on Yemen s Houthis on Wednesday as the armed movement tightened its grip on Sanaa a day after the son of slain former president Ali Abdullah Saleh vowed revenge for his father s death. Saleh, who was killed in an attack on his convoy, plunged Yemen deeper into turmoil last week by switching allegiance after years helping the Houthis win control of much of northern Yemen, including the capital.  U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Tuesday that the killing of Saleh would likely worsen an already dire humanitarian situation in the country in the short term.  This is where we ve all got to roll up our sleeves and figure out what you re going to do about medicine and food and clean water, cholera,  Mattis said. ",worldnews,"December 6, 2017 ",0
WOW! Kellyanne Conway’s “MISTAKE” Forced Leftist Media To Expose What REALLY Happened In Bowling Green…And The TRUTH About These Iraqi “Refugees” Is P.R. Nightmare For The Left [VIDEO],"President Donald Trump s Senior Counselor Kellyanne Conway clarified a comment in which she mistakenly referred to a  Bowling Green Massacre. She said Friday on Twitter that she meant to say  terrorists  instead of  massacre,  referencing a 2013 ABC News story on two suspected terrorists living as refugees in Kentucky.According to the story:  The discovery in 2009 of two al Qaeda-Iraq terrorists living as refugees in Bowling Green, Kentucky   who later admitted in court that they d attacked U.S. soldiers in Iraq   prompted the bureau to assign hundreds of specialists to an around-the-clock effort aimed at checking its archive of 100,000 improvised explosive devices collected in the war zones, known as IEDs, for other suspected terrorists  fingerprints. An undercover FBI operation exposes Al Qaeda terrorists posing as refugees in the middle of the American heartland. They quickly learned the laxed background checks were to blame. But it turns out that may be just the beginning. There may be dozens more now in this country as well.The video below shows an admitted Al Qaeda terrorist who had already killed American soldiers in Iraq, trying to get weapons to kill more of them. And Authorities tell ABC News he may be just one of dozens of men with American blood on their hands where mistakenly allowed to settle in the US as refugees.The two men came from Iraq 4 years ago among tens of thousands of refugees who the State Department approved to come here, seen as  no threat to the US . But the two were in fact, as the FBI says part of an Al Qaeda connected insurgent group that had already killed American soldiers with road side bombs.

"Senate revises Russia sanctions bill, sends it to House","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate resolved a technical issue on Thursday that had stalled a new package of sanctions on Russia but the measure faces opposition in the House that could mean more delays, lawmakers said. The Countering Iran’s Destabilizing Activities Act, which also includes the Russia sanctions, passed the Senate in a 98-2 vote on June 15.   Many lawmakers hoped the bill would become law in time to send a strong message to Russian President Vladimir Putin before President Donald Trump’s meeting with him in Germany next week.  But the Senate bill stalled when House Republican leaders said it violated a constitutional requirement that legislation affecting revenues originate in the House, known as a “blue slip” violation. Lawmakers from the two chambers have bickered about it since. Democrats accused House Republicans of trying to kill the bill to please Trump after administration officials said they had concerns about it. House Republican leaders insisted their objection was solely a procedural one. “The speaker has made clear that we will take up sanctions once the House receives it,” said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Speaker Paul Ryan. The Senate resolved the procedural issue on Thursday. But the delay means the House will not vote until after the G20, because of Congress’ recess next week. “This is now going to be a referendum on the Republican leadership, if they are going to go along with the president’s coddling of Putin and the Russians, then that will have to be their legacy,” said Representative Eliot Engel, the top House Foreign Affairs Committee Democrat. Engel and Republican committee chairman Ed Royce have said they want the sanctions passed quickly. Some House Republicans have reservations. Representative Pete Sessions, whose home state of Texas is central to U.S. energy, said he wanted assurances about how the bill would affect businesses. Representative Mark Meadows said he would look at the bill closely after hearing from the Italian, German and British ambassadors, who had energy-related concerns. “It could potentially run into trouble. But it’s too early to tell,” Meadows said. The legislation would put into law sanctions previously established via ex-President Barack Obama’s executive orders. It includes sanctions on mining and other industries, and targets Russians responsible for cyber attacks or supplying weapons to Syria’s government. It also sets up a review process that would require Trump to get Congress’ approval before easing sanctions on Russia. ",politicsNews,"June 29, 2017 ",0

"Aboard rickety boats or swimming, over 750 Rohingya reach Bangladesh","COX S BAZAR/YANGON (Reuters) - They came in boats, others on flimsy rafts, some even swam. Around 750 Rohingya Muslims made their escape from Myanmar on Friday to reach Bangladesh, where the greatest danger is malnutrition and disease in teeming refugee camps. Over 613,000 Rohingya have already taken refuge in the camps since a Myanmar military clearance operation forced them to abandon their villages in northern Rakhine State. Rohingya who have reached Bangladesh have recounted horror stories of rape and murder. A top U.N. official described the military s actions as  ethnic cleansing , though Myanmar denied that, saying its operation was needed for national security after Rohingya militants attacked 30 security posts on Aug. 25. Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto leader of Myanmar s less than two-year-old administration, was in Vietnam on Friday, attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. She was expected to hold talks with several leaders on the sidelines of the gathering, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Having won the Nobel Peace Prize for defying the generals who ruled predominantly Buddhist Myanmar with an iron fist for nearly half a century, Suu Kyi s reputation as a stateswoman has suffered due to her failure to speak out more strongly over the Rohingya crisis. Under a constitution written before the junta gave way, the civilian administration still has to share power with the generals, and has little say over defense and security issues. Still, leaders at APEC, and two other regional summits to be hosted by the Philippines in the coming days, are expected to exert pressure on Suu Kyi to do more to stem the crisis. And on Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will meet with Suu Kyi in Naypyitaw, the Myanmar capital, with senators back in Washington pressing to impose sanctions targeting the military. International Rescue Committee, the leading aid agency headquartered in New York and led by former British foreign minister David Miliband, reckoned that up to two-thirds of the  300,000 Rohingya remaining in Myanmar will join the exodus to Bangladesh in the coming months. The IRC in a statement highlighted the extremely dangerous health conditions for Rohingya living in camps in the port city of Cox s Bazar. A nutrition survey led by its partner Action Contre la Faim had found 40,000 Rohingya children faced malnutrition and required life-saving assistance. It said 95 percent of the population was drinking contaminated water - and agencies had reported that two-thirds of Cox s Bazar s water was contaminated with faeces.   The conditions we are seeing in Cox s Bazaar create a perfect storm for a public health crisis on an unimaginable scale,  said Cat Mahony, the IRC s emergency response director in Cox s Bazar.   The situation will only deteriorate with more arrivals and a greater strain on already overstretched resources.  Trail of destruction: tmsnrt.rs/2y8FgQ8 Still, Rohingya too scared to stay in Myanmar were ready to risk their lives crossing the waters around the mouth of the Naf river to reach Bangladesh. They were helped on Friday by another day of calm seas, though more than 200 have drowned attempting the crossing during the past two months. Bangladesh officials said significant numbers were arriving on rafts they had built from bamboo, lashing plastic jerrycans to the poles for extra buoyancy. They said more Rohingya had swum across on Thursday. A Reuters photographer saw up to ten rafts landing on the beaches of Teknaf, at the southern tip of Cox s Bazar, on Friday. People reaching the shore have told Reuters that there are thousands living in desperate conditions on the strand of beach by the river s mouth at Pa Nyaung Pin Gyi, as they waited for a chance to cross over.  Dil Muhammad, 30, from Buthidaung, one of the Rakhine regions that bore the brunt of the military operation, finally made it across with his wife and three children after weeks of living on the sand because he could not afford to pay a boatman.  I stayed in Pa Nyaung Pin Gyi for two months because I didn t have money to come,  he told Reuters.  Dil Mohammed said his 18 month old daughter was suffering from diarrhea and a fever.  I couldn t get to a doctor as we were stuck in that place.  And Sakhina Khatun, a woman of 35, said that three men who had been with her on the other side had been attacked by  Buddhists  when they went to search for bamboo to make a raft. Border Guard Bangladesh officials counted 444 refugees coming ashore at Sabrang, near Teknaf, and 150 more arriving further along the coast. Afruzul Haque Tutul, additional superintendent of police in Cox s Bazar said his officers had rescued 125 Rohingya from a wooden fishing boat stranded off Inani beach and bussed them to the camps.

Dozens of U.S. lawmakers request briefing on Yahoo email scanning,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of 48 lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday asked the Obama administration to brief Congress “as soon as possible” about a 2015 Yahoo YHOO.O  program to scan all of its users’ incoming email at the behest of the government. The request comes amid scrutiny by privacy advocates and civil liberties groups about the legal authority and technical nature of the surveillance program, first revealed by Reuters last week. Custom software was installed to search messages to hundreds of millions of accounts under an order issued by the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. “As legislators, it is our responsibility to have accurate information about the intelligence activities conducted by the federal government,” according to the letter, organized by Republican Representative Justin Amash of Michigan and Democratic Representative Ted Lieu of California. “Accordingly, we request information and a briefing as soon as possible for all members of Congress to resolve the issues raised by these reports.” Investigators searched for messages that contained a single piece of digital content linked to a foreign state sponsor of terrorism, sources have told Reuters, though the nature of the content remains unclear. Intelligence officials said Yahoo modified existing systems used to stop child pornography and filter spam messages on its email service.  But three former Yahoo employees told Reuters the court-ordered search was done by a module buried deep near the core of the company’s email server operation system, far below where mail sorting was handled. The Senate and House intelligence committees were given a copy of the order when it was issued last year, sources said, but other members of Congress have express concern at the scope of the email scanning. Some legal experts have questioned the breadth of the court order and whether it runs afoul of the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches. Half of registered U.S. voters believe the Yahoo program violated the privacy of customers, according to a poll of 1,989 people conducted last week by Morning Consult, a polling and media company. Twenty-five percent were supportive of the program because of its potential to stop criminal acts, the survey found, while another quarter did not know or had no opinion. The congressional letter is addressed to Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. ",politicsNews,"October 14, 2016 ",0

Hillary Is Free To Run For President While DECORATED MARINE HERO FORCED OUT For Sending An Urgent Email Warning To Fellow Marines From Personal Server,"Is it Hillary s political privilege that allows her to go unpunished for her criminal activity? Hillary was just given a pass to run for the highest office in our nation by the FBI after sending an untold number of highly classified emails from her personal server, while a Marine who served four tours of duty overseas sent one classified email from his personal server in an effort the save the lives of his fellow Marines and he is forced out of the military. But then again, the Clinton Crime Family is never subject to the same rules as We The Peasants The deck is stacked in favor of those at the top. Everyday Americans need a champion.  -Hillary ClintonU.S. Marine Corps Captain Jason C. Brezler, a decorated Marine officer who has deployed four times, faces being discharged from the Corps he loves because he used his personal email to send a single classified report as an urgent warning when lives were at stake.Meanwhile Intelligence Inspectors General (IGs) found two top secret documents out of a randomly-picked set of forty from Hillary Clinton s emails   and she is being allowed to continue her campaign with little or a no consequence and, generally, the story is being ignored by the mainstream media.As reported by the left-wing Daily Beast, on July 25, 2012, U.S. Marine Corps Captain Jason C. Brezler was in the U.S. attending grad school. In fact, he was in class when received an email about Sarwar Jan, the former police chief who Brezler helped to remove from office. The email was from Marine Major Andrew Terrell, who served with Brezler in 2010. Jan, as police chief, was a notorious drug and weapons trafficker and a friend of the Taliban who ran a child kidnapping/rape ring on the side. Terrell s email said that the former police chief had returned to the area where they served, near FOB Delhi in Afghanistan. The accompanying message from Terrell read,  Jason, I just got an email from one of my friends in Afghanistan; he just met Sarwar Jan. He is looking for anything we have on him. Do you still have that paper Larissa wrote on this guy in Now Zad? It could be very helpful. Anything you can think of would be useful. Thanks brother, Andrew. Larissa Mihalisko was a Marine intelligence officer who had prepared a report on Jan with information provided by Brezler and Terrell. Brezler had kept a copy along with other necessary operation reports on the personal laptop he used in the war zone, the Marines not having provided him one.Now, in the moments after he received the urgent message from Terrell, Brezler decided it was great luck that he had downloaded the hard drive from that laptop onto his new one. I immediately typed  search  and  Sarwar Jan  and uploaded the document,  he would recall in court papers.In the next instant, he sent the report to the email address that Terrell had provided for another Marine in Afghanistan. He gave no thought to the document s classification.  Major Jason Brezler s email with the classified information sent to FOB Delhi was meant to be an alarm about Sarwar Jan   but, it was ignored. Soon after, three Marines working out at the base s gym were shot and killed  by an Afghan teen brought on the base by the same corrupt and double-dealing pedophile police chief whom Brezler had declared to be an immediate threat. Marine Maj. Jason Brezler sent an email to 3rd Battalion, 8th Marines (stationed at FOB Delhi) before the shootings about a corrupt Afghan cop named Sarwar Jan, who was allegedly raping Ainuddin before the 2012 murders. SARWAR JAN IS BACK In 2012 Major Brian Donlon was a captain, serving as 3rd Battalion, 8th Marines operations officer in Afghanistan. According to an email chain obtained by Blue Force Tracker, Donlon sent an email to Captain Andrew Terrell on July 23, 2012   18 days before the FOB Delhi shootings   requesting information about Sarwar Jan. Do you remember the Now Zad DCOP, Sarwar Jan?  Donlon wrote.  If yes, tell me about him. He just showed up. Brian, I sent this request out to Jason Brezler my civil affairs officer for Now Zad. He has some of the detailed reports we submitted on this guy (Sarwar Jan). The short version is he is extremely corrupt, only serves himself, has a proven record of failure [ ] He (Sarwar Jan) has sold out to the Taliban several times before, I would not trust him with anything. After Terrell sent the request for additional information to Brezler, he contacted Donlon to update him on the request:On July 24, 2012, Brezler logged into his Yahoo email account; he was attending graduate school in Oklahoma at the time. He saw an email from Terrell titled:  IMPORTANT! Sarwar Jan is back! Brezler hurriedly responded to Donlon with all the information he had on Jan   inadvertently including classified information about the Afghan police chief in the email sent from his unsecured Yahoo account.Donlon, in turn, replied to Terrell that he would have to report Brezler for violating the military s rules on classified information  spillage. I am going to have to report this to our OPSEC guy,  Donlon wrote.  Dammit, I know he was just trying to help but shit, he can t have this stuff on there. Donlon s reply to Terrell, however, made no mention of the actual content of Brezler s warning about Jan, nor did he say whether he had forwarded Brezler s warning on to units at FOB Delhi.After Donlon questioned Brezler about sending the classified document over an unsecure network, Brezler reported his offense to his superiors. A Naval Criminal Investigation was launched into the classified data spillage. Brezler cooperated with NCIS investigators, turning over his laptop and materials, which, he claimed he accidently took home following a 2010 deployment to Afghanistan. At that time in Afghanistan, Brezler said, Marines had to use their own personal computers to handle classified material due to limited resourcesBrezler knew the document had been classified, but he figured that had likely changed with the passage of time. And he was only passing on to a fellow Marine what he and Terrell had reported in the first place. But he could tell that the other Marine [who received his email] was taking it as a breach of security. Brezler had still been in class during all this. He continued to live by the Naval Academy honor code, and he used the lunch break to call a Marine higher-up to report himself.Brezler was later referred to a board of inquiry for sending his warning about Jan, which included classified information, over an unclassified network. Although a subsequent Marine Corps investigation determined that Jan did not play a direct role in the 2012 murders, Buckley s family and platoon mates still think Jan was culpable and are pressing to discover whether Brezler s warning was either ignored or overlooked at a time when the threat of  green on blue  attacks on U.S. and NATO military personnel in Afghanistan was at the highest point of the war.Here s the sick part. The only one who is being punished for that act is U.S. Marine Corps Captain Jason C. Brezler, a decorated Marine officer who has deployed four times, who now faces being discharged from the Corps he loves because he used his personal email to send a single classified report as an urgent warning when lives were at stake   and who followed up by self-reporting his breaking of rules.At first, his only punishment was a reprimand, but when the families of the three marines murdered in the gym began to complain that they were being told nothing about the death of their loved ones, Captain Brezler reached out to Rep. Peter King (R-NY) for help.Suddenly, some of the Marine brass decided that a reprimand was not enough. Brezler could not help but notice that nobody was being investigated for failing to act on the report itself. I do not know, and cannot understand, how Jan was ever permitted to operate again with, in proximity to, Marine forces, let alone assume a command on a Marine FOB with an entourage of chai boys,  Brezler said in court papers.  Had senior Marine commanders paid attention to the dossier we prepared when we expelled Jan from Now Zad, or the Marine commanders responsible for FOB Delhi acted on the warning I sent in response to their urgent request, I believe the Marines murdered on FOB Delhi would be alive today.  The commanders who messed up weren t punished, but the Captain who loved being a Marine is being drummed out of the Corps, unless Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus sets the decision aside.Now, compare the case of Captain Brezler to that of Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. As Secretary of State, against the rules, she used a private email server so she could keep all the emails to herself. Over that private server, she sent classified information. When others discovered the private server, she denied it ever held classified information, and she selected which emails to turn over   and then had her server wiped clean. After months of refusing, Ms. Clinton finally turned her server over the FBI. So far, she is getting off without even a reprimand and the mainstream media is protecting her.Captain Brezler, on the other hand, sent one classified document in an attempt to save the lives of other Marines. When he realized his mistake, he reported himself. As soon as he was asked, he turned his computer and thumb drive to his superiors. And, when the subject of the three marines who were killed was brought up by their grieving families, he didn t go talk to them, he spoke to a U.S. Congressman who had clearance because he was on the intelligence committee. Now, Captain Brezler is being forced out of the Marine Corps the loves.As the author of the Daily Beast piece concludes:Brezler has continued to serve with distinction as a member of Rescue 2 of the FDNY. A retired firefighter named Jimmy Boyle ran into him the other day and called out a question many are asking. Hey, Jason, what did you do that Hillary didn t?  Via: MRCTV",politics,"Jul 6, 2016",1

Tensions lurk behind Pence's 'partnership' visit to Indonesia,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Washington has billed Vice President Mike Pence’s visit to Indonesia next week as a booster for the Strategic Partnership between the world’s second- and third-largest democracies, but a raft of bilateral tensions could sap the goodwill from his trip. Pence’s counterpart in the world’s most populous Muslim country has voiced worries about U.S. President Donald Trump’s immigration policy, which critics say is biased against Muslims, and about his “America First” mantra on trade and investment. “We in Indonesia never change. The change is there. That’s why we’re asking them now, ‘what is your policy now on the economy, on democracy, now that Trump is in power?’,” Vice President Jusuf Kalla told Reuters on March 31.   “What does it mean, ‘America first’? I can say, too, ‘Indonesia first’ if you say ‘America first’.” Indonesia is one of 16 countries against which the United States runs a trade deficit that will be investigated by the Trump administration for possible trade abuses. Trump’s combative approach will not sit easily with Indonesia, where economic nationalism and protectionist tendencies have flourished since a slump in commodity prices in recent years slammed the brakes on economic growth. “Unfortunately I do see a hardening of attitudes on our side,” said a senior Indonesian government official, who declined to be named. “And it’s of particular concern because we’re on that list of 16 countries ... that are going to be investigated.” The official said a tougher stand by Indonesian authorities had also contributed to a series of disputes with U.S. companies, including Alphabet Inc’s Google, miner Freeport-McMoRan Inc and financial services giant JP Morgan Chase & Co. A SERIES OF FACE-OFFS Indonesia has dueled with Google over back taxes and fines running into hundreds of millions of dollars, and with Freeport in a contract row that has crippled operations at the world’s second-largest copper mine, Grasberg. It also dropped JP Morgan as a primary bond dealer after the bank’s research analysts issued a negative report on the country in November. “It’s a very unfortunate series of issues which all happen to be American,” said the official, who expects them to come up in private during Pence’s visit. Indonesia is the third stop on an April 15-25 tour that includes South Korea, Japan and Australia. Google declined to comment for this report, and JPMorgan did not respond to a request for comment. Freeport Indonesia spokesman Riza Pratama said: “This visit is happening entirely independent of our current negotiations with the government of Indonesia.” However, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, Freeport’s third-biggest shareholder and now a special adviser to Trump, has described Jakarta’s tactics over the mining contract as “disingenuous and insulting”, according to the New York Times. Another potential irritant is biodiesel.  The U.S. National Biodiesel Board (NBB), a producer group, has petitioned the U.S. government to impose anti-dumping duties on biodiesel from Indonesia and Argentina, claiming they have flooded the U.S. market. “This is one of the issues that we have asked the trade ministry to bring to the meeting (with Pence),” Paulus Tjakrawan, a director at the Indonesia Biofuel Producers Association, told Reuters.  “Our hope is for the government to be firm ... Otherwise we will be taken advantage of,” he said. “Not to act like thugs but, for example, if they put barriers to our exports, why not stop importing some of their goods?” Despite the strains, the government official said Indonesia would be careful to start its relationship with the Trump administration on the right foot. Indonesian President Joko Widodo’s approach to foreign policy has been led more by economic interests than geopolitical considerations: he has pursued increased trade and investment from China but keeps a diplomatic distance from Beijing and established a strategic partnership with Washington under former President Barack Obama. U.S. ambassador to Indonesia, Joseph R. Donovan Jr, said in a statement last week that Pence’s visit reflected a continued commitment to that partnership, would deepen economic engagement and boost regional security cooperation. “The U.S. embassy here certainly is going to great lengths to make the visit a success,” said the Indonesian official. “My impression is he’s (Pence) not going to ruffle feathers in public, he’s not going to cause a ruckus.”             ",politicsNews,"April 13, 2017 ",0

TRUMP DITCHES PRESS To Make “Last Minute” Surprise Trip,"President-elect Donald Trump played a round of golf at his Jupiter golf course Saturday morning   without notifying the traveling press pool that traditionally reports on his whereabouts. According to media reports, Trump headed to his Trump National Golf Club sometime in the morning. The golf course sits off Donald Ross Road about a half-hour drive north of Trump s Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, where he and his family have been spending time for the Christmas and New Year s holidays. Mar-a-Lago was slated to host its lavish annual New Year s gala later Saturday.A club member tweeted a photo of Trump on the course, saying he was accompanied by about 25 Secret Service agents, The Associated Press reported.David Markus of Miami was spending some time at the golf club to celebrate the New Year s holiday when he and his family spotted Trump. He snapped a few photos of Trump, including one with Markus  three daughters taken near the club s pool. Markus said Trump started his golf game around 9:30 a.m. and ate lunch around 2 p.m. before leaving the club.Trump s golf outing was  a last-minute decision to play We are in the home stretch of this transition period and don t anticipate any additional situations like this between now and inauguration,  Grisham said in a statement to the AP.

AN ELECTION WARNING EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD READ: “Think of what the last eight years have wrought then pitch America forward to 2024”,"As I ve said for years   on radio, TV and in print   for me the overriding issue in American politics is the corruption. In the Obama era, we have seen the remorseless merging of the party and the state   in the IRS, in the Justice Department and elsewhere. Whatever one feels about, say, Scandinavia, they at least come to their statism and socialism more or less honestly. Not so the United States.It s bad enough that Democrats aren t agitated about this corruption   but then it works to their advantage. Slightly more mysterious is why so many of my friends on the right aren t incensed by it. For months, conservative commentators assured us that, when it comes to straight arrows, no arrow is straighter than FBI honcho James Comey   non-partisan, career public servant, will follow the evidence whereso er it leads; why,  no one in law enforcement  is  more capable of navigating through a political maelstrom  and any attempts to politicize the outcome will ensure that  Comey will resign in protest, and other high-level FBI officials could follow him out the door .All bollocks. Bollocks on stilts. Like everything else the Clintons touch, Comey s FBI is hopelessly corrupted   and certainly more corrupt than J Edgar Hoover s FBI, at least in the sense that Hoover was independent enough not to get rolled. The revelations of what happened reveal Comey to be a hack and a squish: he offered immunity to Hillary s aides not to facilitate his investigation but to obstruct any further investigation; he allowed witnesses to Hillary s crimes to serve as her  lawyers ; and he physically destroyed the evidence   that is, the laptops. A 6  8  gummi worm would be more of a straight arrow.Now come the latest revelations. Powerline s John Hinderaker writes:In the first page, an unidentified FBI employee says he was  pressured  to change the classification of an email to render it unclassified. This pressure came from someone within the FBI, who said he had been contacted by Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy, who  had asked his assistance in altering the email s classification in exchange for a  quid pro quo.'  The quid pro quo was that, if the FBI would say the email was unclassified, the State Department would allow the FBI to  place more Agents in countries where they are presently forbidden. So, to add to the corrupt revenue agency and the corrupt justice department, we now have a corrupt national law enforcement agency and a corrupt foreign ministry   willing, indeed, to subordinate national security and its own diplomatic policy to the personal needs of Hillary Clinton. Needless to say, if you get your news from ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, The Washington Post, The New York Times, etc, etc, you will be entirely unaware of all this. Which is the way they plan on operating for the next eight years.A small but telling point: Wikileaks  Julian Assange has lived in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for over four years. But not until he leaked against Hillary was his Internet cut off. Hillary, out of office, has a swifter and more ruthless global reach than Hillary in office on the night of Benghazi. And, should she win, her view of her subjects is that we should have the same information access as Ecuadorian Embassy refugees.John Hinderaker continues:We have here a clear pattern of corruption that makes Watergate look like child s play. Hillary s aide, Patrick Kennedy, tried to bribe the FBI to change the classification of a Benghazi document so as to enable Hillary s false claim that she didn t send or receive classified information on her illegal home server. The FBI, to its credit, refused. (James Comey wasn t involved at that stage.)Hillary s aide then asked whether the FBI would be saying anything publicly about the classification issue. Once assured that the FBI would be silent, Hillary took the stage and alleged publicly, and falsely, that she never used her illegal home server to send or receive classified information Donald Trump has his faults, but Hillary Clinton is far too corrupt to serve as President of the United States.On that last point, I agree wholeheartedly. In any society, the chief magistrate s first duty is to uphold the law, and throughout human history his easiest temptation, once in office, has been to regard himself as above it. In this case, the American people would be electing someone who, not yet in office, is already above the law, and way beyond it. (Even her bodily fluids are above the law.) That would be an extraordinary act, and Hillary and her cronies would be entirely justified in treating such an electorate with utter contempt.As for today s impotent and ineffectual Republican establishment, they ll look like rock-ribbed steel-spined titans compared to the husks that will remain after two Hillary terms.The corruption might not seem directly relevant to the rise of Donald Trump, but it s there, implicitly. The present arrangements work for the political class, the permanent bureaucracy, their client groups, and the lawless. But not for millions of the law-abiding. Consider illegal immigration, for example, which pre-Trump was entirely discussed in terms of the interests of the lawbreakers   how to  bring them out of the shadows , how to give them  a path to citizenship , celebrate their  family values  and  work ethic    and never in terms of the law-abiding, whose wages they depress, whose communities they transform, and, in too many criminal cases, whose lives they wreck.Victor Davis Hanson writes:Something has gone terribly wrong with the Republican party, and it has nothing to do with the flaws of Donald Trump. Something like his tone and message would have to be invented if he did not exist. None of the other 16 primary candidates   the great majority of whom had far greater political expertise, more even temperaments, and more knowledge of issues than did Trump   shared Trump s sense of outrage   or his ability to convey it   over what was wrong: The lives and concerns of the Republican establishment in the media and government no longer resembled those of half their supporters.That s exactly right. This time last year, to prevent Trump all you had to do was convey that same sense of outrage. As I wrote on July 10th 2015   a mere month after Trump entered the race:Trump, like other philosophically erratic politicians from Denmark to Greece, has tapped into a very basic strain of cultural conservatism: the question of how far First World peoples are willing to go in order to extinguish their futures on the altar of  diversity .As Ann Coulter s new book Adios, America! lays out in remorseless detail, Kate Steinle is dead because the entire Democratic Party, two-thirds of the Republican Party and 100 per cent of the diseased federal-state-municipal bureaucracy prioritizes myths over reality. Yes, it s distressing to persons of taste and discrimination that the only person willing to address that reality is Donald Trump. But that s because he s not the reality-show freak here. The fake-o lame-o reality freakshow is the political pseudo-campaign being waged within the restraints demanded by the media and Macy s. So, if Donald Trump is the only guy willing to bust beyond those bounds, we owe him a debt of gratitude. If, as Karl Rove proposes, other candidates are able to talk about the subject in a more  inclusive  way, so be it. But, if  inclusive  is code for not addressing it at all, nuts to that.I think we now know that  inclusive  is code for not addressing it at all, and that, if Trump loses next month, that s what the GOP establishment will go right back to doing.Will he lose? Given that he s running against both the Democrats and half the Republican Party, he remains tenaciously just about competitive. But Victor explains where the math comes up short:What has always been missing to end the long public career of Hillary Clinton is a four- or five-percentage-point boost from a m lange of the so-called Never Trump Republicans, as well as women and suburban, college-educated independents. Winning back some of these critics could translate into a one- or two-point lead over Clinton in critical swing states.Many of those openly supporting Hillary among the right-of-center pundit class are people I have known and worked with over the years   from Dorothy Rabinowitz to Max Boot to (he s considering it) Glenn Beck. I don t quite get this. As Victor puts it:In this low-bar presidential race, why do conservative establishmentarians and past foreign-policy officials feel a need to publish their support for the Democratic candidate, when their liberal counterparts feel no such urge to distance themselves from their own nominee? Is what Clinton actually did, in leaving Iraq abruptly, or lying about Benghazi, or violating federal security laws, so much less alarming than what Trump might do in shaking up NATO or  bombing the hell out of ISIS ?Just so. Trump is an unknown. But, to channel Donald Rumsfeld, Hillary is the most known known in the history of knowns. And what we know of her is that she s stinkingly corrupt, above the law, and able to suborn entire government agencies in the cause of her corruption. Where do you think we re gonna be after eight years of that?Oh, and it will be eight years. The NeverTrumpers are saying,  Don t worry. We ll get it right in 2020 , just like after 2012 they said,  Don t worry. We ll get it right in 2016 , and after 2008 they said,  Don t worry. We ll get it right in 2012.  Next time never comes. There are no tomorrows for the Republican Party, because, unlike the GOP, the Democrats use their victories very effectively.Victor Davis Hanson lives on a small family farm in rural California, at the sharp end of the artificial and lawless demographic transformation of a once Golden State. With respect to my former colleagues in the New York and Washington commentariat, I don t think they have any idea of how bleak life is in many parts of this country. And I don t mean Jimmy Carter-like  malaise    a brief blip after three decades of post-war prosperity   but bleakness as a permanent feature of life. Perhaps I m touchy about the corruption because I m a foreigner and I ve lived in countries with clean government. Perhaps I m sensitive to the contempt in which a put-upon middle-class is held because I ve spent much of the last year in wealthy first-world countries (France, Sweden, Germany) that are on the verge of implosion over their delusional immigration policies. But the indifference from influential conservatives to both the despair and the naked corruption is deeply disturbing.Think of what the last eight years have wrought   Obamacare, a weaponized IRS, six-figure fines for homophobic bakeries   and then pitch America forward to 2024. Picture the most absurd scenario you can concoct   say, a federal transgender-bathroom regime. Oh, no, wait, we ve already got that.The left is serious about power, and they don t waste time. The idea that the most personally corrupt candidate in modern American history will govern as some sort of benign moderate centrist placeholder until the wankers who thought Jeb Bush was a superstar shoo-in come up with their next inspiration is utterly preposterous.READ MORE FROM: STEYNONLINE",politics,"Oct 20, 2016",1
Trump signals willingness to raise U.S. minimum wage," (This version of the story corrects the figure for the current minimum wage to $7.25 from $15 in paragraph two) WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said on Wednesday he was “open to doing something” with the country’s minimum wage, but added that any increase would have to be weighed against a potential loss of competitiveness. “I’m open to doing something with it,” Trump said in an interview with CNN, adding that he did not like the current $7.25 an hour level. “I mean you have to something that you can live on.” “But what I really do like is bring our jobs back, so they’re making much more than the 15 dollars” an hour, he added.

SYRIAN MUSLIM IMMIGRANT HAIRDRESSER SLITS Female Employer’s Throat After Media Hailed Him As “Example Of Successful Integration”,"She wanted him to assimilate. She gave him a good job. She trusted him and offered the chance to prove he was willing to be a good employee. He slit her throat. There was nothing special or unique about Mohammad Hussain Rashwani, he was just another Muslim immigrant looking for a better life who had no interest in assimilating. Slitting his employer s throat is how Rashwani chose to show his gratitude for her trust in him.Mohammad Hussain Rashwani was hailed in the media as the  paramount example of successful integration  after he got a job as a hairdresser at a salon in Herzberg, Germany in late 2015.After a little over a year on the job, he decided to slit his female employer s throat.From Lausitzer Rundschau as translated by Gates of Vienna:  For me there weren t any signs that I could see Herzberg s hairdresser speaks about the knife attack by her Syrian employeeHerzberg s master hairdresser talks about what is motivating her these days since the attack by her Syrian employee two weeks ago.Should she have seen this attack against her coming? She keeps asking herself this question over and over. And she can t find an answer.  Even today, I do not know what I should think. Until that Wednesday evening, he was an endearing man. I believed up to the very last minute that something good could come of him because I appreciated his professional abilities very much,  Ilona F. says.The Herzberg woman doesn t want to talk about the attack itself; her thoughts are much more circling around  why  again and again.  Did I intervene too much? Was I too strong for him? Did we, my husband and I, organize too much for him?  These and other thoughts are constantly crossing her mind. But there weren t any signs that the Damascus-born Syrian maybe had other plans. His mother, which whom Ilona F. was in contact, had repeatedly written how grateful her son was for the chance that he received and how much he had respected the  she-boss .  He even assured my husband and me personally of this. Yet still, something had to have happened to him that made him commit this terrible bloody deed.  For me, there were no signs that something like this could happen,  the 64-year-old says, looking back. But, she admits, he had changed considerably in the past few months. Ilona F. explains:  We had invested a lot of time in him after our spectacular beginnings, and we had helped him in every way possible. We had plans. He is an outstanding hairdresser. The customers were super-happy with his work. Until the very last minute I had believed that things were going to work. Here s where the story that is all too typical of Muslim immigrants starts to take shape:Even then changes started to set in. He, a Muslim who until now did not seem in any way a devout believer, had began to talk about Allah more and more. This certainly got on her nerves for over time. He also quit visiting the hairdresser and her husband at home. Before the changes he came by almost every day. They had talked about everything, professional and private. But he had begun to neglect his study of the German language more and more.  He kept assuring me that he wanted to learn the language, but later. More and more he said later this, later that, when we talked about his future,  the businesswoman recounts.And then there were also problems in the salon. Mohammad H. came to work too late more often; he didn t take time very seriously. He became very reluctant to drive to work at Sch newalde, where his boss owned a second hair salon. And during the week the attack took place, he outright refused to go.After a disagreement in the Herzberg salon, when a customer was unhappy with the work of the Syrian hairdresser, she had given him notice that they had to talk.  I knew it couldn t go on like this. But immediately the question arose in my mind, what would become of him if I were to throw him out. After all, I still believed in him. That this by now was a fatal mistake is something the Herzberg woman is only slowly beginning to realize.  That I could have been so wrong in my judgment of another person,  she shakes her head.  Actually, I feel really sorry for him.   Information Liberation ",left-news,"Jul 17, 2017",1
HE’S BAAACK! KHIZR KAHN TO APPEAR WITH RADICAL ANTI-ISRAEL/PRO-MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD ACTIVIST…Nothing To see Here…,"Remember the Muslim couple that appeared at the DNC as a Gold Star Family? Remember how they bashed Donald Trump for wanting to keep our Nation safe from terrorists? Yes, now that father is going to Michigan to appear with a radical anti-Israel/pro-Muslim Brotherhood activist. Does anyone out there want to guess that this same man who ranted at Trump has had connections to radical Muslim groups BUT our main stream media chose NOT to do their job in telling the truth. Our press is complicit in its desire to lie to Americans to further the liberal agenda which REALLY IS criminal. Luckily you have the new media that will dig like hell to tell you the truth. Thanks to Brandon Hall of our local West Michigan Politics for exposing a visit by Huma Abedin and now Dr. Kahn. Bravo!Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier killed in Iraq and well known for his feud with Donald Trump, will appear at an event in Dearborn in a few weeks with Amr Moussa, an Egyptian leader whose rise can be traced to his immense hatred of Israel.Moussa has refused to visit the Holocaust Museum, said Hamas was not a terrorist group, said Egypt shouldn t respond to the 9/11 attacks if Israel was a part of the coalition, and is sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood.The event takes place on September 29th at the Ford Community and Performing Arts Center in Dearborn.According to the New Republic, well known as a liberal publication, Moussa is an  anti-Israel demagogue. They write that  Moussa owes his startling political ascendance primarily to one thing: his shameless exploitation of anti-Israel demagoguery for political gain. Moussa, long hostile to America and Israel, even refused to visit the Holocaust Memorial. He was forced to backtrack after extreme pressure from the global community. As Egypt s top diplomat, Moussa immediately projected an adversarial approach toward the United States and Israel. One of the first issues he handled was the Madrid Peace Conference, which the George H.W. Bush administration hoped would help shape a new regional order following the Persian Gulf War. When Israel insisted that the administration push for the repeal of a U.N. General Assembly Resolution that equated Zionism with racism as a precondition for joining the peace conference, Moussa demanded that the issue be tabled until after the conference, and Egypt was ultimately absent from the vote. Later, when Israel pursued improved ties with Arab states following the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, Moussa argued that full Arab normalization should occur only after the final exchange of territory.Read more: WMP",politics,"Aug 29, 2016",1
 Cher Goes On Yet Another GLORIOUS Twitter Tirade About Flint’s Poisoned Water (TWEETS),"Cher has certainly used her power, money, and influence to help the people who are suffering from their water being poisoned by Michigan s Republican Governor Rick Snyder. She has already gifted water to the residents of Flint, and now she is using her influence on social media to remind the whole world just what a travesty the whole situation is.First, the superstar singer-turned-activist reminded everyone of her own humble beginnings. You see, Cher wasn t always rich and famous. She was, in fact, quite poor, as she reveals in one tweet. However, she also says that no matter how destitute they were, her mother was never afraid to let her drink or bathe in the water flowing from their taps:I remember my mom crying because she couldn't make ends meet,I was sick & she couldn't afford Dr  BUT..SHE WAS NEVER AFRAID OF OUR WATER  Cher (@cher) January 23, 2016She also posted picture of the water that the residents of Flint  had been assured was  safe  until this scandal broke, and they are nothing short of absolutely horrifying. It looks more like mud than water, and is clearly unsafe. However, considering that Flint s residents are mostly destitute African Americans, we can be assured that their situation didn t matter to the right, white GOP governor Rick Snyder and his emergency management people who made this nightmare a reality.How would U like 2 wake up Tomm & have nothing but  water 2 give your kids 2 DRINK,BATHE IN WASH CLOTHES IN pic.twitter.com/lxhkhSAB72  Cher (@cher) January 23, 2016Cher then tweeted a photo of the water running into a washing machine to wash a family s clothing. It is nothing short of deadly, and that is why people are dying and children who have been drinking and bathing in that water have elevated lead levels in their young bloodstreams, which will likely affect them for the rest of their lives.Cher, Flint s own native son Michael Moore, and many other people in positions of power and influence are just as outraged by this as the rest of us. Luckily, they have the money, power, know-how, and resources to actually do something about it. And they are.Hopefully, the next step will be to get this disgusting excuse for a human being and a governor, Rick Snyder, out of office, and into the dustbins of history with other rightfully disgraced politicians.Featured image via Cher Twitter",News,"January 23, 2016",1
Trump names Cruz ally Mike Lee as possible Supreme Court justice,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump on Friday named U.S. Senator Mike Lee as a potential Supreme Court nominee, turning to an ally of former rival Ted Cruz in an apparent gesture to conservative Republicans who have been wary of the Republican presidential candidate.  Lee was included on a new list of 21 potential Supreme Court justices that Trump would consider for the high court if he is elected over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election. “This list is definitive and I will choose only from it in picking future justices of the United States Supreme Court,” Trump said in a statement. The announcement came out on a day in which neither candidate had a public event and were preparing for Monday’s first presidential debate. The list Trump announced included 10 new names and 11 conservative jurists from a list the New York businessman had announced in May. Lee’s brother, Thomas Lee, an associate justice of the Utah Supreme Court, was on the initial list and remains on Trump’s expanded list. Trump’s listing of Mike Lee amounted to a gesture to U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas, a conservative who fought Trump fiercely as a rival for the Republican presidential nomination and who has refused to endorse Trump. Trump’s bombastic style and proposals breaking with some conservative orthodoxies such as support for free trade agreements have sparked unease among traditional conservative Republicans.  Mike Lee, in a statement, said he appreciated being considered. “Right now I’m focused on my job in the Senate, where I’m in a good position to defend the Constitution by fighting against government overreach. Both lists that I’ve seen from the Trump campaign are fantastic.  “While my brother and I might disagree as to which list is better, they’re both great,” he quipped. The death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia on Feb. 13 left the court with a four-to-four tie between right-leaning and left-leaning justices. Democratic President Barack Obama has nominated Merrick Garland, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, but the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate has refused to consider confirming him. Trump said his list was based on who would follow constitutional principles on the high court. The possibility of Republicans ceding control of the court to the Democrats has been one of his main rallying cries at campaign events. Others on Trump’s list include Keith Blackwell, a justice on the Supreme Court of Georgia; Charles Canady, a Florida Supreme Court justice; Neil Gorsuch, a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, and Edward Mansfield, an Iowa Supreme Court justice. Other names included Federico Moreno, a judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida; Margaret Ryan, a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces; Amul Thapar, a judge of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky; Timothy Tymkovich, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit; and Robert Young, chief justice of the Supreme Court of Michigan.

 Trump Reveals The ONE THING To Stop Him From Debating Hillary And It’s RIDICULOUS (VIDEO),"On Monday, Donald Trump gave interviews to reporters on his plane, and naturally the subject of the presidential debates against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton came up. As expected, Trump s responses were nothing short of moronic and unbelievable, and show just how unprepared Trump is to be president.As reporters threw different questions at Trump about his strategy to beat Clinton, Trump gave responses that should have his supporters worried sick about how he s going to win. Trump told reporters that he is barely doing any debate prep   in stark contrast to most presidential candidates. With a dismissive attitude, the ignorant business mogul revealed that he has not planned on mock debates, saying he d pretty much rather wing it: I ve seen people do so much prep work when they get out there, they can t speak. I ve seen that. Then when Trump was asked if he d actually follow through with the debates, Trump gave an even more surprising answer.Trump said,  As of this moment, yeah    a strange response for sure. And then he said that only hurricanes and natural disasters  would stop him from debating the former Secretary of State. He said: I expect to do all three. I look forward to the debates. You can watch this bizarre interview below:Hilariously, Trump also said that it was his  obligation  to debate Clinton and that presidential debates are an  important element of what we re doing.  He said: I did them with the other, you know, the other cases. We had, I guess 11 debates. Obviously, I did well in the debates. Obviously, according to the polls, the online polls they did right after the debates. And I think I m doing the same thing. Trump must have forgotten that he actually skipped one of the GOP debates, and also backed out of the debate that he challenged Vermont senator Bernie Sanders to. And there are ongoing rumors that Trump is going to somehow find an excuse to back out of his debates with Clinton as well. Judging from this interview alone, we would not be surprised.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"September 5, 2016",1
Small Canadian designer in spotlight as Meghan Markle dons its coat,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian designer Line the Label shot to prominence on Monday after U.S. actress Meghan Markle wore a coat from the brand in her first public appearance after her engagement to Britain s Prince Harry.  Markle appeared in the sunken garden at Kensington Palace on Monday in the late November chill, donning the C$799 ($627.11) white wrap coat with oversized collars and cinched at the waist with a knotted belt. The surge in interest in the coat caused the style to quickly sell out and crashed the Toronto-based knitwear label s website in some parts of the world, including in London.  The company is taking reorders on the coat, an external spokeswoman said by email.  Line has since named the coat  Meghan,  company President and co-founder John Muscat said in a statement, adding it was one of her favorite pieces from the fashion label.   We are incredibly honored that Meghan chose to wear a Line coat to mark this very special occasion,  Muscat said.  We are elated for Meghan and wish her a lifetime of happiness with Prince Harry.  Markle, who has a starring role in the Toronto-filmed U.S. TV show  Suits,  has lived in the Canadian city for several years. Markle also wore a Line coat to the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games in Toronto in September, days after the pair made their first public appearance together.  Celebrities including Sandra Bullock, Jennifer Garner and Kate Hudson have also been photographed wearing the brand.  Line was founded in 2000 by Muscat and designer Jennifer Wells. It was acquired a few years later by Canadian fashion house and importer PYA, which is based in a north Toronto suburb. ",worldnews,"November 27, 2017 ",0
 Bill O’Reilly Says Our Economy Will IMPLODE If We Don’t Keep Pushing Poverty,"When Bill O Reilly calls himself a journalist, he shows he has no idea what that word actually means because he seems to be wholly unable to fact-check anything. On The O Reilly Factor Wednesday night, he went after Democrats and the economy the same way Republicans love to, by attacking the idea of helping low-wage workers as something that will destroy absolutely everyone.Basically, he believes that if we want people to live comfortably on only 40 hours of work per week, we ll have to raise wages so high that we ll cause the U.S. economy to collapse. In fact, he seems to think that reducing poverty by raising the minimum wage is a radical left-wing, fringe idea that will ruin our economy if we actually go ahead and implement it.In short, he says it s a horrible idea because he has no idea how our economy works.The funny thing is that he used to trumpet a higher minimum wage   at least, he used to support a $10/hr minimum wage.

Burundi will raise funds from citizens to pay for 2020 election,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Burundi plans to raise money for an election in 2020 by deducting part of civil servants  salaries and taking contributions directly from citizens, a government minister said on Monday, as it seeks to replace dwindling external funding. Until 2015, Burundi used external aid to pay for elections, but donors have suspended their assistance since a political crisis erupted when President Pierre Nkurunziza sought and won a third term. Pascal Barandagiye, the minister for interior, said the government will also be seek contributions from every household, which will pay up to 2000 francs ($1.14) a year. Gross national income per capita stood at $280 in 2016, and close to 65 percent of the population live below the poverty line, according to World Bank data.  The total amount of the election cost is not yet known ... But as soon as the needed fund is got the fundraising campaign will be halted,  Barandagiye told a news conference.  That contribution should be given voluntarily, it shouldn t be seen as a head tax.  Students of voting age will contribute 1000 francs annually. Civil servants will contribute at least a tenth of their monthly salaries, Barandagiye said. Foreign help would also be accepted, he said.  Burundi has been gripped by a political crisis since April 2015, when Nkurunziza announced he would stand for a third term, which the opposition said violated the constitution as well as a 2005 peace deal that ended a 12-year civil war. He won a vote largely boycotted by the opposition, but protests sparked a government crackdown. More than 700 people have been killed and 400,000 displaced to neighbouring countries. The economy has stagnated. The aid-dependent nation now has to rely on domestic tax collection and modest revenue from coffee and tea exports. Key donors, such as the European Union, cut direct financial support to the government over accusations of human rights violations and the crackdown on opponents, which Burundi rejects. At the end of October, Burundi s cabinet adopted draft legislation seeking to change the current constitution to allow Nkurunziza to run for a fourth term in the 2020 election. The proposed amendments, which are likely to go to a referendum by next year, seek to abolish the two-term limit and lengthen the presidential terms to seven years.

No-confidence vote against Pennsylvania approved amid corruption probe,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (Reuters) - The city council of Allentown, Pennsylvania, voted unanimously on Wednesday to approve a resolution expressing “no confidence” in Mayor Ed Pawlowski and urging him to resign as an FBI corruption investigation swirls around city hall. The move followed guilty pleas by three members of Pawlowski’s administration to federal charges stemming from what prosecutors say was a pay-to-play scheme benefiting the mayor, who has held the top job in Pennsylvania’s third-largest city for 10 years. However, the vote by all seven members of the Allentown City Council is non-binding, meaning that they cannot force Pawlowski from office. “No, he doesn’t have to resign,” City Councilman Julio Guridy said before the meeting. “He can stay there until they arrest him.” Pawlowski did not attend the meeting but a spokesman has previously said he did not intend to resign.  “It is disappointing that the City Council has chosen to be politically opportunistic rather than do the job they have been elected to do,” Pawlowski’s attorney, Mark Schamel, said in a statement issued after the vote. “The mayor has not been charged with anything. It is a political stunt.” Schamel said Pawlowski remained committed to serving the city as mayor and urged the public to be patient with the judicial process. Removing an elected official in Pennsylvania is relatively difficult unless that official is convicted of a serious crime. Only the state legislature can remove a mayor through impeachment. Allentown residents spoke on both sides of the issue. “Crime is down everywhere in Allentown except in one place, city hall, where we are,” businessman Chris Cocca said, calling the resolution “the right thing to do.” Antiques dealer Paul Fuhrman said the council was making a mistake: “This is some kind of vendetta.” Dale Wiles, a former assistant city solicitor, pleaded guilty in December to withholding documents from the FBI. Gary Strathearn, the former finance director, and Mary Ellen Koval, the former city controller, pleaded guilty this month to fraud charges. All three are awaiting sentencing. Court papers identify the purported master of the scheme as “Public Official #3.” The city council resolution says Pawlowski is the only city official who fits the description. Pawlowski needed campaign funds in 2014 for an abortive run for governor, and in 2015 for an announced bid for the U.S. Senate that ended when the FBI raided city hall on July 2, 2015.

"In Trump strongholds, Democrats walk tightrope ahead of 2018 elections","KATY, Texas (Reuters) - As Democrats try to win control of the U.S. Congress in next year’s midterm elections, their hopes of picking up a Senate seat in Republican-dominated Texas rest with a telegenic ex-punk rocker who wants to impeach President Donald Trump and legalize marijuana. Beto O’Rourke’s long-shot bid to unseat incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz illustrates the tightrope Democrats must walk as they gear up for the November 2018 elections. Democrats will have to win in areas that backed Trump last year in order to gain control of the House of Representatives and the Senate but even in Texas the party’s left-wing base is pressing candidates to stop the president by any means necessary. O’Rourke, who currently represents El Paso in the House, is drawing big crowds across Texas as he calls for universal healthcare and new restrictions on gun ownership. At a recent rally outside Houston, hundreds of supporters stood in line for up to an hour to shake his hand. O’Rourke, 45, said Trump’s surprise victory last year was a big reason he decided to run for the Senate. He said Trump’s racially charged rhetoric and divisive governing style have led him to support impeachment. “I’m now convinced beyond the shadow of a doubt that Donald Trump is unfit for that office,” O’Rourke told Reuters in an interview. “This is a moment unlike any other, certainly in my lifetime, I think in this country since the Civil War, where we have to really decide who we are, and there are two very clear paths that we can take,” he said. The end of the path laid out by Trump “is tyranny, it is not democracy,” O’Rourke said. O’Rourke’s unapologetic progressivism stands out among Democrats who are campaigning outside the party’s liberal strongholds in the Northeast and on West Coast. In deeply conservative Alabama, Democratic Senate candidate Doug Jones has been running as a pragmatist ahead of a Dec. 12 special election, saying he wants to be a “voice for reason” in Washington. He has run ads attacking Republican opponent Roy Moore over a sex scandal, but has steered clear of harsh anti-Trump rhetoric.  In Virginia, Ralph Northam denounced Trump as a “narcissistic maniac” as he sought the Democratic nomination for governor, but dialed back the rhetoric during the general election, telling voters ahead of his Nov. 7 victory that he would work with Trump when it was in his state’s interest. In Congress, a handful of rank-and-file House Democrats have filed articles of impeachment even though U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is still investigating whether Trump’s campaign worked with Russia in last year’s election. Russia has repeatedly denied meddling and Trump has called the investigation a “witch hunt.” Democratic House Leader Nancy Pelosi said earlier this month that she would not make impeachment a priority if her party won the House next year but Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer has said it is premature to consider impeachment. Even some of O’Rourke’s supporters say impeachment talk is counterproductive as long as Republicans control Congress. “Otherwise, in my view, it’s just chest-beating,” said Nikki Redpath, a Houston-area homemaker and O’Rourke campaign volunteer. O’Rourke is seen as the favorite to win the Democratic nomination in March but analysts say his progressive views could prove a liability as he tries to reverse his party’s long losing streak in the Lone Star State. Trump finished nine percentage points ahead of Democrat Hillary Clinton in Texas last year and the state has not elected a Democratic governor or senator since 1994. Democrats have lost recent statewide elections by double-digit margins and have struggled to recruit top-tier candidates for major races. Still, O’Rourke’s anti-Trump message has resonated with oil-industry executive Katherine Stovring, who said she used to vote for candidates from both parties but now has been motivated to work for Democratic candidates as a way to stop Trump.  “I’m looking for ways to engage. This is our democracy at risk,” she said. Texas Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak said he thought O’Rourke would be trounced by Cruz unless voters turn en masse against Trump nationally. “He’s a more interesting candidate than the traditional sacrificial lamb the Democrats put up,” Mackowiak said. “But he’s far too liberal to be elected statewide.” In an era where differences between Republicans and Democrats are stark, candidates like O’Rourke have little incentive to moderate their positions, said James Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas. At this point there is little downside for O’Rourke to make polarizing statements on impeachment and other issues.     “I think you can expect to hear a lot more of that as the campaign unfolds,” he said.

Van Niekerk forced to work his way to tantalizing 400m final,"LONDON (Reuters) - Wayde van Niekerk duly qualified for the World Championship 400 meters final on Sunday but the defending champion and world record holder looks to have a real battle on his hands after some searing semi-final performances. The South African was desperately trying to conserve energy as he bids for a 200/400m double but was forced to go deeper than he would have liked by Botswana’s Baboloki Thebe in the second of three semi-finals, eventually clocking 44.22 seconds. By that stage two 21-year-olds had fired out a warning with massive personal bests. Steven Gardiner improved his own Bahamas national record and went under 44 seconds for the first time, clocking a 43.89 which he might pay for in the final on Tuesday. Nathon Allen also set a Jamaican record, taking almost half a second off his best with 44.19. Botswana’s Isaac Makwala looked very comfortable in winning his heat in 44.22 seconds. Van Niekerk was originally drawn in the opening heat but organizers changed the lineup, which pleased the South African. “Whoever changed it, thank you, I wasn’t ready for 43 seconds,” he said. “It seems like every time we go on the track someone breaks 44 seconds. It is good competition but it just means I always have to be on my game. “I’m just trying to get through the rounds as conservatively as I can.”  American’s big hope Fred Kerley scraped into the final as a fast loser but former Olympic and world champion LaShawn Merritt, another man to serve a doping ban though unlike compatriot Justin Gatlin loudly cheered by the London crowd,  failed to make it.

" Trump Embarrasses U.S., Brags About Election Win In Joint Press Conference With Trudeau (VIDEO)","Amateur president Donald Trump met with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday to speak in a joint press conference, and he thoroughly embarrassed the U.S. again by feeding his ego in front of the entire world. The topic of Syrian refugees was brought up by a reporter, and of course, Trump had to bring up his election victory. President Trump, you seemed to suggest that Syrian refugees are a Trojan horse for potential terrorism, while the prime minister hugs refugees and welcomes them with open arms,  a reporter asked.  Are you confident the northern border is secure? You can never be totally confident,  Trump replied. Trump heaped praise on Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly for doing a  great job  of deporting  very, very hardened criminals  so far, as reported by Talking Points Memo. That s what I said I would do. I m just doing what I said I would do, and we won by a very, very large electoral college vote,  Trump said.Trump went on to say that he  knew  he would win the election. That s an odd statement to make since he admitted to being surprised that he won after the election during his thank you tour following the election. I knew this is what people were wanting. That wasn t the only reason, that wasn t my only thing that we did so well on, but that was something that was very important,  Trump said.  I think that in the end, everyone is going to be extremely happy. And I will tell you right now, a lot of people are very, very happy right now. Watch:A lot of people are not  very happy right now  as Trump suggested. His approval rating is tanking like the Titanic. Before taking the oath of office, Trump s approval rating as president-elect was the worst in modern history, and it s gotten even worse since Inauguration Day. Trump s disapproval rating has risen 5 percentage points since just last week. Since his  election,  Trump has witnessed mass protests across the country. The Women s March on Washington, which took place the day after he was sworn in, garnered a far larger crowd than his inauguration. Nope, people are not  happy right now,  but he knows that. That s why he repeatedly brings up his election victory and most times, tries to claim he won the popular vote by saying that 3 million people voted illegally in the U.S. election. That s nearly the same number by which Hillary Clinton won the popular vote.Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images.",News,"February 13, 2017",1

Help wanted: Staff shortages under Trump slow policy changes,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hundreds of government employees file in and out of the U.S. agency for auto safety in Washington every working day, investigating potentially dangerous vehicles and managing a $900 million annual budget. But an administrator is not among them - nobody has been nominated to the top job since President Donald Trump took office.  Also missing from the roughly 550 people on the payroll of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, are a permanent chief counsel, director for government affairs, chief financial officer and enforcement chief. While a deputy administrator was appointed last week, slow progress in bringing in senior politically appointed officials has nearly frozen key decision-making at the agency, according to five former NHTSA officials, consumer groups, lawmakers and some business leaders. They said that without leadership in place NHTSA has either pushed back or failed to act on rules setting new standards for improving how buses fare in rollover crashes, a system to remind passengers in rear seats to wear seat belts, and new tire standards. Eight months into Trump’s presidency, senior positions in many government agencies across Washington remain vacant, including roles at the State Department, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency and throughout the Transportation Department that oversees NHTSA.  Some of the vacancies are the result of Trump’s efforts to slim down the federal bureaucracy. Others are simply waiting to be filled.  The White House blames Democrats for dragging out the confirmation process for its nominees, and says vetting picks has been more complicated than usual because many come from the business world rather than government. While many companies applaud Trump’s moves to roll back federal bureaucracy, some also complain that delays in bringing aboard political appointees is hindering government decisions that could impact business.  The frustration extends to some U.S. diplomats, private-sector lawyers and others who regularly deal with government agencies, according to interviews. In September, the U.S. Tire Manufacturers Association urged Trump in a letter to accelerate his efforts to nominate a NHTSA administrator so the agency can comply with a 2015 road safety law passed by Congress.     The law ordered NHTSA to write regulations setting minimum tire standards for fuel efficiency and traction in wet conditions and create an online database for consumers to check for tire recalls. U.S. manufacturers and consumer groups support the regulations, drawn up in response to vehicle deaths linked to faulty tires, because they will raise standards and make the U.S. market less accessible to poorly made versions. “We don’t want the U.S. to be kind of the dumping group for the really low technology because there isn’t a standard to meet,” said Dan Zielinski, the association’s senior vice president.  Two former NHTSA leaders and consumer groups say the agency is also moving slowly on other regulatory issues, such as improving side impact standards. “This agency is in a stall ... They are not going to do very much without political leadership,” said Joan Claybrook, a former NHTSA administrator under President Jimmy Carter and a prominent consumer advocate. NHTSA said in a statement Friday that safety is its top priority. The agency is “committed to meeting all obligations as required” by the 2015 law. NHTSA has an ongoing review of all regulatory actions as part of an administration-wide effort. A White House spokeswoman declined to comment on NHTSA but said “capable and professional staff” are filling essential positions throughout the government on an acting basis until confirmations go through. Leadership shortages extend beyond the NHTSA. The White House had by Oct. 4 nominated 387 political appointees for civilian positions in the executive branch and 160 have been confirmed by the U.S. Senate, according to the non-partisan Partnership for Public Service. Both numbers were well below those in the first eight months under at least the last four presidents. In the same period of Barack Obama’s presidency, 497 candidates were nominated and 337 confirmed. One senior administration official said it aims to have all top positions - those at the level of assistant secretary and above - nominated by year’s end. Still, some political appointee jobs are expected to stay empty, the White House spokeswoman said. “The federal government has grown unrestrained for decades because politicians have been too afraid to ‘drain the swamp’,” she said. Follow Trump's impact on energy, environment, healthcare, immigration and the economy at The Trump Effect www.reuters.com/trump-effect In many cases, dire warnings from opponents that Trump’s delays in putting forward political nominations for approval would cause chaos have proven overblown.       But there are examples of government slowing down because mid-level employees do not have the authority or are unwilling to make decisions.     At the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which analyzes proposed transactions to ensure they do not harm national security, private-sector lawyers complain of slow decisions on big deals.     “There is an unwillingness for the staff people to make a decision,” said Michael Gershberg, a trade and investment attorney with Fried Frank.  A lobbyist who works on CFIUS deals said some companies have had to refile proposals because CFIUS failed to reach a decision within 75 days. That drives up legal and financing fees and creates uncertainty about the deal.        Deals that have been refiled include a bid by Jack Ma’s Ant Financial to buy MoneyGram (MGI.O) and Zhongwang USA’s $2.33 billion bid for Aleris Corp (ALSD.PK). The Senate last week confirmed Heath Tarbert, who is expected to oversee CFIUS, as an assistant secretary of the Treasury. At the State Department, only six of the top 40 jobs have been filled, and no confirmed officials are in place to run regional bureaus that handle foreign relations. Instead, they are in the hands of career diplomats with limited authority.     The United States does not have an ambassador in place in such key allied countries as South Korea, Jordan, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.      “We’re pretty much frozen in amber here,” one official said.     A congressional aide said it was hard to determine the precise impact of the vacancies. But he added that U.S. policy in the North Korea missiles crisis would likely be helped by an ambassador in Seoul, a fully empowered assistant secretary of state for East Asia and an active special envoy for North Korea.      “That’s just one example in the region with the most prominent national security crisis, and really one of the most serious in a long time,” he said.     Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, testifying in Congress on Sept. 26, addressed the slow pace of filling posts.     “We’re behind the curve. We should be ahead of the curve. And we’re doing all we can to catch up,” he said. “Our work is getting done. It would be better done if we had those positions filled.”     ",politicsNews,"October 6, 2017 ",0
"U.S. may soon expand U.N. talks on North Korea sanctions, signaling China deal: diplomats","UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States could shortly broaden talks on a push for stronger U.N. sanctions on North Korea to include all 15 Security Council members, signaling a likely deal with China on new measures, diplomats said on Thursday. Since North Korea’s July 4 launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the United States has been negotiating with Pyongyang ally China on a draft resolution to impose new sanctions on North Korea, which fired a second ICBM last Friday, in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. “We have been working very hard for some time and we certainly hope that this is going to be a consensus resolution,” China’s U.N. Ambassador Liu Jieyi told Reuters on Thursday. Some diplomats said the United States could give the draft resolution to all 15 council members as early as Thursday. Typically, the United States and China have agreed sanctions on North Korea before formally involving other council members. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, China, Russia, France or Britain to be adopted. The United States has been informally keeping Britain and France in the loop on the negotiations, while U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said China had been sharing the draft and negotiating with Russia. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has been frustrated that China has not done more to rein in North Korea and Washington has threatened to impose new sanctions on Chinese firms doing business with Pyongyang. But Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his British counterpart, Boris Johnson, on Friday that China would continue to fully and strictly implement Security Council resolutions on North Korea, the ministry said.  Haley said on Sunday the United States was “done talking about North Korea” and China must decide if it is willing to back imposing stronger U.N. sanctions. But she has also acknowledged that Russia’s engagement on the draft resolution would be the “true test.” Russia noted on Thursday that the permanent five (P5) veto powers had yet to formally discuss the draft. It was not immediately clear if poor relations between Russia and the United States, which imposed new unilateral sanctions on Russia on Wednesday, would hamper the negotiations. “Even if there is an agreement between the U.S. and China, it doesn’t mean there is an agreement between the P5 members,” said Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, who met with Liu earlier on Thursday and discussed a possible resolution. “Maybe there is a bilateral agreement (between Beijing and Washington), but that’s not a universal one,” he said, adding that while he was aware of what might be in the resolution he had not seen “the draft as it stands now.”  The U.S. mission to the United Nations declined to comment. Moscow has disagreed with assessments by Western powers that Pyongyang has launched two long-range missiles, saying they were mid-range. Diplomats say China and Russia only view a test of a long-range missile or a nuclear weapon as a trigger for further possible U.N. sanctions. North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs and the Security Council has ratcheted up the measures in response to five nuclear weapons tests and two long-range missile launches.

Exclusive: Pyongyang university to start fall classes without American staff after travel ban,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST), North Korea s only western-funded university, will start the fall semester without its dozens of American staff after failing to secure exemptions to a U.S. travel ban that starts on Friday.  PUST - home to the largest concentration of foreigners in the reclusive state - plans to revise courses and teaching schedules but its largely English-based curriculum will be heavily impacted, two sources familiar with PUST s operations said. PUST was founded in 2010 by a Korean American evangelical Christian with the goal of helping North Korea's future elite learn the skills to modernize the isolated country and engage with the outside world. (Graphic: Americans detained in North Korea - tmsnrt.rs/2pmE3ks) In mid-July, however, the U.S. State Department announced a ban on Americans traveling to North Korea following the death earlier this year of an American student who had been detained by the state while on a tour. It advised U.S. citizens living there to leave. Since then, tensions on the Korean peninsula have escalated significantly. Nuclear-armed North Korea has undertaken a number of provocative missile tests, including two intercontinental ballistic missile launches and one medium-range missile test this week that flew over Japan. Of the roughly 130 foreigners at PUST including faculty members, staffers and family members, about 60 were U.S. citizens, one of the sources said, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation. None had received special permission to stay and all have now left Pyongyang.  The teaching activities and the unique  international English-based  character of the school are severely impacted by the U.S. travel ban and the decision of some other personnel not to return,  the source said.  The school, which is open about its Christian affiliation, has already been rocked by the detention of two of its staff members by the North Korean regime this year. The two were accused of acting against the interests of the state. U.S. officials announced the ban six weeks ago due to the risk Americans will be held for  long-term detention  in the country. The ban was imposed after U.S. student Otto Warmbier was sentenced to 15 years hard labor for allegedly trying to steal a propaganda poster while on a tour last year.  Warmbier fell into a coma in custody and died soon after he was released to U.S. officials. The circumstances surrounding his death are not clear. The last major tour involving U.S. tourists flew out of North Korea on Thursday. The ban, similar to previous U.S. restrictions on travel to Iraq and Libya, makes North Korea the only country in the world Americans are currently banned by the State Department from visiting. Journalists and humanitarian workers can apply for special permission. But the U.S. government has yet to issue guidelines on how to obtain waivers, leaving PUST and educators uncertain how or when it might be possible to apply for exemptions, according to the people familiar with PUST s operations. The State Department said it was unable to comment on specific requests for exemptions.  Over the past several weeks, PUST leaders have tried to lobby for exemptions so that their work can continue, the sources said. The school is involved in ongoing discussions with U.S. officials, they added. The university was seen as a rare experiment in academic diplomacy with a country increasingly entirely isolated from the rest of the world due to tightening sanctions over its defiant pursuit of nuclear weapons programs. U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to stop Pyongyang achieving its goal of being able to fire a nuclear warhead to the United States and has warned the U.S. military is  locked and loaded  in case of North Korean provocation. Since PUST took in its first 50 students in 2010, the school has grown to about 500 undergraduate and 60 graduate students studying in mostly three departments - electronic and computer engineering, international finance and management and agriculture and life sciences.   A lot of effort has been spent over the past seven years that PUST has been operating. The prospect of this progress being undermined - even totally thwarted - as a consequence of the U.S. government action, is deeply worrying to everyone involved,  one of the sources said.

" Exclusive: Interview With Progressive Superstar Running For Congress, Zephyr Teachout","Before Senator Bernie Sanders popularized stepping up to the Democratic establishment, which has been overrun by corporate and big money influences, Zephyr Teachout made waves in New York State by challenging Democratic incumbent, Governor Andrew Cuomo, to a primary race in 2014. Despite being heavily out funded by Governor Cuomo, who received millions of dollars in campaign contributions from corporations and wealthy interests, Ms. Teachout received 34 percent of the vote, including winning many counties in the state, including Albany County, home of the state s capital. Although she lost, her campaign, the first she ever ran, was a blow to the myth that elected officials, particularly incumbents, are invincible in elections from their own political party.In January 2016, Ms. Teachout, currently as Associate Law Professor at Fordham University, announced she is running for New York s 19th Congressional District seat. I m running to raise up the voice that people have been shut out of politics. I think you can see across the political spectrum people are really frustrated by congress, and by politics that are increasingly driven by big money,  said Ms. Teachout in a phone interview.Ms. Teachout cited as one of the broad issues she plans to tackle in congress, is campaign finance reform, especially in regards to overturning the SCOTUS Citizens United ruling in 2010. I ve already been working in the last several years to promote Congressman John Sarbanes  (D-MD) bill, which is basically modeled off of the public financing system in New York City,  she said.  Congress unfortunately is trapped by congress members having to spend 50 percent of their time raising money. A public financing system like what Congressman Sarbanes has proposed, The Government by The People Act, would allow congress members to raise money from small donors and still have enough to reach all the voters. I think shutting down the revolving door between lobbyists and government is essential. In tandem to the issue of campaign financing being overhauled by corporations, the Trans-Pacific Partnership has received a lot of criticism from Republicans, Independents, and Democrats, including Ms. Teachout, for heavily favoring corporations and handing to them unprecedented leverage over governments. The TPP is a continuation of NAFTA ad even worse than NAFTA,  said Ms. Teachout.  Instead of changing direction and building towards a 21st century trade policy, the TPP doubles down on failed trade policy. Negotiations over Trans-Pacific Partnership between the United States and 11 other countries began during the Bush administration, and has been pushed by the Obama administration. Both Democratic Presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders have opposed the agreement, while Republican Presidential Candidates have expressed mixed feelings over it, with Donald Trump and Ted Cruz against it, but Governor Kasich in favor. Ms. Teachout added: I m actually quite hopeful we are going to stop it. I think a year ago you would have said  the big guns have this locked down , but there has been a truly extraordinary swelling of grassroots energy from Republicans, Democrats, and Independents all across the board against it. People are saying this is the wrong direction, we actually want more made in America, we want to buy locally owned goods and we want to be making law through a democratic process. One of the real problems of the TPP for me is it shuts you out of the process, and that is fundamental. Instead of making policy through congress which has its own problems, its making policy in the backroom, and that s no way to make international or basic economic policy in our country. New York s 19th Congressional District includes Sullivan, Ulster, Delaware, Otsego, Schoharie, Greene and Columbia Counties and parts of Montgomery, Rensselaer and Dutchess Counties. Current Representative of the district, Republican Chris Gibson announced he is retiring, leaving the seat wide open. Ms. Teachout is currently a favorite to win, she won almost every county in the district against Governor Cuomo in 2014. In the Democratic Primaries, she faces challenges from John Kehoe, a 29-year-old self-described moderate Democrat who runs a recording studio in the Hudson Valley, and Will Yandik, a town councilman from Columbia County, though popular consensus in the district s local Democratic Parties favor Ms. Teachout, according to the Poughkeepsie Journal.The Democratic Primaries take place on June 28th, 2016. On the Republican side, it will be a toss-up mainly between Andrew Heaney, a small businessman and graduate from Harvard Business School, and John Faso, a former New York State Assemblyman. Mr. Faso, who has hired Bill O Reilly as a communications consultant, has criticized Heaney for donating to President Obama s 2008 campaign. Mr. Heaney has also been accused of illegally coordinating with a Super-Pac he created, the New York Jobs Council.As progressivism has made its mark on the 2016 presidential election from the popularity of Senator Bernie Sanders  campaign, it has inspired progressive candidates across the country to run for office on similar platforms. Ms. Teachout s advice for those progressive candidates who are standing up to make their mark in a primary against an establishment backed candidate, as she did in 2014 against Governor Andrew Cuomo; spend as much time as you can on the ground listening to people, not in a closed room listening to donors. There s an extraordinary strength in the deep American grassroots and it s pretty exciting to see what could happen if you put a lot more trust in people.

TYRANNY: Obamaphone Fraud Kept Under Wraps Until Vote To Expand Program,"REMEMBER THE OBAMAPHONE LADY? Federal regulators were instructed to keep a massive fraud investigation under wraps until a day after a controversial vote to expand a program that was allegedly used to bilk taxpayers of tens of millions of dollars, one those regulators claims.The Federal Communications Commission on Friday announced that it would seek $51 million in damages from a cell phone company that allegedly defrauded the federal Lifeline program of nearly $10 million.The commission s five members unanimously backed the Notice of Apparent Liability (NAL), but Republican commissioner Ajit Pai parted from his colleagues in a partial dissent. According to Pai, he and other commissioners were told not to reveal the details of its investigation until April 1, a day after the FCC voted to expand the Lifeline program. Commissioners were told that the Notice of Apparent Liability could not be released or publicly discussed until April 1, 2016, conveniently one day after the Commission was scheduled to expand the Lifeline program to broadband,  Pai wrote.  That s not right. Pai did not say who issued that directive. However, it had the effect of preventing public knowledge of widespread fraud in the Lifeline program ahead of a contentious vote on expanding it despite persisting concerns about a lack of internal safeguards.FCC spokesman Will Wiquist insisted that the timing was completely coincidental.  The timing of the enforcement action was in no way related to the timing of the vote on the program modernization,  he said in an email.Lifeline has faced controversy over enrollment requirements that its critics say are too lax and vulnerable to fraud. The service, which subsidizes cell phone plans for low-income Americans, allows beneficiaries to enroll using cards issued for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), a welfare program that has also faced fraud allegations.Critics of the Lifeline program began calling its subsidized cell phones  Obamaphones  early in the Obama administration in response to viral YouTube videos of beneficiaries thanking the president for their free phones. The program was actually created under President Ronald Reagan.The FCC s NAL last week accused cell phone provider Total Call Mobile, which provides Lifeline services in 19 states, of  systematic and egregious misconduct  and  widespread enrollment fraud. According to the commission, Total Call employees enrolled tens of thousands of duplicate Lifeline beneficiaries and pocketed the extra subsidies. The FCC caught onto the scheme when the company enrolled an undercover FCC investigator in the program without asking for any eligibility documentation. Since 2014, Total Call has requested and received an estimated $9.7 million dollars in improper payments from the Universal Service Fund for duplicate or ineligible consumers despite repeated and explicit warnings from its own employees, in some cases compliance specialists, that company sales agents were engaged in widespread enrollment fraud,  the FCC said in a news release.A common means of fraudulent enrollment was the repeated use of a single SNAP identification card, according to the FCC. That drew the ire of Commissioner Michael O Reilly, who said the use of SNAP cards as Lifeline verification mechanisms is woefully inadequate. I must once again lodge my extreme frustration that the Commission continues to rely on SNAP as an entry point in the Lifeline program, and has the gall to claim that it is a highly accountable program, when it is painfully obvious to anyone paying attention that SNAP is riddled with waste, fraud, and abuse,  he wrote in a partial dissent in the Total Call case.Despite those ongoing concerns, the FCC recently voted to expand the Lifeline program to include subsidies for 3G wireless broadband service.That vote followed a contentious debate over the scope of the expansion and its accompanying price tag. The commission approved the expansion by a narrow 3-2 vote on March 31, a day before the FCC announced its Total Call NAL. Read more: WFB",Government News,"Apr 16, 2016",1

U.S. defense secretary scraps Afghan trip due to weather,"ABU DHABI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s defense secretary said bad weather had forced him to scrap a visit to Afghanistan on Sunday but added that he was reviewing the next steps in the war after discussions with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and the top U.S. commander. “We’re putting our thoughts together now,” Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters in Abu Dhabi during his debut trip to the Middle East. U.S. General John Nicholson, the commander of U.S. and international troops in Afghanistan, said this month the NATO-led force in Afghanistan had enough troops to carry out counterterrorism missions but had “a shortfall of a few thousand” for its major role of advising Afghan security forces. Mattis said he spoke for several hours on Sunday via video-link with Nicholson, but did not disclose whether he was in favor of sending more U.S. forces there. Mattis also said he spoke with Ghani “at length” before leaving Munich, Germany, on Saturday. So far, Trump has offered little clarity about whether he will approve more forces for Afghanistan, where some 8,400 U.S. troops remain more than 15 years after the Islamist Taliban government was toppled.  “He’s waiting for my assessment and the assessment from the intelligence community and he’s open to my advice on it,” Mattis said. “But first of all I’ve got to formulate where I stand.” Afghan government forces control no more than two-thirds of national territory, and have struggled to contain the Taliban insurgency since the bulk of NATO soldiers withdrew at the end of 2014. The government is also struggling with other militants, particularly from Islamic State’s Afghanistan branch. Islamic State claimed responsibility for a suicide attack that killed at least 22 people on Feb. 7 outside Afghanistan’s Supreme Court. A number of provincial capitals have been under pressure from the Taliban and Afghan government forces have been suffering high casualty rates, with more than 5,500 killed in the first eight months of 2016. “The Afghan security forces paid a very heavy price to keep the Taliban on their back foot. But they paid it, they held,” Mattis said. “And the Taliban’s in a worse position today, even though I do not equate that to success on our side.” ",politicsNews,"February 19, 2017 ",0
" White House Officials Caught Openly Mocking Trump, Administration In Free Fall (DETAILS)","Donald Trump s behavior and outlandish ways have made him countless enemies   and some of them are in the White House. Apparently, there s a lot of animosity over the fact that Trump s team keeps trying to do damage control and save Trump from the several federal investigations that are haunting the White House, and Trump continues to undo their hard work every day.This couldn t be more clear in the way the White House has reacted to Trump s lashing out at his own Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, on Friday morning. The Daily Beast is reporting that Trump s team is so disgusted by this, Trump s aides and advisers are actually mocking him and making jokes about how they can get him to shut the hell up.In response to Trump s tweet about Rosenstein this morning, in which Trump said I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! , an anonymous  senior Trump administration official  reportedly joked: Has anyone read his Miranda rights? At this point in Trump s flawed presidency, we all know that the best thing he could do for himself and his numerous criminal investigations would be to remain silent   which he is incapable of. One senior Trump administration official even placed blame on Trump for bringing the obstruction of justice inquiry upon himself. That senior aide said: The president did this to himself. Another White House official shared that no one in the administration is surprised when Trump goes off the rails on Twitter anymore. That official said that for  all the heartburn and misery , they should expect that dealing with Trump s insanity is just part of the job now: If you haven t made this a settled factor in your morning routine, why are you still here? Thanks to Trump s erratic behavior, GOP insiders are seriously worried that he s not mentally fit to continue on with the rest of his presidency. Republican strategist Evan Siegfried said: President Trump has started the clock on the Rosenstein firing watch. This is feeding the private discussions in the GOP about the president s state of mind. As Trump s erratic behavior gets worse, we can expect more White House and GOP leaks as Trump s team turns on him one by one.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,"June 16, 2017",1
Police have thwarted seven attacks since March: London mayor,"BRIGHTON, England (Reuters) - London Mayor Sadiq Khan said police had thwarted seven attacks by militants since March this year, describing the increase in the number as a shift rather than a spike. Speaking at the annual conference of his opposition Labour Party, Khan also said the police needed more spending to help them counter such attacks and that Internet companies must do more to crackdown on extremist content.  Between March this year and now, there have been four attacks but seven have been thwarted,  he told a Guardian Live event. Earlier this month, the head of the city s police force said six militant plots had been foiled over the last several months.     ",worldnews,"September 24, 2017 ",0
Obama's brother plans to vote for Trump," NAIROBI (Reuters) - President Barack Obama’s half-brother, Malik Obama, says he will vote for Republican nominee Donald Trump in the U.S. election in November because he likes the candidate and he is unhappy with his brother’s leadership.  Malik, who is in his 50s, told Reuters by phone from Obama’s ancestral home of Kogelo in western Kenya that he supports Trump’s policies, especially his focus on security.  “He appeals to me and also I think that he is down to earth and he speaks from the heart and he is not trying to be politically correct. He’s just straight-forward,” he said.

Trump’s stance against Muslims coming in to the United States was understandable even to Muslims like himself, Malik said.  “I’m a Muslim, of course, but you can’t have people going around just shooting people and killing people just in the name of Islam,” he said.  He criticized President Obama’s record in the White House saying he had not done much for the American people and his extended family despite the high expectations that accompanied his election in 2008, both in the United States and Kenya.  The two men appear to have drifted apart but were previously close. Malik has visited the president in the Oval office and was also best man at Barack’s wedding.  Obama’s election created much excitement in Kenya especially in Kogelo village where their father was born before going to study at the University of Hawaii.  Obama visited Nairobi, in the first ever trip by a sitting U.S. president to the East African nation last July, and promised to visit more often when he leaves office.  Malik defended his right to criticize his brother, citing freedom of expression.  “To each his own. I speak my mind and I’m not going to be put in a box just because my brother is the President of the United States,” Malik said.

Senate panel to vote next week on online sex-trafficking bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee will vote next week on a bipartisan proposal that would make it easier to penalize operators of websites that facilitate online sex trafficking, the panel said in a statement on Wednesday. U.S. technology companies including Alphabet’s Google and Facebook have long opposed legislation that would amend what is known as Section 230 of the decades-old Communications Decency Act, arguing it could thwart digital innovation and prompt endless litigation. The vote is a setback for the internet industry, which is witnessing shifting political fortunes in Washington on a range of policy issues after decades of relatively little regulatory scrutiny. Silicon Valley companies generally consider Section 230 a bedrock legal protection because it helps shield companies from liability for the activities of their users. The legislation from Republican Senator Rob Portman and Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal in August came after years of law-enforcement lobbying for a crackdown on the online classified site backpage.com, which is used for sex advertising. The measure would make it easier for states and sex-trafficking victims to sue social media networks, advertisers and others that fail to keep exploitative material off their platforms. In a statement, Portman said the lawmakers should “act with urgency to hold online sex traffickers accountable and give survivors the justice they deserve.” The bill has attracted bipartisan support from about a third of the Senate. A companion measure has similar backing in the House of Representatives. Republicans control both chambers.  Technology lobbyists in recent weeks have engaged in negotiations with lawmakers supportive of the bill in an attempt to narrow its impact. ",politicsNews,"November 1, 2017 ",0
Democrats probe whether Flynn pushed nuclear project as Trump aide,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic lawmakers are investigating whether retired U.S. General Michael Flynn secretly promoted a U.S.-Russian project to build dozens of nuclear reactors in the Middle East after becoming President Donald Trump’s first national security adviser. Representatives Elijah Cummings and Eliot Engel made the disclosure in a letter they sent on Tuesday to Flynn’s lawyer and executives of the private firms that developed the project. Flynn’s  now-defunct company worked as a consultant on it. Robert Kelner, Flynn’s lawyer, declined to comment. Separately on Wednesday, NBC News reported that Flynn’s son, Michael Flynn Jr., is being investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of his inquiry into U.S. allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election. Flynn worked for his father’s consulting firm. A lawyer for Flynn Jr. declined to comment to NBC. “The American people deserve to know whether General Flynn was secretly promoting the private interests of these businesses while he was a (Trump) campaign adviser, transition official, or President Trump’s national security adviser,” Cummings and Engel said in the letter made public on Wednesday. They asked Flynn’s lawyer and executives of the companies involved to provide “all communications” they had with Flynn or other administration officials during Flynn’s association with Trump. The project proposes to build 40 nuclear reactors across the Middle East that would feed a regional electric grid. The reactors would be “proliferation proof,” meaning they could not be used to produce fuel for nuclear weapons. A promotional slide of the project said security would be provided by Rosoboron, a Russian state-owned arms exporter that is under U.S. sanctions. The sanctions imposed during the administration of former President Barack Obama soured relations between Moscow and Washington and Trump said in his election campaign that he wanted to improve those ties. Intelligence reports indicate that some Trump associates may have violated a law called the Logan Act, which prohibits unauthorized U.S. citizens from negotiating with a foreign government that has a dispute with the United States, sources familiar with the reports said. Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Engel, the senior Democrat on the House Foreign Relations Committee, asked that the documents be provided by Oct. 4. The retired general is a central figure in Mueller’s investigation into whether Trump aides colluded with Russia to boost Trump’s campaign. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election and Trump has said there was no collusion. Trump, who took office on Jan. 20, fired Flynn on Feb. 13, 18 days after a top Justice Department official warned that the former Defense Intelligence Agency director could be blackmailed because Moscow knew he made misleading statements about his contacts with Russian officials. Cummings and Engel sent their letter as part of an inquiry into the renewal of Flynn’s 2016 Top Secret security clearance. They said Flynn failed to disclose a June 2015 trip he made to Egypt and Israel to promote the reactor project to investigators reviewing his renewal application and that he also did not list the foreigners with whom he met. The lawmakers wrote that replies from the executives and Kelner to a June letter confirmed that Flynn made the trip. “Based on your responses, it appears that General Flynn violated federal law,” they wrote. “Since these violations carry criminal penalties of up to five years in prison, we are providing your responses to Special Counsel Robert Mueller,” they wrote to Kelner, Alex G. Copson of X-Co Dynamics/ACU Strategic Partners, and retired Rear Admiral Michael Hewitt of X-Co Dynamics/Ironbridge Group/IP3. All are private companies. “Second, your responses raise significant questions about whether General Flynn continued to communicate with you and others about this project after the presidential election, after Donald Trump was sworn in as president, and after General Flynn assumed the post of national security adviser - without disclosing his foreign travel or contacts,” the lawmakers added. Donald Gross, counsel for ACU Strategic Partners, said the company has cooperated with the oversight committee in providing information about the project being developed along with Hewitt’s IP3, and “General Flynn’s limited involvement in June 2015.” Hewitt did not respond to a LinkedIn message seeking comment. The proposed reactor project would be funded by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab states and built and run by a consortium of U.S., Russian, French, Dutch, Arab, British, Ukrainian and Israeli firms.

 Conservative Heads EXPLODE After Obama Appoints Transgender Woman To Faith-Based Council (SCREENSHOTS),"President Barack Obama made history when he appointed a Christian Air Force veteran to the President s Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. Since conservatives love our troops, this is a move that they widely celebrat oh, wait   they have a problem with it.Satin is quite successful; she served as a member of the United Church of Christ s executive council with great success. In fact, she is the first openly transgender member of the UCC executive council, and was involved in the church s decision to include transgender individuals in the ministry of the church. Of course, her successes are the reason conservatives hate her. The White House notes that:Barbara Satin is the Assistant Faith Work Director for the National LGBTQ Task Force.  She is an active member of the United Church of Christ and served on the denomination s Executive Council as its first openly transgender member.  Ms. Satin recently worked on the development of Spirit on Lake, a LGBTQ senior housing project in Minneapolis.  She served on the Board of Directors for OutFront Minnesota from 2001 to 2008 and has served as Chair of GLBT Generations since 1999.  She has also served on the Board of Directors of PFund Foundation, a regional LGBTQ community foundation advancing social justice in Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin, since 2013. Given the current political climate, I believe it s important that a voice of faith representing the transgender and gender non-conforming community   as well as a person of my years, nearly 82   be present and heard in these vital conversations,  Satin said in a statement after the President selected her for her new position.The mission of the President s Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, which  brings together leaders and experts in fields related to the work of faith-based and neighborhood organizations in order to make recommendations to the Administration on how to improve the partnerships it forms to serve people in need,  is quite admirable.But conservatives just can t get past that whole  transgender  thing. In the comment section of The Blaze, our frenemies on the Right really let their hatred flow. Some complained that Obama appointed a  dude  (the only time in their lives in which they were angry about a white man being appointed to an important position),                Satin is a good woman who served her country honorably in the military and continues to do so. Conservatives, unfortunately, care nothing for that because she might or might not have a penis.Featured image via screengrab/CBN",News,"May 24, 2016",1
Moderate Collins back in prominent role in Senate tax drama,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Susan Collins is back in the spotlight as a crucial swing vote in the U.S. Senate as she raises questions about how combining a Republican tax-cut plan with a partial repeal of Obamacare will affect middle-class Americans.  A day after Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell decided to link the two issues in a risky strategy, Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, was citing data that she called worrisome, casting new doubts over the tax plan’s outlook. She told reporters in the Capitol on Wednesday that her staff’s research showed pairing tax cuts with an effective repeal of the individual mandate of Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), could be a mistake. “I have data that demonstrates for certain middle-income individuals and couples, who do not qualify for subsidies under the ACA ... that the premium increase will outweigh the tax cut that they get,” she said. “I suspected this, based on what I know about insurance markets, but now I have the actual data.” Collins was one of a handful of Republicans who voted in July to block a broader Republican attempt to dismantle Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law. The failure of the final repeal effort, in which Collins was joined in opposition by fellow Republicans John McCain and Lisa Murkowski, was a stinging defeat for President Donald Trump and Republican congressional leaders eager to fulfill their campaign promise to scrap Obamacare. Collins, 64, a senator since 1997, decided last month against running for governor of Maine in favor of staying in the Senate, where her status as a centrist Republican willing to work with Democrats has made her one of the most influential members of Congress. That has become especially obvious in recent months. After her role in halting Obamacare repeal efforts during the summer, she said in September she would oppose another Republican healthcare overhaul, known as Cassidy-Graham, leaving it short of the votes needed to pass. She cited concerns about its proposed cuts to the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor. Collins, along with McCain, Murkowski and Senator Ron Johnson, has emerged in the past 24 hours as pivotal to winning Senate approval of the tax-cut plan, which is backed by the president and is critical to the party’s 2018 electoral prospects as they seek their first major legislative win since Trump took office in January. In an unexpected move, McConnell on Tuesday inserted a proposed individual mandate repeal in the Senate tax plan. The mandate, long opposed by Republicans, requires Americans to have health insurance or pay a federal fine. The rule is meant to ensure enough young, healthy people are in Obamacare to offset the costs of covering sicker and older people. Repealing the mandate, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said last week, would increase the number of Americans without health insurance by 13 million by 2027 and raise average Obamacare marketplace insurance policy premiums by about 10 percent annually over the next decade. That premium increase could cancel out any tax-cut gains some middle-class Americans stand to make under the Senate tax plan, according to the research cited by Collins, who oversaw Maine’s Bureau of Insurance before she came to the Senate. Collins has not taken a stand on the tax plan. “I am going to wait and evaluate what is in the bill,” she said. “I do believe our taxes need to be overhauled. ... I just don’t know why we had to complicate it by bringing up the ACA.” Johnson, in a statement on Wednesday, said: “Neither the House nor Senate bill provide fair treatment, so I do not support either in their current version.” The Wisconsin lawmaker added he would work with his Republican colleagues to produce better legislation. Murkowski, when asked on Wednesday if she backed the tax-cut plan with a mandate repeal, said she was focused on opening Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil drilling, a key goal for the Alaska lawmaker. A committee that Murkowski chairs on Wednesday passed a bill to open ANWR to drilling, which is now expected to be attached to the tax legislation. ",politicsNews,"November 16, 2017 ",0
 WATCH: Chinese State Media Is Literally Laughing At American Embarrassment Trump,"Donald Trump has turned America into an international laughingstock and he hasn t even taken office yet.For weeks, Trump has been antagonizing China by speaking with the leader of Taiwan, which goes against decades of precedent, and has questioned the One-China policy. Both actions have put a strain on America s relationship with the most populous nation on Earth.Clearly, Donald Trump intends to keep taking aim at our largest trading partner, imperiling both our foreign policy and the world economy at a time when Americans are prospering under the economic successes of President Obama.Well, China is now laughing at Trump for being a national embarrassment.CNN s John Berman pointed out that an editorial by state-run Global Times of China mocked Trump. Trump s thinking about China is becoming increasingly clear: He wants China to make huge economic and trade concessions to the U.S. To achieve that, he is willing to stir certain calm areas in China-U.S. relations, including treating the Taiwan issues as his trump card. We were simply angry initially, but now we can t help but laugh at this U.S. leader-in-waiting. Maybe American voters  promoted  him too quickly, his amateur remarks and over-confident manner are equally shocking. Here s the video via YouTube.A separate editorial in the Global Times warns that Trump s arrogance will likely lead to a major confrontation between the United States and China.The  leader  of world order seems to be throwing away its job to grab the most advantages. The chaos it may bring to the world is much more severe than a war or a crisis. China faces the challenge of Trump s meddling with the one-China policy.Moreover, China may suffer from a shaken world order. The one-China policy is one part of the existing world order. Trump not only wants to scrap the one-China policy, but also aims at an overall change.In a changing landscape, enhancing one s own strength is most important. Trump has shown strategic arrogance that is beyond America s strength and he seems to be confident that anyone he asks will yield to him.It is quite likely that China and the US will face a head-on confrontation. China must be quick in preparing for sharp provocations from the Trump administration. China s win over this confrontation will serve as the basis for normal exchanges between the two in the future.This is why Americans need to oust Trump before it s too late. He is not only turning America into a joke on the world stage, he is bullying a nation that could punish us economically and go toe to toe with us militarily. We need to cultivate our relationship with China, not sever it. Antagonizing China will only piss them off and make things much more complicated. That s not what America needs right now.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"January 16, 2017",1
Obama administration ends special immigration policy for Cubans,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Thursday repealed a measure granting automatic residency to virtually every Cuban who arrived in the United States, whether or not they had visas, ending a longstanding exception to U.S. immigration policy. The end of the “wet foot, dry foot” policy, which allowed any Cuban who reached U.S. soil to stay but returned any picked up at sea, is effective immediately. Cuban officials had sought the change for years. The shift had been in the works for months. It was announced abruptly because advance warning might have inspired thousands more people to take to the seas between the Communist-ruled island and Florida in order to beat a deadline. The United States and Cuba spent several months negotiating the change, including an agreement from Cuba to allow those turned away from the United States to return. “With this change we will continue to welcome Cubans as we welcome immigrants from other nations, consistent with our laws,” Obama said in a statement. The Department of Homeland Security also ended a parole program that allowed entry for Cuban medical professionals. That program was unpopular with Havana because it prompted doctors to leave, sapping the country’s pool of trained health workers. The U.S. Coast Guard intercepts thousands of Cubans attempting the 90-mile (145-km) crossing to Florida every year, but tens of thousands who reach U.S. soil, including via Mexico, have been allowed to stay in the country, while immigrants from other nations have been rounded up and sent home. Cuba welcomed the policy changes, saying they would benefit the whole region by discouraging people-trafficking and dangerous journeys that led to bottlenecks of Cubans in Central America last year. “Today, a detonator of immigration crises is eliminated. The United States achieves legal, secure and ordered migration from Cuba,” said Josefina Vidal, the Cuban foreign ministry’s chief for U.S. affairs.  El Salvador’s foreign ministry also welcomed the move, saying “there cannot be migrants of different categories.” Honduras, from where thousands flee each year without the attraction of favorable U.S. immigration policies, said it would wait to see if the flow of Cubans actually reduced.  Anticipating the end of the policy, Cuban immigration has surged since the 2014 normalization, said Ben Rhodes, Obama’s deputy national security adviser. “People were motivated to migrate,” Rhodes told reporters on a call, noting some 40,000 Cubans arrived in 2015 and about 54,000 in 2016. The administration had rejected Cuban entreaties to overturn the policy before President Barack Obama’s historic visit to the island last year, although even some White House aides argued that it was outmoded given efforts to regularize relations between the former Cold War foes.  “Wet foot, dry foot” began in 1995 under President Bill Clinton after an exodus of tens of thousands of Cubans who were picked up at sea by the Coast Guard as they tried to reach Florida. Obama has been working to normalize relations with Cuba since he and President Raul Castro announced a breakthrough in diplomatic relations in December 2014. His administration has eased restrictions on travel and trade, allowing more U.S. business with Cuba and improved communications with the island. The move to end the policy comes just eight days before the Democratic president turns the White House over to Republican Donald Trump, who has said the United States should get more concessions from Havana in exchange for improved relations. U.S. immigration policy has given Cubans benefits granted to nationals from no other country. Until now, virtually every Cuban who made it to U.S. soil was granted the right to stay in the country, the right to apply for work permits and, later, green cards, which convey lawful permanent residency. Jeh Johnson, secretary of Homeland Security, said on a call that Cuba will take back citizens as long as less than four years have passed between the time the migrant left Cuba and the start of the U.S. deportation proceedings.  Under the agreement Cuba will take back some 2,700 people who left the island among 125,000 others during the Mariel boat lift of 1980, fulfilling an agreement made in 1984 to take back 2,746 people who the United States did not grant citizenship to, mainly people with criminal convictions.  Cuba has previously taken back only a handful of that group.  The new policy sparked mixed emotions in Miami’s Little Havana neighborhood.  Mario Garcia, a Cuban mechanic in Little Havana, said the change angered him. “It’s not like Communism has ended in Cuba, so why stop this that has saved people’s lives?” he said. But Eulalia Jimenez, who is Venezuelan, said the policy was not fair to migrants from other countries who also flee bad conditions. “Why should only the Cuban people be able to come and make a life for themselves?” Jimenez said.   Some U.S. lawmakers had been demanding a fresh look at the immigration rules, saying Cubans coming to the United States simply for economic reasons should not be automatically granted benefits intended for refugees. “This is a welcome step in reforming an illogical and discriminatory policy that contrasted starkly with the treatment of deserving refugees from other countries,” Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat, said in a statement. Republican Senator Jeff Flake also said eliminating the policy was “a win for taxpayers, border security and our allies in the Western Hemisphere.”  Flake and Leahy both support Obama’s moves toward freer trade and travel with Cuba. But U.S. Senator Marco Rubio said the incoming Trump adminstration should reverse the part of the executive order that ended the medical parole system, and said Cubans fleeing political persecution should receive asylum.  The Department of Homeland Security is also eliminating an exemption that prevented the use of expedited removal programs for Cuban nationals picked up at ports of entry or near the border. But an existing Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program is not affected by Thursday’s announcement and remains in effect. ",politicsNews,"January 12, 2017 ",0
Fake News: The Collapse of the MSM’s ‘Facebook Russian Bot’ Story,"As 21WIRE said last year, the Russian hacking, or Russiagate story was a political hoax from the start. What this story can now demonstrate, is that for the last 18 months, the entire mainstream media has been promulgating a highly politicised, and relentless campaign of fake news designed to implicate Russia in an imaginary scandal. Leading the pack are former  papers of record  The New York Times and The Washington Post, flanked by America s premier broadcast TV propaganda outlet CNN.Last week, we revealed how powerful politicians in Washington had pressured Facebook executives to come up with any evidence to support the Democratic Party s theory of  Russian meddling,    demonstrating clear collusion between the Obama Administration and Silicon Valley corporation Facebook, with the goal of fabricating a scandal in order to scapegoat Vladimir Putin and the Russians for the electoral collapse of Hillary Clinton last November.As a result, US-Russian relations have been sacrificed at the altar of petty partisan politics and a failing deep state agenda.It certainly begs the question: with so much at stake, why would Washington and MSM lie and risk pushing global tensions closer to a world war level confrontation? If they are prepared to lie about this, what else are they prepared to lie about?Consortium News Exclusive: The U.S. mainstream media is determined to prove Russia-gate despite the scandal s cracking foundation and its inexplicable anomalies, such as why Russia would set up a Facebook  puppies  page.By Robert ParryWhat is perhaps most unprofessional, unethical and even immoral about the U.S. mainstream media s coverage of Russia-gate is how all the stories start with the conclusion    Russia bad    and then make whatever shards of information exist fit the preordained narrative.For instance, we re told that Facebook executives, who were sent back three times by Democratic lawmakers to find something to pin on Russia, finally detected $100,000 worth of ads spread out over three years from accounts  suspected of links to Russia  or similar hazy wording.These Facebook ads and 201 related Twitter accounts, we re told, represent the long-missing proof about Russian  meddling  in the U.S. presidential election after earlier claims faltered or fell apart under even minimal scrutiny.In the old days, journalists might have expressed some concern that Facebook  found  the ads only under extraordinary pressure from powerful politicians, such as Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a leading legislator on the tech industry. But today s mainstream reporters took Warner s side and made it look like Facebook had been dragging its heels and that there must be much more out there.However, it doesn t really seem to matter how little evidence there is. Anything will do.Even the paltry $100,000 is not put in any perspective (Facebook has annual revenue of $27 billion), nor the 201 Twitter accounts (compared to Twitter s 328 million monthly users). Nor are the hazy allegations of  suspected   links to Russia  subjected to serious inspection. Although Russia is a nation of 144 million people and many divergent interests, it s assumed that everything must be personally ordered by President Vladimir Putin.Yet, if you look at some of the details about these $100,000 in ads, you learn the case is even flimsier than you might have thought. The sum was spread out over 2015, 2016 and 2017   and thus represented a very tiny pebble in a very large lake of Facebook activity.But more recently we learned that only 44 percent of the ads appeared before Americans went to the polls last November, according to Facebook; that would mean that 56 percent appeared afterwards.Facebook added that  roughly 25% of the ads were never shown to anyone.   For 50% of the ads, less than $3 was spent; for 99% of the ads, less than $1,000 was spent. So, as miniscule as the $100,000 in ad buys over three years may have seemed, the tiny pebble turns out really to be only a fraction of a tiny pebble if the Russians indeed did toss it into the 2016 campaign.What About the Puppies?We further have learned that most ads weren t for or against a specific candidate, but rather addressed supposedly controversial issues that the mainstream media insists were meant to divide the United States and thus somehow undermine American democracy.Except, it turns out that one of the issues was puppies.As Mike Isaac and Scott Shane of The New York Times reported in Tuesday s editions,  The Russians who posed as Americans on Facebook last year tried on quite an array of disguises.   There was even a Facebook group for animal lovers with memes of adorable puppies that spread across the site with the help of paid ads. Now, there are a lot of controversial issues in America, but I don t think any of us would put puppies near the top of the list. Isaac and Shane reported that there were also supposedly Russia-linked groups advocating gay rights, gun rights and black civil rights, although precisely how these divergent groups were  linked  to Russia or the Kremlin was never fully explained. (Facebook declined to offer details.)At this point, a professional journalist might begin to pose some very hard questions to the sources, who presumably include many partisan Democrats and their political allies hyping the evil-Russia narrative. It would be time for some lectures to the sources about the consequences for taking reporters on a wild ride in conspiracy land.Yet, instead of starting to question the overall premise of this  scandal,  journalists at The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, etc. keep making excuses for the nuttiness. The explanation for the puppy ads was that the nefarious Russians might be probing to discover Americans who might later be susceptible to propaganda. The goal of the dog lovers  page was more obscure,  Isaac and Shane acknowledged.  But some analysts suggested a possible motive: to build a large following before gradually introducing political content. Without viewing the entire feed from the page, now closed by Facebook, it is impossible to say whether the Russian operators tried such tactics. [Seriously, this is what the New York Times is passing off as  journalism  now]The Joe McCarthy of Russia-gateThe Times then turned to Clinton Watts, a former FBI agent and a top promoter of the New McCarthyism that has swept Official Washington. Watts has testified before Congress that almost anything that appears on social media these days criticizing a politician may well be traceable to the Russians Continue this story at Consortium NewsREAD MORE RUSSIAGATE NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Russiagate FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"October 5, 2017",1

"Obama hopeful on spending, Zika funds after meeting Congress leaders","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said after meeting with the top four congressional leaders on Monday he was encouraged that lawmakers would be able to pass short term spending legislation to keep the government open during the 2017 fiscal year.  Democrat Obama said he was hopeful about reaching agreements with the Republican-majority Congress on funding to fight the Zika virus and for disaster relief after flooding in Louisiana. The president met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan, both Republicans, and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi on issues that have been a struggle as his second term winds down. “My hope is that by the time Congress adjourns before the election that we will have an agreement in place to fund the government and that our Zika funding will be taken care of,” Obama told reporters in the Oval Office. Obama will leave office on Jan. 20.  Obama said he hoped Congress can make “modest progress” before the Nov. 8 elections and he was “even more hopeful we can get some things done,” after them. Congress must pass a temporary spending bill by Sept. 30 or much of the federal government will shut down. Shortly before the meeting with Obama, McConnell said congressional leaders were making progress on legislation on temporary spending and Zika. McConnell said he expected to advance the legislation in the Senate this week. Congressional leaders are considering attaching as much as $1.1 billion in Zika spending to the temporary spending bill. In February, Obama had asked Congress to approve $1.9 billion in emergency funds to fight Zika with diagnostic tools and vaccines, but disagreements over side issues related to abortion have led to divisions about full funding. Ryan spoke at the meeting about his desire to come to a speedy resolution on short term spending legislation that includes funding for Zika, an aide to the speaker said. Ryan also made clear his objections to doing a massive spending bill later in the year, the aide said. ",politicsNews,"September 12, 2016 ",0
OBAMA HOSTS FUNDRAISER: Praises Clinton For Great Job “Making Life and Death Decisions”….Like Benghazi?,"Obama hosted a fundraiser for a bunch of wealthy donors on Martha s Vineyard this week while riots and flooding devastate two cities. No mention of either situation in Obama s speech but Obama had time to take a swipe at Hillary Clinton s opponent in the presidential race. Obama said he s sick of talking about Trump  and went on to praise Clinton  great job  as secretary of state. What a joke! The funniest line of the night from Obama had to be this:Obama said Clinton is  not always the flashiest  but she is  the person who s going to do the work. Headlining a Democratic fundraiser while vacationing on Martha s Vineyard, President Obama said he is weary of mentioning Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and urged donors to continue backing Hillary Clinton. Frankly I m tired of talking about her opponent,  Obama told 60 donors who had paid $10,000 to attend the fundraiser. I don t have to make the case against her opponent because every time he talks, he makes the case against his own candidacy,  he said, according to a pool press report on his remarks provided by the Wall Street Journal. Obama also expressed a warning about the unpredictability of this election cycle. If we are not running scared until the day after the election, we are going to be making a grave mistake,  he said.As expected, Obama also had praise for Clinton, who served as his secretary of state after losing to him in the 2008 Democratic primary, saying he s seen her in  really tough pressure situations.   I m a Democrat, so it s fair to say that whoever the Democratic nominee was, I would want to get behind them,  Obama said, according to the pool report.  But I don t display the kinds of enthusiasm and energy and commitment to Hillary candidacy just because of the fact we belong to the same political party. He continued:  Until you sit at that desk and you re making life and death decisions, and you re deploying young men and women to war, or you re having to avert a crisis that could affect millions or in some cases billions of lives, you don t know how you re going to respond. Obama said Clinton is  not always the flashiest  but she is  the person who s going to do the work. Read more: Mass Live",politics,"Aug 16, 2016",1
" Trump Whines About His Obamacare Replacement, Gives The Most PATHETIC Reason Why It Sucks (VIDEO)","Earlier today, Donald Trump told a group of U.S. governors that his mysterious, frustratingly nonspecific replacement plan for Obamacare (also known as the Affordable Care Act) would give states more flexibility amongst other soaring promises. He also thanked some of the governors in the room for helping him because he obviously knew nothing about health care before he stepped into his role as POTUS   and he probably still doesn t.Trump s plan to repeal and replace Obamacare was a disaster from the start, and we re now seeing protests erupt across the country as millions of Americans stand to lose life-saving affordable health care if Trump gets his way. Many prominent GOPers have also spoken out against completely taking Obamacare away from the American people, but Trump isn t listening.In his speech, Trump addressed the reason why his plan has been so secretive and poorly planned. Stating that health care was  unbelievably complex , he said: We have come up with a solution that s really, really I think very good. It s an unbelievably complex subject. Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated. We have a plan that I think is going to be fantastic. It s going to be released fairly soon. I think it s going to be something special   I think you re going to like what you hear. And of course, he couldn t provide any details as usual. Despite bragging about the Republican Party s major move to repeal and replace a health care law that has given millions of Americans affordable, accessible health care, Trump and the GOP have done nothing but stall and beat around the bush. And yet despite having a concrete solution, Trump dissed Obamacare: As soon as we touch it, if we do the most minute thing, just a tiny little change, what s going to happen? They re going to say it s the Republicans  problem. But we have to do what s right because Obamacare is a failed disaster.

"Trump weighs revised travel ban, Supreme Court test still possible","PALM BEACH, Fla./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is considering issuing a new executive order banning citizens of certain countries traveling to the United States after his initial attempt to clamp down on immigration and refugees snarled to a halt amid political and judicial chaos. Trump announced the possibility of a “brand new order” that could be issued as soon as Monday or Tuesday, in a surprise talk with reporters aboard Air Force One late on Friday, as he and the Japanese premier headed to his estate in Florida for the weekend.  His signaling of a possible new tack came a day after an appeals court in San Francisco upheld a court ruling last week that temporarily suspended Trump’s original Jan. 27 executive order banning travel from seven majority-Muslim countries.  Trump gave no details of any new ban he is considering. He might rewrite the original order to explicitly exclude green card holders, or permanent residents, said a congressional aide familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified. Doing that could alleviate some concerns expressed by the courts. A new order, however, could allow Trump’s critics to declare victory by arguing he was forced to change course in his first major policy as president. Whether or not Trump issues a new order, his administration may still  pursue its case in the courts over the original order, which is still being reviewed by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus told reporters late on Friday that taking the case to the Supreme Court remained a possibility, after another White House official said earlier in the day the administration was not planning to escalate the dispute. “Every single court option is on the table, including an appeal of the Ninth Circuit decision on the TRO (temporary restraining order) to the Supreme Court, including fighting out this case on the merits,” Priebus said. “And, in addition to that, we’re pursuing executive orders right now that we expect to be enacted soon that will further protect Americans from terrorism.” Trump’s original order, which he called a national security measure meant to head off attacks by Islamist militants, barred people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days, except refugees from Syria, who were banned indefinitely. The abrupt implementation of the order plunged the immigration system into chaos, sparking a wave of criticism from targeted countries, Western allies and some of America’s leading corporations, especially technology firms. A federal judge in Seattle suspended the order last Friday after its legality was challenged by Washington state, eliciting a barrage of angry Twitter messages from Trump against the judge and the court system. That ruling was upheld by an appeals court in San Francisco on Thursday, raising questions about Trump’s next step. An official familiar with Trump’s plans said if the order is rewritten, among those involved would likely be White House aide Stephen Miller, who was involved in drafting the original order, as well as officials of the National Security Council, Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security. It is not clear if a new order from Trump would immediately put a travel ban back in place, or if those who have filed lawsuits, including the state of Washington, would succeed in asking the same judge for another hold. Should Trump issue a new order, he is still likely to face legal challenges, as opponents could ask the court to let them amend their complaints, said Alexander Reinert, a professor at Yeshiva University’s Cardozo School of Law in New York.  On Air Force One, Trump addressed the San Francisco court fight, saying: “We will win that battle. The unfortunate part is that it takes time statutorily... We need speed for reasons of security.” The matter could move forward next week. An unidentified judge on the 9th Circuit on Friday requested that the court’s 25 full-time judges vote on whether the temporary block of Trump’s travel ban should be reheard before an 11-judge panel, known as en banc review, according to a court order. The 9th Circuit asked both sides to file briefs by Thursday.      In a separate case on Friday, Justice Department lawyers argued in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia against a preliminary injunction that would put a longer hold on Trump’s executive order than the Seattle court ruling, but focused solely on visa holders. Judge Leonie Brinkema asked the administration for more evidence of the threat posed by citizens of the seven countries. Aboard the flight with Trump were his wife Melania, daughter Ivanka, son-in-law Jared Kushner and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife Akie. The Trumps landed in the evening and went to their Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach. ",politicsNews,"February 9, 2017 ",0
 Trump Calls On White Supporters To Intimidate Voters At The Polls,"Earlier this month, the Trump campaign posted on its website an advertisement seeking election observers to monitor locations. The move, which is unusual for private campaigns, comes from the irrational fear that should Hillary Clinton win, the election would be rigged. So Trump s solution? Have his rabid, conspiracy theory believing supporters intimidate voters in poll lines.In Pennsylvania, where polls have Clinton ahead by as much as nine points, Trump claims the only way Clinton could win is if she cheats or those in the Democratic Party  rig  the election in her favor. So his initial call was to have his supporters monitor the stations in the predominantly black and minority -voting urban areas of the state.It was very reminiscent of the 1960s Jim Crow intimidation of the South.After facing some backlash for the dangerous and archaic call to suppress and intimidate voters, Trump doubled down on his claim that the election will be rigged and that supporters should  watch  the polling locations very closely on election day:You ve got to get every one of your friends. You ve got to get every one of your family. You ve got to get everybody to go out and watch. And go out and vote. And when I say watch, you know what I m talking about, right? You know what I m taking about. I think you got to go out and you got to watch.The question is just what should his people be watching for? Should they be watching and  observing  people of color? Should they be monitoring young, college-aged millenials? Should they be asking voters their personal information so they can play Sherlock Holmes?Once again, Trump sounds his dog whistle. When he tells his predominantly white audience,  you know what I m talking about,  the innuendo could not be more clear: watch, intimidate and disenfranchise minority voters.Of course, Republicans, who have been pushing the now widely debunked myth of rampant voter fraud, will be mum on this. In justification, they will point to the said myth that is rampant voter fraud as why they support this dangerous, racist and damaging call to action.Trump s call to intimidate voters should be a warning to all Americans: don t get complacent. Get out, vote, and take this monstrosity down.Featured image via Angelo Meredino/Getty Images",News,"August 23, 2016",1
Trump's pick for national security adviser turns down offer: White House official,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s choice for national security adviser, retired Vice Admiral Robert Harward, has turned down the offer, a senior White House official said on Thursday. Harward was offered the job after Michael Flynn was fired by Trump on Monday for misleading Vice President Mike Pence over his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the United States. The White House official said Harward cited family and financial reasons for opting not to take the job. Harward is a senior executive at Lockheed Martin. Two sources familiar with the decision said Harward turned down the job in part because he wanted to bring in his own team. That put him at odds with Trump, who had told Flynn’s deputy, K.T. McFarland, that she could stay. Trump appeared to refer to Harward earlier in the day at a presidential news conference, saying: “I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position.” The president also made clear why he asked Flynn to resign, saying it was because the retired lieutenant general had not been completely truthful with Pence about his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak. “The thing is, he didn’t tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn’t remember. So either way, it wasn’t very satisfactory to me,” Trump said. ",politicsNews,"February 16, 2017 ",0

 MSNBC Pundit: Trump Pushes ‘White Racist Supremacist Nationalism’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is a racist. That is a fact that cannot be disputed. He has the support of white supremacists and other professional bigots, and yet the GOP elite continue to line up behind him, all while swearing they aren t racists. Well MSNBC political commentator Michael Eric Dyson has had enough.During a conversation with Republican strategist Alex Castellanos, Dyson unloaded and pointed out that Trump is promoting white nationalism during a conversation regarding the United Kingdom s Brexit vote. It is, in fact the same sort of dangerous xenophobia, racism, and nationalism that caused people in Britain to vote pro-Brexit. As we are now seeing, it is not a good thing in the United Kingdom, and that same sort of nationalism that drives Trump s political success is not a good thing here in America either. Here is a transcript of the exchange, via Media Matters:ALEX CASTELLANOS: The Brexit vote is a vote for the idea of nationhood.MICHAEL ERIC DYSON: It s nationalism.CASTELLANOS: Right, in Europe you ve destroyed borders. You can travel anywhere. Immigration has destroyed borders. There are no economic borders now. Greece can spend money that Germany has to pay back. The British looked at this and said, we think being a nation is a good idea and that we ought to be one.DYSON: But nationalism is not the answerCASTELLANOS: Of course it is.DYSON: I m saying nationalism within AmericaCASTELLANOS: There were nations before the EU. There will be nations afterwards. This is not a crisis. And when Donald Trump talks about building a wall  DYSON: For who?CASTELLANOS:   what people are hearing is we ought to have a real nation for all of us.DYSON: Donald Trump s nation doesn t represent all of us. When he keeps saying he wants to ban Muslims. He wants to keep immigrants out. He wants to build a wall. And look, at his rallies, when black people are pushed around, he then says, I will pay for the legal fees. Donald Trump amplifies the worst instincts. And his nationalism is really a white racist supremacist nationalism that reeks terror on the American democratic experiment.Dyson is right. Trump s divisive, violent, racist rhetoric only serves to prey on people s fears, ignorance, and prejudices. It divides rather than unites. Diversity is a beautiful thing, but if Donald Trump has his way, there will be no such thing.Watch the exchange below, again via Media Matters:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"June 26, 2016",1

 How Trump Is Hiding From The Media Like A Total Coward,"Donald Trump has a reputation in the media for being open and accessible to interview requests. He is known for a willingness to spout off to whoever sticks a microphone in front of his face, and it has helped him get this far as a political candidate.But lately, as Trump has hired new handlers and other assorted campaign personnel, he has also been in something of a retreat. That is, Trump is only talking to Fox News right now.Trump is saying  yes  to Fox News almost every day but saying  no  to most other major networks and news organizations   a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee.He called into  Fox & Friends  on Monday morning, he is booked on  The O Reilly Factor  Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday.Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidate s exposure to hard-hitting questions   while fueling frustration among journalists.At Fox News, Trump can avoid pesky follow-up questions about his support for the racist birther conspiracy, long after he claims to have dropped it. Fox News hosts won t ask him why he reacts to possible terrorism by screaming about how he was right, rather than express condolences for the victims and support for law enforcement. At Fox News, Trump isn t challenged   and that s the way he wants it.The problem is, wrapping up in the Fox News cocoon may feel good for the time being, but the way to win an election is to appeal to audiences outside of your base of comfort. Trump isn t reaching out.It is a strategy that shows up elsewhere in his campaign, where instead of following the model of successful politicians like George W.

DANISH CITY OVERRUN WITH MUSLIM MIGRANTS Makes Pork Mandatory On All Municipal Menus,"Assimilate or go hungry  Human rights lawyers descend in 5 4 3 2 1 COPENHAGEN, Denmark   A Danish city has ordered pork to be mandatory on municipal menus, including for schools and daycare centers, with politicians insisting the move is necessary for preserving the country s food traditions and is not an attack on Muslims.Frank Noergaard, a member of the council in Randers that narrowly approved the decision earlier this week, says it was made to ensure that pork remains  a central part of Denmark s food culture. Denmark is a major pork producer and it is the most popular meat, but it is forbidden to Muslims and Jews. Most of the asylum-seekers who have arrived in the country in the past months are Muslim.Noergaard, a member of the anti-immigration, populist Danish People s Party that proposed the council motion, said Thursday that it wasn t meant as a  harassment of Muslims,  but added that he had received  several complaints about too many concessions  being made to Muslims in the small, predominantly Lutheran country. The signal we want to send here is that if you re a Muslim and you plan to come to Randers, don t expect you can impose eating habits on others. Pork here is on an equal footing with other food,  Noergaard told The Associated Press. He said that halal meat, vegetarian dishes and diets for diabetics would still be available.In 2013, then-Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt lashed out at some nurseries after they started serving halal-butchered meat instead of pork because Muslim children had refused to eat it.

ENTIRE HIGH SCHOOL FOLLOWS KAEPERNICKS Lead In Disrespecting The National Anthem,"It seems that Colin Kaepernick has become more of an influence in our youths life then any of us would have hoped for.

The move is spreading like an oozing wound, and unfortunately his job a role-model and mentor has been compromised.The coach of the Garfield Seattle High School football team should be ashamed of himself for not only allowing this type of action but for joining in on it!The coach stated that they will continue this action before every game  until they tell us to stop.

 Nate Silver: Being Black In America Is About As Dangerous As Rwanda,"White privilege is about the fact that for Americans life is very different depending on skin color. The differences can be seen through all aspects of life, but the most stark is the fact that white people are much, much more likely to die of old age than are black people. In fact, data guru Nate Silver says that to be black in America is just about as bad as living in war torn Rwanda.Gun arguments aside if you re white in America, you re pretty damned safe. Your chance of being murdered in any given year is 2.5 out of 10,000. That s about equal to Finland, Israel and Chile. To be black, though, is very different. Your odds of being murdered about about eight times higher, or 19.4 out of every 10,000. That compares to Myanmar, Rwanda, Mexico, Brazil and Nigeria.Silver rarely expresses his political opinions (other than statistical predictions) but he did editorialize a bit on police brutality: So I m an editor now as well as a writer so we think when a story occurs is this a quote unquote  random act of violence  or is this representative of some broader trend and I think these stories about police brutality, it s uncovering things that have been going on for a long time and that are very common experiences Now that we do have video cameras everywhere it s not a coincidence that all of a sudden now that we have means to record these things all of a sudden these things crop up all the time.

While white women might be harassed or worse on the street, we re fairly confident we ll make it home alive. White men are even more confident of that fact. To be black on the other hand, means always being on guard and always on your best behavior. Don t loiter, but don t walk (or drive) fast. Don t put your hands in your pockets. Don t make eye contact with police. Don t not look at police when you re being spoken to. The list could go on. The rules for being black are simply different than the rules for being white.

Senior justice official dismisses Republican charges of bias in Trump probe,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Wednesday dismissed Republican lawmakers’ charges that government attorneys and agents investigating allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election are biased against President Donald Trump. Republicans have attacked Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who has charged four Trump associates in his investigation, which is also looking into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow officials. Testifying before the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, Rosenstein said he was “not aware” of any impropriety by Mueller’s team. When the committee’s ranking Democrat asked if he had any good cause for firing Mueller, he replied: “No.”         Russia denies the conclusions by three U.S. intelligence agencies that Moscow used hacking and disinformation to affect the election, and Trump says there was no collusion.     At the hearing, Republicans on the committee increased their criticism of Mueller, highlighting text messages between two Federal Bureau of Investigation employees, including an agent on his investigating team, as evidence of bias against Trump. So far, however, congressional Republicans have stopped short of calling on Trump to fire Mueller. Republicans said they had reviewed more than 300 anti-Trump text messages exchanged last year between FBI lawyer Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, an FBI agent who worked on Mueller’s probe. Members of the committee read aloud the contents of some of the text messages between Strzok and Page.      Some texts call Trump an “idiot” and a “loathsome human,” according to copies of a sampling of the texts reviewed by Reuters. In one July 2016 exchange they poked fun at Trump’s campaign during the Republican National Convention. “My god, I’m so embarrassed for them. These are like second-run stars,” Page responded to Strzok. “And wow, Donald Trump is an enormous d*uche.” The texts showed “extreme bias against President Trump, a fact that would be bad enough if it weren’t for the fact that these two individuals were employed as part of the Mueller ‘dream team’ investigating the very person for whom they were showing disdain,” said Bob Goodlatte, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee. In some of the texts seen by Reuters, however, Strzok did not seem excited about Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, either. Describing himself as a “conservative Democrat,” he in one text openly worried about her getting elected, and at one point complained that certain news media outlets were biased for downplaying her ties to the oil and gas industry. “This is clear and utter bias by the media specifically the NYTIMES, WAPO, and CNN who if you look at all of them have large donors for Clinton,” he wrote.        Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller, said the special counsel properly removed Strzok from the probe after the Justice Department inspector general brought the texts to light, and added he was confident Mueller is not letting political bias color the investigation. He also said he thinks Mueller is the “ideal choice” to lead the investigation, and said that just because a person is affiliated with a political party does not mean he or she will be biased. He said he had discussed the issue of bias with Mueller and that Mueller “is running that office appropriately.” ",politicsNews,"December 13, 2017 ",0
Saudi-led coalition calls missile 'dangerous escalation' of Yemen conflict,"RIYADH (Reuters) - A Saudi-led coalition accused Yemen s Houthi militia of a  dangerous escalation  on Sunday after Saudi air defense forces intercepted a ballistic missile fired towards Riyadh. Saudi Arabia also announced financial rewards for information leading to the arrest of 40 leaders it said were responsible for  planning, implementing and supporting the Houthi terrorist group s various terrorist activities . The bounties topped out at $30 million for the armed group s leader, Abdel-Malek al-Houthi, the state news agency reported. The missile was brought down on Saturday evening near King Khaled International Airport on the northern outskirts of the capital and did not cause any casualties.      The Houthis  dangerous escalation came because of Iranian support,  coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Maliki said in a televised news conference. Rocket launch vehicles used to fire the missile were made in Iran, he added. Saudi Arabia and its allies accuse arch-foe Iran of supplying missiles and other weapons to the Houthis, saying the arms were not present in Yemen before the conflict began in 2015. Iran denies the charges and blames the conflict on Riyadh. Yemen s civil war pits the internationally recognized government, backed by Saudi Arabia and its allies, against the Houthis and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh. The war has already killed more than 10,000 and displaced millions, with around 500,000 cholera cases reported in the country since the worst outbreak in decades started in April. The Saudi-led coalition s statement on Sunday echoed accusations by U.S. President Donald Trump, who described the missile as  a shot just taken by Iran  against Saudi Arabia. The head of Iran s Revolutionary Guard Corps dismissed Trump s comments as slander. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Sunday the missile launch by Houthi rebels showed there was a danger of ballistic proliferation across the region. Saudi Arabia has signaled its intention to buy separate air defense systems from the United States and Russia. ",worldnews,"November 5, 2017 ",0
Senate Budget Committee approves Mulvaney as budget director,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Budget Committee on Thursday voted to confirm Republican Congressman Mick Mulvaney as White House budget director under President Donald Trump. Senators narrowly approved Trump’s nominee along party lines in a 12-11 vote. Democrats criticized him for hard line fiscal positions on popular social programs and for failing to pay more than $15,000 in taxes in relation to a household employee until after he was nominated. His nomination will now move to the Senate floor for a full confirmation vote.  Mulvaney, a South Carolina Republican and a leading member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, favors raising the Social Security retirement age to 70 and means-testing beneficiaries of the Medicare healthcare program. Budget committee Chairman Mike Enzi, a Wyoming Republican, told the panel Mulvaney is “uniquely qualified” to be budget director: “He is a proven budget hawk that’s been vocal about our need to rein in government spending and debt.”      But the nominee came under fire from Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination last year.  The Vermont lawmaker warned that Mulvaney’s positions on Social Security and Medicare contradict Trump’s campaign statements to leave the programs untouched. Sanders also said his failure to pay taxes for a nanny he employed from 2000 to 2004 should disqualify him as a nominee.   Sanders and fellow independent Angus King of Maine voted with the committee’s nine Democrats to oppose Mulvaney. ",politicsNews,"February 2, 2017 ",0

" Justice Thomas Asks Idiotic Question, Shows Us All Why He’s Been Silent For A Decade","The death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has raised many questions and left the fate of the Supreme Court up in the air, especially since the GOP is flat-out refusing to allow President Obama s potential nominees through, no matter who they might be. However, Scalia s sudden demise also had another unintended   and very unexpected   effect: it made notoriously silent Justice Clarence Thomas open his mouth for the first time in literally a decade.The case before the court involved the 1996 law that stopped domestic abusers from owning firearms again. Being the staunch conservative that he is, Thomas didn t agree with this, and seemed to imply that wife beaters should be able to own guns, despite the very good reasons for prohibiting them from doing so. So, Thomas s first utterance on the court in the last ten years was also incredibly stupid. He asked: Can you give me another example where a misdemeanor suspends a constitutional right permanently? There was an audible gasp of surprise from the court; after all, many folks there probably don t even know what Clarence s voice sounds like. But, now, we understand why he didn t speak. He s clearly a f*cking moron. As Winning Democrats reports, Thomas decided to go to bat for the gun rights of violent men and engaged in the following tit-for-tat with Ilana Eisenstein, a Justice Department attorney: You re saying that a misdemeanor conviction results in a lifelong ban on possessing a gun,  Thomas said.  Which at least right now is a constitutional right. In these cases, did any of the petitioners use a weapon? Eisenstein responded that they had not. So it is not directly related  to the original crime, Thomas asked.Well, it seems that with Scalia gone, Thomas will be the one to fight for the rights of abusers everywhere to go on and kill the partners they victimize. Way to carry a monumentally stupid and dangerous torch, Justice Thomas. Shame on you.Featured image via screen capture from DailyNebraskan",News,"February 29, 2016",1
Powell faces early test of policy view as tax cuts near approval,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Incoming Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, chosen by U.S. President Donald Trump to keep the recovery humming, appears set to let an expected trillion=dollar tax cut run its course through the economy as weak wage growth and inflation buttress his view that the economy remains underpowered. Powell in statements throughout the year, culminating with his recent Senate confirmation hearing, has been clear he sees little risk of inflation that would prompt the Fed to raise rates faster than expected, and takes weak wage growth as a sign that sidelined workers remain to be drawn into jobs. New data added evidence to that view on Friday. Employment in November grew faster than expected, but wage growth remained muted. The share of working age adults with jobs continued a steady, six-year recovery that is approaching its pre-crisis peak. Even with the unemployment rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, “there’s no sense of an overheating economy or a particularly tight labor market,” Powell told members of the Senate Banking Committee, saying that the Fed should raise rates only gradually.  Debate among Powell’s colleagues, meanwhile, has highlighted other risks if the Fed speeds its pace of rate increases. Some policymakers feel the central bank has already undercut its credibility by raising interest rates while inflation remains so weak. Others have noted that if the Fed continues raising short-term rates while long-term rates remain stalled, it could turn the shape of the bond yield curve upside down, a typical signal of recession.  “If the Fed gets its paradigm wrong and sees inflation that ultimately doesn’t materialize, and they take rates too far, then markets would feel aggrieved,” said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago, and a former senior risk official at the Fed Board. Other analysts are starting to see a potential dovish surprise when Powell takes over in February, the tax cuts could kick in, and the Fed stands aside.   With a background as an investment banker rather than as an economist rooted in a particular analytical framework, Powell will lead “a more data-driven Fed, which at the current juncture means a more dovish Fed,” until and if inflation recovers, said Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance.  He expects the Fed under Powell to only raise rates twice next year.   Policymakers will give an initial reading on the impact of the Republican tax plan when they meet next week. They are expected to raise interest rates for the third time this year. They will also update their economic and interest rate projections for 2018 and beyond, the first such forecasts since the outlines of the tax overhaul became clear. Top Republicans from the House and the Senate are rushing to complete negotiations to push the tax plan into law.   Though Janet Yellen remains Fed chair until February, her final scheduled press conference on Wednesday afternoon will set the policy backdrop Powell inherits. The 64-year-old lawyer will attend the meeting as a sitting governor, and help shape the statement issued that day by the Federal Open Market Committee. It is a group struggling with a fundamental issue. The economy is arguably as much as a half a percentage point below full employment, a condition in which prices and wages should be rising. Yet both remain weak. Into that mix, the tax cut legislation would put tens of billions of dollars back in the hands of corporations and households.  If there is still “slack” in the economy, that could produce faster real growth as spending and investment increase, and more workers are hired. However, if the economy is near or above its potential, as some measures indicate, it may merely cause faster-than-desired price increases, or a jump in stock and other asset values that raise concerns of a bubble.  As the tax plan advanced in Congress, forecasting shops at Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and others penciled in a faster pace of Fed rate increases - essentially expecting the Fed would need to lean against the inflationary outcome. The tax package is “ultimately worth almost two additional Fed hikes” in coming years, Goldman Sachs economists David Mericle and Alec Phillips wrote in a recent analysis. But the new chair’s own public speeches and comments throughout the past year have shown an evolving faith that the Fed’s go-slow approach can continue, giving more time for workers to rebound from the 2007-2009 crisis without creating other economic risks. “Accommodative policy did not generate high inflation or excessive credit growth; rather, it helped restore full employment,” Powell said in June in his last extensive speech on monetary policy before he emerged as a contender for the top Fed job.  His outlook is consistent with positions Trump and current chair Janet Yellen have taken, and the depth of his commitment to that view will be a critical part of the Fed’s debate about whether and how to react to the tax plan. At his confirmation hearing, Powell avoided any direct critique or endorsement of the pending legislation, telling lawmakers fiscal policy was their domain. But when asked about Fed staff research that challenged a key Republican premise that corporate tax cuts generate jobs, Powell kept his distance. “It’s just someone’s research,” Powell told senators. “Don’t associate that with a position of the board.” ",politicsNews,"December 11, 2017 ",0
Taiwan says Chinese air force exercised near island 16 times in last year,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - China s air force has carried out 16 rounds of exercises close to Taiwan in the last year or so, Taiwan s defense ministry said on Tuesday, warning that China s military threat was growing by the day. China considers self-ruled and democratic Taiwan to be its sacred territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring what it views as a wayward province under Chinese control. China has taken an increasingly hostile stance towards Taiwan since Tsai Ing-wen from the island s pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party won presidential elections last year. Beijing suspects her of pushing for the island s formal independence, a red line for China. Tsai says she wants peace with China, but that she will defend Taiwan s security and way of life. In a lengthy report, Taiwan s defense ministry listed the number of times China s air force had drilled near the island since the end of October last year and which aircraft were involved, including bombers and advanced fighter jets. Of the 16 drills, 15 of them were around Taiwan, flying through the Bashi Channel which separates Taiwan from the Philippines and near Japan s Miyako island, to the north of Taiwan. The other drill was through the Bashi Channel and out into the Pacific. China has repeatedly said the drills are routine. Taiwan s defense ministry said China was the island s biggest security threat.  The Chinese military s strength continues to grow rapidly,  it said.   There have been massive developments in military reforms, combined operations, weapons development and production, the building of overseas military bases and military exercises, and the military threat towards us grows daily.  Chinese missiles can already cover all of Taiwan, and China has been improving its abilities in long-range anti-ship missiles  to build an ability to resist foreign forces , the ministry added. Tensions rose earlier this month after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened that China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits there. Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S.-made weapons, but has been pressing Washington to sell more advanced equipment. The United States is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, to China s distaste. Proudly democratic Taiwan has shown no interest in being run by autocratic China, and Taiwan s government has accused Beijing of not understanding what democracy is all about when it criticizes Taipei.

According to a full program of the Nov. 26-Dec. 2 trip released by the Vatican on Tuesday, the pope will say two Masses in Buddhist-majority Myanmar and one in Bangladesh, which is predominantly Muslim. Francis will be the first pope to visit Myanmar and the second to visit Bangladesh, where Pope John Paul visited in 1986. The pope arrives in Yangon, the country s largest city, on Nov. 27 after a flight of more than 10 hours and is scheduled to rest for about 24 hours before heading to the country s capital Naypyitaw for a day.   There, he will have separate private talks with President Htin Kyaw and Suu Kyi, who is both State Counsellor and Foreign Minister, making her effectively the country s civilian leader.   A senior Vatican official said military leaders are expected to attend a separate, public meeting where the pope will address politicians and diplomats. This is where he is expected to give the keynote speech of the trip.   Myanmar is facing international scrutiny over the plight of its Rohingya community.

CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON’S Latest Speech To Be Crashed By Angry HAITIANS Pushing For Answers,"Hillary Clinton always goes back to the black community and this is just another case of pandering. It s pretty sickening that she s even being asked to speak at a college commencement ANY college commencement! The Clinton GRIFTERS also owe the Haitian community answers on where money went after the Haiti earthquake relief effort.  The Haitian community is up in arms over much that happened after the 2010 earthquake. This should be interesting:Here is how the Clinton s used the money that Americans donated to help the devastated residents of Haiti to enrich themselves:On June 8, Hillary Clinton is scheduled to serve as the Class of 2017 commencement speaker at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, New York, where she will also be awarded an honorary degree. The announcement has incited protests from several members of the Haitian community who plan to protest the speech and are pushing the college s president, Rudy Crew, to rescind the invitation.PANDERING TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY IN TIMES OF TROUBLE: Every time the Clintons get in a bind, they run to the black community to whitewash their tarnished image,  said Komokoda, the Haitian group protesting the speech, in a statement.  After Bill Clinton was impeached for lying under oath in the Monica Lewinsky affair, he brought in Jesse Jackson and a host of black preachers to lead prayers with him at the White House. To divert attention from her  deleted emails  debacle, Hillary had Bill DeBlasio s wife, Chirlane McCray, bring her to Brownsville, one of the most impoverished neighborhoods in Brooklyn, for a photo op with little black children. When newspaper editorials and cartoons were blasting her for her unending lies and demanding investigations and prosecutions, former New York City mayor David Dinkins brought her out for a keynote speech at his Dinkins Leadership & Public Policy Forum at Columbia University. Today, for her resurrection from a shameful defeat by the last person most reasonable people felt could ever be president of the United States, the dirty work falls to Rudy Crew. HAITI RELIEF SCAM   QUESTIONS REMAIN:The Clintons  role in Haiti has incited immense criticism and has tarnished their relationship with the Haitian community. In 2010, Haiti suffered a massive earthquake. Several NGOs and the United Nations flocked to Haiti to help relief efforts, but their intervention came with several costs. In 2011, UN Peacekeepers caused a massive cholera outbreak that killed at least 9,500 people and sickened 800,000 others. During this time, Bill Clinton served as the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti while Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state. While the Clinton Foundation has staunchly defended their role in Haiti, their involvement in the country has been far from successful.  Many of the most notable investments the Clintons helped launch, such as the new Marriott in the capital, have primarily benefited wealthy foreigners and the island s ruling elite, who needed little help to begin with,  wrote Jonathan Katz for Politico in 2015.For Komokoda and many Haitians, the Clintons epitomize NGOs and corporations exploiting the crisis and relief efforts in Haiti for their own gain. Haitians also blame the Clintons for the controversial rule of former Haitian President Michel Martelly, who stepped down in February 2016 due to his record of corruption after the Clintons helped him get elected in 2010.MORE ON THE CLINTON FOUNDATION SCAM ON HAITI:Read more: Observer",left-news,"May 19, 2017",1
"Peru's Fujimori taken to hospital from prison, life at risk: doctor","LIMA (Reuters) - Peru s former President Alberto Fujimori was rushed from prison to a local hospital by ambulance late on Saturday after suffering a severe drop in blood pressure and abnormal heart rhythm that put him at risk of dying, Fujimori s doctor said. Cardiologists recommended that he be removed from prison immediately, Alejandro Aguinaga said.  It looks complicated,  he told journalists gathered outside the hospital. Fujimori, 79, is serving a 25-year sentence for graft and human rights crimes. He is a deeply divisive figure in Peru. While many consider him a corrupt dictator, others credit him with ending an economic crisis and bloody leftist insurgency during his 1990-2000 term. The medical emergency will likely heap pressure on center-right President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski to free the former  leader, a move that could rewrite political alliances and spark protests in one of Latin America s most stable economies. Three days earlier, a faction of Fujimori s supporters in Congress unexpectedly saved Kuczynski from a motion that would have forced him from office less than two years into his five-year-term. The opposition said Kuczynski only survived the vote by promising 10 lawmakers that he would free Fujimori if they backed him. Kuczynski s government denies the allegations. Fujimori fled Peru for his parent s native Japan as his government imploded in a graft scandal at the turn of the century. He was eventually extradited to Peru and was convicted for leading death squads that massacred civilians. Despite Fujimori s downfall, the rightwing populist movement Fujimori started in the 1990s remains one of the country s most potent political forces. His two adult children, Keiko and Kenji, lead rival factions of the rightwing party, Popular Force, that controls a majority of seats in Congress and pushed to oust Kuczynski this week. Over the past year, Kenji has challenged his sister Keiko s leadership and he has led calls for his release, which could give him a boost if he is freed. TV images showed Kenji, who led the faction that backed Kuczynski, riding in the ambulance that drove Fujimori to the Peruvian-Japanese Centenario Clinic for treatment.  If a (presidential) pardon happens now, it s because there was a pact,  Congresswoman Marisa Glave said on Twitter.  A pardon can t be decided in an under-the-table deal.  Glave is one of about 10 leftist lawmakers who - despite criticizing Kuczynski as a lobbyist - opted not to support the bid to oust him out of fear it would empower Popular Force. Fujimori s well-organized foes were key to Kuczynski s razor-thin victory over Keiko in last year s presidential election, and to keeping Keiko s followers from ousting him this week. Fujimori s supporters dismissed suggestions that his health troubles were a ruse to pave the way for a pardon.  There s no circus,  Luisa Maria Cuculiza, a former ruling party lawmaker during his government, said on local broadcaster RPP. ",worldnews,"December 23, 2017 ",0

Obama lawyers move fast to join fight against Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Johnathan Smith resigned from the U.S. Justice Department on Inauguration Day, he looked forward to spending time with his infant son, but that plan unraveled a week later when President Donald Trump unveiled his explosive foreign travel ban. Within two weeks, Smith had a new job as legal director of civil rights group Muslim Advocates and was drafting briefs for a successful court challenge to the ban, joining other former top Obama administration lawyers now fighting Trump. It is not surprising that Smith and some of his colleagues, political appointees of Democratic President Barack Obama, would leave the Justice Department now led by Republicans. What is unusual is how fast they have signed up to be Trump adversaries. Some Republican lawyers say they were less hasty in moving into oppositional roles post-election. George Terwilliger, a senior Justice Department official under President George H.W. Bush, described the Obama lawyers’ actions as “unprecedented to my memory – and really bad form.” One reason for the Obama lawyers’ quick moves, some of them said, was Trump’s aggressive use of executive authority from day one, which was guaranteed to attract court challenges. Obama faced legal fights over executive power and some of his challengers were formerly lawyers for President George W. Bush, over issues such as immigration and Obamacare. But those came later in Obama’s presidency.  Besides Smith, other lawyers who have jumped into the fray include former Attorney General Eric Holder, who is advising California’s legislature on challenging Trump over immigration, environmental regulations and healthcare; and former acting solicitor general Neal Katyal, who is helping Hawaii contest Trump’s revised travel ban. Influential Manhattan prosecutor Preet Bharara and another 45 Obama-era U.S. attorneys are out of jobs after the Trump administration asked them to resign on Friday. Many of the Obama lawyers keep in touch, but reject the notion, proffered by some Republicans, that Obama is behind resistance efforts. Some of the lawyers credit their rapid transition to Trump’s hardline positions on key issues and to ethical concerns about his presidency and business interests. “There’s a unique threat to our democracy and Constitution that we see in the assault the president is mounting on the Muslim community,” said Smith, who worked on religious discrimination issues at the Justice Department. Norman Eisen, who was Obama’s top ethics lawyer and later ambassador to the Czech Republic, had expected to focus on his work at a think tank after Trump’s election. But instead, he said, “the ethics emergency of constitutional dimensions has galvanized me back into my initial Obama role.”  Eisen is now also chairing Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group he co-founded. The group has already sued Trump over alleged ethics violations. Other Obama appointees taking on Trump include former White House lawyer Ian Bassin who has founded United to Protect Democracy, a new group probing Trump over ethics; and James Cadogan, who worked with Smith at the Justice Department, and is now at the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, a civil rights group already clashing with the new administration. Some career government lawyers, who are not political appointees and normally do not resign in power shifts, have also resigned to oppose Trump. One is Sharon McGowan, who worked on LGBT issues at the Justice Department. On Inauguration Day, she was offered a job as director of strategy at Lambda Legal, an LGBT advocacy group. McGowan said she decided to leave Justice when Trump named Jeff Sessions, a hardline conservative Alabama senator, to be attorney general. That was a “game-changer,” she said. “I knew there would be no chance for me to preserve what I’ve been working on so hard.” ",politicsNews,"March 13, 2017 ",0
"U.S. towns, cities fear taxpayer revolt if Republicans kill deduction","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - From Pataskala, Ohio, to Conroe, Texas, local government leaders worry that if Republican tax-overhaul plans moving through the U.S. Congress become law, it will be harder for them to pave streets, put out fires, fight crime and pay teachers. A tax plan approved by the House of Representatives on Thursday would sharply curtail a federal deduction that millions of Americans can now claim for tax payments to state, county, city and town governments. Ending that deduction, the local leaders say, could make their taxpayers, especially in high-tax communities, less likely to support future local tax increases or even tolerate local taxes at present levels. The proposed repeal of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction is part of an “assault on local governments” by Republicans in Washington, said Elizabeth Kautz, the Republican mayor of Burnsville, Minnesota, near Minneapolis. “My hope is that we look at being thoughtful about what we’re doing and not ram something through just to get something done before the year is out,” Kautz said of the plan being rushed through Congress by her own party. In the United States, local governments run schools, operate police and fire departments and maintain streets, parks and libraries, among other essential services. The federal government’s role at that level is limited. Cities, towns, counties and states collect their own property, sales and income taxes. Under existing law, payments of those taxes can be deducted, or subtracted from federal taxable income, lowering the amount of federal tax due. The House tax bill just approved would eliminate the deduction for individuals and families of state and local income and sales tax, while capping property tax deductions at $10,000. A bill being debated in the Senate, with Republican President Donald Trump’s support, would kill the SALT deduction entirely for individuals and families, although businesses would keep it. The fate of that bill is uncertain. Ending the SALT tax break is part of a package of changes to deductions that would help Republicans raise more than $1.2 trillion in new federal tax revenues over 10 years. That increase would help offset the $1.4 trillion in revenue that would be lost from cutting the corporate tax rate, another part of both the Senate and House plans. Chuck Canterbury, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, which represents 325,000 law enforcement officers nationwide, wrote a letter to congressional leaders on Tuesday. “The FOP is very concerned that the partial or total elimination of SALT deductions will endanger the ability of our state and local government to fund these (law enforcement) agencies,” said the letter, distributed to reporters. Emily Brock, a director at the Government Finance Officers Association, said if SALT deductions were killed by Congress, voters could revolt. “Can you blame an individual taxpayer?” she asked. “They try to minimize their individual tax liability.” Those who want to curb the century-old SALT deduction argue it only motivates local governments to seek more tax increases and spend more money. “Maintaining the deduction encourages government overspending and taxation,” argues the American Legislative Exchange Council, a nonprofit group of conservative state legislators and private activists.  Various other groups are fighting on Capitol Hill to defend the SALT deduction, such as the National Association of Realtors and the U.S. Conference of Mayors. Steve Williams, chief financial officer for Conroe, Texas,  said its rapid growth demanded new fire stations, schools, roads and public safety services. Conroe is near Houston and in the congressional district of Republican Representative Kevin Brady, chairman of the House tax committee and a champion of restricting the SALT deduction. “Tax reform comes with picking winners and losers and I think in the final analysis, the people in (congressional) District 8 will be losers,” Williams said. Conroe is part of Montgomery County, which voted 75 percent to 22.5 percent for Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. In Pataskala, Ohio, near the state capital, Columbus, city finance director Jamie Nicholson said the local police department needed a new station. It now works out of an early 1900s building with no holding cell for suspects who are under arrest. “They get handcuffed to a chair,” he said. Given the past difficulty Pataskala has had convincing taxpayers to approve new taxes, he said, eliminating or paring back the SALT deduction might trigger demands for chopping local taxes and blow a huge hole in his budget. Greg Cox, a Republican member of the San Diego County, California, Board of Supervisors, echoed similar concerns about the impact on his community. He said the Republican plan was unfair partly because it let businesses keep the SALT deduction, while taking it away from individuals and families. ",politicsNews,"November 17, 2017 ",0
Egypt's Sisi says he will not seek a third term: CNBC,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi   will not seek a third term in office, he said in an interview with CNBC, adding that he does not intend to change the constitution and its provision of a two-term presidential limit.  It doesn t suit me as a president to stay one more day against the will of the Egyptians,  he told CNBC over the weekend.  We will not interfere with (the constitution)..I am with preserving two four-year terms,  Sisi added.  However, he did not confirm if he intended to run for a second term when his current term expires. Sisi came to power in 2014, a year after he led the military in ousting elected but unpopular Islamist President Mohamed Mursi. Rights groups say Sisi has since led an unprecedented crackdown on political opponents, activists and critical media. He is unlikely to face strong opposition and many in Egypt see him as vital to stability in a country where unrest since 2011 has battered the economy. Egyptian human rights lawyer and opposition leader Khaled Ali on Monday became the first person to announce he is running against Sisi, vowing to challenge him in the 2018 presidential election, provided he was not barred from the contest. The 45-year-old gained prominence in January, when he won a case that nullified a government transfer of two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia, a deal that had provoked mass protests.

 Former Mexican President Challenges Trump To A Debate – In Mexico,"As Donald Trump continues to attack Mexicans, with his recent comments surrounding the Trump University lawsuit judge, Mexico s former president has one message for the GOP frontrunner: debate me.After chickening out of a debate with Bernie Sanders, Vicente Fox, who served as president of Mexico from 2000 to 2006, challenged the frontrunner to a televised encounter in San Cristobal, Mexico (with a free lunch included). In an interview on Rita Crosby s radio program  Election Central,  Fox said: I m willing to come here, to come here, to the States, if it s for a debate. A direct personal debate with him. Yes, we can use national broadcasting, public broadcasting. With you, we can do that debate. Fox then went on to jab Trump over his $10 million request for a debate, and said that a debate would be focused on ideas and not the overly sensationalist: One condition   that it s done in Mexico   because I need him to see what Mexico is all about, to see what we Mexicans are all about. He will change his attitude toward Mexico    would expect that he would listen to my arguments, that he would put his arguments on the table, but we both are obliged to document, to sustain with facts and numbers what we re saying, and not just lying or cheating to people. So, let s see if Trump will take his first opportunity at being  presidential  and have a cordial, factual conversation with a foreign leader. When he s not busy praising Putin or Jong-un, maybe he can take the time to actually listen to a real leader (one that doesn t rule with an authoritarian fist).But seeing how Trump is a chicken, and doesn t like to engage in a mature manner, the debate with Fox will be as likely as the one with Sanders. And of course Trump wouldn t dare take the bait, because once Fox proves that his people aren t what Trump paints them out to be, there goes his best talking point to his racist supporters.Featured image via Flickr",News,"June 3, 2016",1
OBAMACARE TAKING DOWN MORE RURAL HOSPITALS,"Let s face it Obamacare s been a disaster from Day 1. The closing if rural hospitals is the latest issue and it s a big one for those who ll need to travel farther to get medical help.The AP has noticed something. Rural hospitals seem to be closing. Now, what has happened to the American health care system in recent years that might help explain that? Hmmm .From The AP via ABC (with some honest commentary mixed in): Sac-Osage is one of a growing number of rural U.S. hospitals closing their doors, citing a complex combination of changing demographics, medical practices, management decisions and federal policies that have put more financial pressure on facilities that sometimes average only a few in-patients a day.  Most of the rural hospital closures so far have occurred in the South and Midwest. Of those at risk,nearly 70 percent are in states that have declined to expand Medicaid coverage under the federal Affordable Care Act, although some experts are hesitant to draw a cause-and-effect correlation.At first, the AP tries to blame the closures on the conservative states that decided not to expand medicaid coverage (in spite of Obamacare s explicit instructions), but then admits that this is likely correlation without causation. They don t expound on it, but the obvious reason for the 70% figure is that, generally speaking, the more rural a state is, the more conservative it is, and therefore, the more likely it is to have a governor who opposes Obamacare enough to refrain from expanding medicaid.After all, that was the point (Are you listening, SCOTUS?). Even the AP could see that one a mile a way.Big city hospitals have been closing at about the same rate as rural ones during the past five years, but an abundance of alternatives in most major metropolitan areas typically reduces the effect on patients. When a rural hospital closes, people may have to travel dozens of miles to reach the nearest hospital, an inconvenience that potentially is a matter of life or death.They (briefly) admit that rural hospitals are closing at roughly the same rate as urban hospitals. Isn t this strong evidence that there might be another reason for the closings? What do rural hospitals and urban hospitals have in common? (hint: Obamacare) Declining populations and stagnant economies make it hard on rural hospitals. Rural areas tend to  have older, poorer, sicker populations,  said Michael Topchik, senior vice president of iVantage.That means they often have a higher percentage of patients covered by Medicare and Medicaid, a pair of government health care programs that pay a lower reimbursement rate than private-sector insurers. Hospitals that rely heavily on those government programs have been particularly hard hit by federal budget cuts and provisions in the 2010 federal health care law that reduced charity care reimbursements and changed other payment criteria.Oh this section is pure gold (and, of course, it all appears on page 2). Not only does the AP admit that part of the problem is that the economy is stagnant, they admit that the closings are, in large part, specifically due to the low rates Medicare and Medicaid pay. And to make it worse, they note that the government is reducing the amount of charity care  reimbursements that go to these hospitals.Obamacare is a disaster REPEAL!Via: Poor Richard s",Government News,"May 2, 2015",1
BIG MOUTH ROSIE O’DONNELL Could Be Heading To Prison After Taking Her Hate For President Trump Too Far,"Many are suggesting that the former comedian, turned militant, leftist activist, Rosie O Donnell needs to be treated by federal authorities like every other American when it comes to being held accountable for her actions.

The penalty? For Rosie, she could spend up to 15 years in jail, suffer a lifetime ban from elective office and pay up to a cool $12 million:The statute calls for a fine of  not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value, whichever is greater, or imprisoned for not more than fifteen years, or both, and may be disqualified from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States. In court, O Donnell would probably argue that her attempted bribe was in jest, or perhaps a syndrome of a mental illness.After all, her attorneys would argue, who, while seriously attempting to bribe members of the U.S. Congress would do so in such a reckless, public manner that would all but ensure a conviction?

"Saudi Arabia to host ""expanded"" Syrian opposition conference","DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will host what it called an  expanded  conference for the Syrian opposition this month, aiming to unify its position ahead of United Nations-backed peace talks, the state news agency SPA reported on Monday. Saudi Arabia backs a grouping of opposition figures called the High Negotiations Committee (HNC) led by Riyad Hijab, a former Syrian prime minister under Assad. The HNC has represented the Syrian opposition at previous Geneva talks.  A number of other political opposition groups and figures backed by other countries including Russia and Egypt also exist. It was not clear from SPA s statement which Syrian opposition members would participate in the conference.  The kingdom, a leading backer of Syrian rebels, supports an international agreement on the future of Syria but maintains that President Bashar al-Assad should have no role in any transition to bring the war there to an end. Assad, whose Syrian army forces have been backed by Saudi arch-foes Iran and Hezbollah, has made major gains against opposition forces and Islamic State militants.  Based on the policy of the Kingdom in support of the efforts to establish peace and counter terrorism, and in response to the request of the Syrian opposition, an expanded meeting will be held in the city of Riyadh,  SPA said. Talks set for November 22-24 aim  to bring its parties and platforms closer together and unite its negotiating delegation to resume direct negotiations in Geneva under the auspices of the U.N.  Several rounds of U.N. talks in Geneva between the Damascus government and the opposition have made little progress.  ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",0
 Paul Ryan Takes A Monumentally HUMILIATING Photo With A Constituent Who EXPERTLY Trolled Him (IMAGE),"Politicians are all about photo-ops.

 Red States Think A Bag Of Weed Is More Dangerous Than Illegal Guns,"Some red state Republican legislators are having severe emotional problems over the idea of a person carrying a bag of weed across state lines from Colorado. They seem to think that this is some kind of issue that is going to destroy their state with rampant crime. Oklahoma and Nebraska got so worked up over it, that they tried to force the SCOTUS to shut down Colorado s legal weed industry.The Republican argument is that it s causing crime to  come across state borders.  As a result, they petitioned the SCOTUS to force Colorado to shut down their legalized weed industry citing that marijuana is still illegal under federal law.To call this court case a  layer cake of profound Republican hypocrisy,  would be understating it. Let s run down a couple important points.Republicans are arguing that the supremacy clause of the Constitution means that federal law completely overrules state law, in regards to marijuana legalization. These are the same Republicans who HATE the federal government and insist that federal laws on things like guns should simply be ignored or  nullified  as the confederates like to say. They insist that state s rights are a thing, even in the face of their beloved supremacy clause.Republicans are A-Okay with things like guns flowing from states with weak gun laws into states with higher gun regulation. They do not care about the crime, terror, violence and death these cause because the NRA told them they are not allowed to care. That joint you brought home in your pocket, though, is an outright declaration of war by Colorado apparently.The SCOTUS rejected the case, saying that the states did not try to pursue the avenues available to them in lower courts first. The Department Of Justice said,  Entertaining the type of dispute at issue here   essentially that one state s laws make it more likely that third parties will violate federal and state law in another state   would represent a substantial and unwarranted expansion of this court s original jurisdiction. The likelihood of this case meeting any success on behalf of red states is low at best. The precedent set by some states being allowed to sue to rewrite the laws in other states would be a disaster for the courts, not to mention for Republicans  corporate overlords. The NRA would be in a gasping panic over a state like Illinois or Connecticut suing Virginia over its lax gun laws causing otherwise banned firearms to cross state lines.Featured image via wikicommons",News,"March 21, 2016",1

"Macedonia's parliament adopts 2018 budget, opposition boycotts vote","SKOPJE - Macedonia s parliament has adopted a 2018 draft budget, lowering the deficit to 2.7 percent of national output from 2.9 this year and forecasting growth of 3.2 percent. The budget, totaling 221.7 billion denars ($4.28 billion) and adopted late on Friday, allocated spending equivalent to about 400 million euros ($474.28 million) for capital investment, while average annual inflation was expected to be 1.7 percent. Revenues were forecast at 193.5 billion denars. The main opposition VMRO-DPMNE party boycotted the budget vote in protest at the arrest of a former interior minister, several lawmakers and political activists on charges related to violence in parliament in April, which pushed the nation into a political crisis. Macedonia s central bank revised its economic growth forecast for 2017 down to 0.5 percent from 2.5 percent, citing a poor economic performance in the first half of the year because of political instability. Macedonia s two-year crisis over a wiretapping scandal that toppled the government of nationalist Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, ended in June with the appointment of a pro-Western government of the Social Democrat Prime Minister Zoran Zaev. Finance Minister Dragan Tevdovski told parliament that the government planned to finance the deficit through a combination of domestic and foreign loans.   The borrowing abroad may be done through a Eurobond or favorable foreign loans,  Tevdovski said. The economy of the landlocked Balkan country grew by 2.4 percent in 2016 but national output contracted 1.9 percent in the second quarter of 2017, the first decline since 2012.  Macedonia, which won independence from former Yugoslavia in 1991, has made little progress towards membership of the European Union and the NATO alliance due to a name dispute with Greece.

Immigration chaos and long nights led to Washington's court win,"SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson arrived in Seattle last Saturday after a trip to Florida, public outrage over the immigration order issued the previous day by President Donald Trump was quickly growing. He went home, greeted his family and then went to work.  By late Monday afternoon, just minutes before the court closed for the day, Ferguson, a Democrat, and his team of lawyers were ready to file the first state lawsuit seeking to block the order. On Friday, they won a dramatic courtroom victory when U.S. District Judge James Robart put on hold the travel ban for refugees and citizens of seven mainly Muslim countries. The lawsuit emerged out of a chaotic 48-hour period in which the need for immediate action held sway over the kind of carefully thought-out strategizing that usually leads up to a major legal complaint being filed, according to Ferguson and other attorneys involved in actions against the order. “We knew we had one shot,” Ferguson said in an interview, in reference to the bid for a temporary restraining that would immediately overturn Trump’s executive order. The lawsuit is one of several now filed against the executive order around the United States, but it was the first case leading to a broad decision that applies nationwide.  The fight over the immigration order is just the first of what is likely to be a series of court battles between Democratic attorneys general, the top legal officers in liberal-leaning states, and the administration. Several attorneys general have already said they expect to sue Trump on various issues if he oversteps his authority, including on the environment and consumer protection. President Trump on Saturday ridiculed Judge Robart, a George W. Bush appointee, and his decision. The Justice Department filed a formal appeal. The Washington state lawyers worked around the clock last Saturday and Sunday against the backdrop of turbulent scenes at U.S. airports, where immigrants were detained by federal officials unprepared to implement the president’s directive. There was little time to coordinate with other states, though ultimately one other state, Minnesota, joined the effort. Additional states, including Virginia, New York and Hawaii, have filed their own lawsuits or sought to intervene in cases brought by individuals affected by the ban. State attorneys general did not collectively decide to let Washington file first for any strategic advantage, Ferguson said. Rather, Washington was able most quickly to marshal evidence of the harm Trump’s order caused to the state, which is crucial to establish legal standing.  Ferguson called the general counsels at major Washington employers Amazon.com Inc. and Expedia Inc. for their support. The companies eventually filed sworn statements in court saying the ban hurt their businesses.     The state lawyers also gathered information on the harm to state residents and institutions such as the university system, which the judge appeared to find persuasive. The legal assault on the order has involved Ferguson and other Democratic lawyers taking a leaf from the play-book followed by Republican states that successfully challenged actions taken by Trump’s predecessor, former President Barack Obama. Washington state’s claims rely in part on the same legal arguments that Texas and 25 other Republican-led states made when they challenged Obama’s November 2014 plan to protect up to four million immigrants from deportation. In that case, the Republican states argued that Obama overstepped his constitutional powers by infringing upon the authority of Congress.  Washington and other states say Trump has violated the Constitution too, albeit on different grounds. They say he has violated protections against discrimination on the basis of religion by targeting Muslims. The state has a responsibility to protect the “health, safety, and well-being” of all its residents, the lawsuit said. In the 2014 case, Texas, like Washington state in the Trump case, asked for a nationwide injunction.  Where the fight against Trump’s order differs from the Texas challenge to Obama is that various lawsuits have been filed around the country by states and civil rights groups. The Texas case was a single lawsuit that the other states joined. ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt said there was little time to talk strategy among the many states and advocacy groups opposing the order, as would normally happen. “It’s moving too quickly,” he said. That sense of urgency was all too clear to Washington state lawyers on Monday as they feverishly gathered the required documents to file with the lawsuit, including the motion for a temporary restraining order. Unlike other court papers filed electronically, a paper copy of that motion had to be delivered to the clerk’s office in person. So Noah Purcell, the solicitor general, led a race to the Seattle courthouse with others from the office just as the building was about to close. They pulled up to the courthouse, jumped out of the car and ran up the steps to the doors before they were locked. They arrived just in time. ",politicsNews,"February 5, 2017 ",0
HOLY CASH COW! Check Out How Much Wall Street Funneled Into HILLARY’s Foundation/Slush Fund,"Thank God she has a vagina, otherwise her blatant hypocrisy might be an issue with voters Hillary Clinton is facing more questions about her close ties to Wall Street financial institutions. Last week, the New York Times urged Clinton to release transcripts of her highly-compensated speeches to Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs.The paid speeches are just a slim chapter of her relationship with financial titans. According to Clinton Foundation records, Wall Street financial institutions have donated around $40 million to the eponymous family foundation.As a non-profit, the Clinton Foundation isn t legally required to disclose its donors or contributions. The Foundation has publicly disclosed some contributions on its website. It only provides ranges for contributions, e.g. $1-5 million, and doesn t detail when the contribution was made or for what purpose, if any.Here s the chart of contributions from Wall Street to the Clinton Foundation.All together, contributions from readily identifiable Wall Street institutions to the Foundation total somewhere between $11 million and $41 million in contributions. If we assume the donations fall in the middle of the ranges disclosed by the Clinton Foundation, the contributions would total just under $30 million.As with most things involving the Clintons, the devil is in the details. This total of contributions does not include those made by individuals with strong Wall Street ties. It also does not necessarily represent the total amounts contributed to the Foundation from those donors listed. It only accounts for the donations which the Foundation has chosen to disclose.The failure of the Foundation to include any information on the timing of the donations is especially worrisome. In terms of donor relationships, there is a real difference between a one-time gift of $1 million and an ongoing gift of $200,000 for 5 straight years. The total dollar amount may be the same, but an ongoing gift usually requires a more substantive relationship between the Foundation and the donor.There is, of course, an added dimension to the timing issue with the Clintons. During the life of the Foundation, Hillary Clinton has been a US Senator, Secretary of State and two-time candidate for President.When the Clinton Foundation discloses that the  Friends of Saudi Arabia  contributed $1-5 million, it begs the obvious question of when that donation was made. The specific date of that donation is particularly important, given Clinton s considerable focus on the Middle East while she was Secretary of State.It is also important to note that these contributions are completely seperate from the paid speeches made by Bill and Hillary Clinton. In 2013 alone, Hillary earned just over $3 million in paid speeches to financial firms and institutions.These contributions, obviously, also don t include direct contributions made by Wall Street institutions and individuals to either of Clinton s Presidential campaigns.For entire story: Breitbart News",left-news,"Mar 1, 2016",1

Ukrainian judge frees Saakashvili from detention,"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian opposition figure Mikheil Saakashvili was freed from detention on Monday, after a Ukrainian judge turned down the prosecutors  request to place him under house arrest - the latest twist in his dramatic standoff with the authorities.  President of his native Georgia for nine years until 2013, Saakashvili moved to Ukraine after a popular uprising there and served under Poroshenko as a regional governor from 2015-2016, before falling out with the Ukrainian leader. The 49-year-old accuses the Ukrainian authorities of widespread corruption. Prosecutors wanted him placed under house arrest while investigators look into accusations he assisted a criminal organization, charges he says were trumped up to undermine his campaign to unseat Poroshenko.  The prosecutors  petition ... is dismissed,  Judge Larysa Tsokol told the court. A crowd of several hundred supporters, who had remained outside the courthouse throughout the eight-hour hearing, cheered the judge s decision.  The judge is good. She did everything correctly and in accordance with the law,  Saakashvili  said.  It means not everything is lost in Ukraine.  The case against him remains open. Speaking after the ruling, which was attended by several prominent opposition lawmakers, including former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, Saakashvili said he planned to continue his political work. Together with other opposition politicians he will  prepare for a peaceful but very important and necessary change in leadership in Ukraine , he said.  Saakashvili, who launched a hunger strike to protest against his detention, sang the Ukrainian national anthem at the beginning of the hearing. The courtroom was so packed with journalists and Saakashvili s supporters that his lawyer asked the judge to move the session to a larger room. The investigation provoked violent clashes between protesters and riot police last week, while on Sunday several thousand people attended a peaceful rally in central Kiev to support Saakashvili and call for Poroshenko s impeachment.  While the protest does not represent a significant risk to government stability at the moment, it will likely attract the attention of Ukraine s international supporters and donors,  London-based research firm Teneo Intelligence said in a note.  Saakashvili is also facing the threat of possible extradition to Georgia, where he is wanted on criminal charges. Justice Minister Pavlo Petrenko told Reuters the extradition request was being considered but no final decision had yet been made. He denied the case was politically motivated.  Every person who lives in Ukraine must respect the basic laws,  he said.   Unfortunately so far we only see things that are unworthy behavior of such a person.  ",worldnews,"December 11, 2017 ",0
"Factbox: Many pieces to tax reform puzzle for Trump, U.S. Congress","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, fresh from their failed push to repeal Obamacare, are now tackling a project that has eluded Washington for 30 years - tax reform. Tax staffers are meeting in the House of Representatives and the Senate through the August break to work on legislation that is expected to be unveiled next month. Some analysts are skeptical that the fractious Republicans are up to comprehensive tax reform, even though the party controls both chambers, and say Republican may have to settle for a handful of tax cuts. Here are some of the key tax issues ahead. Americans pay a top individual tax rate of 39.6 percent. Trump wants to cut that top rate to 35 percent; House Republican leaders have proposed cutting it to 33 percent. In proposals to simplify taxes, Trump wants to shrink the number of tax brackets to three from seven and double the standard deduction, a set level of income exempt from tax. The latter move, analysts say, would sharply reduce the number of taxpayers who can claim certain narrower deductions, such as the ones for mortgage interest and charitable donations. Trump has also promised, without providing much detail, more help for families with child and dependent care expenses and to eliminate targeted tax breaks that benefit wealthy people. In two proposals that would help mainly high-income and wealthy taxpayers, Trump and congressional Republicans want to repeal the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax. The estate tax, which Republicans call the “death tax,” is a tax on the assets left to heirs by people when they die. It is paid by very few Americans because it currently applies only to inheritances exceeding $5.49 million per person. The alternative minimum tax is a way to make sure that mostly high-earners who have many deductions pay some taxes. An effort by Trump and congressional Republicans to repeal former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act and the taxes that support it failed in July. Those taxes, including a 3.8-percent surtax on investment income and a 0.9-percent payroll tax to support the Medicare healthcare program for the elderly, remain on the books for now.  Americans can deduct taxes paid to state and local governments from their federal tax bills. Trump and House Republican leaders want to end this. The proposal would most hurt states where Democrats dominate because those states tend to charge higher state and local taxes and provide more government services, with the result that their residents take larger federal deductions. But the proposal is opposed by at least 20 House Republicans, reducing its chances of enactment. Tax deductions for interest paid on mortgages and donations to charities are probably safe. Trump has promised to protect them. Yet, there has been discussion of lowering the cap on the mortgage interest deduction to $500,000 from $1 million. Analysts say that would generate enough revenue to cut the corporate tax rate by three percentage points, but such a move would pit upper-middle class and wealthy homeowners against multinational corporations.   Lobbyists for real estate businesses and philanthropies say  that, if the standard deduction doubled, fewer taxpayers would be able to claim the mortgage interest and charitable giving deductions. That could undermine home-buying and donations to philanthropies, they say. Corporations pay 35 percent of their profits in taxes, at least on paper. Trump wants to slash that to 15 percent; House Republicans want 20 percent; some lawmakers say 25 percent might be achievable. No consensus on the rate has been reached. PASS-THROUGH BUSINESSES Trump wants a special, low tax rate for “pass-through” businesses, which are private companies that pass their profits through to owners as income that is taxed at the individual rate. Most U.S. businesses are pass-throughs and range from family-run shops to large businesses. The idea of a special tax rate for them raises the prospect of a new wave of tax avoidance schemes with wage earners funneling income into “pass-through” structures. Under Republicans’ plans, about $2.6 trillion in corporate profits now parked abroad would be repatriated, or brought into the United States, and taxed at 3.5 percent to 8.75 percent payable over eight years. That rate would be way below the 35 percent tax that is owed now on those profits, but that is payable only if they enter the country. Republicans also want to change the corporate income tax so companies are no longer taxed on foreign profits by adopting a so-called “territorial” system, replacing the “worldwide” system in which U.S. companies are taxed on profits globally. The U.S. tax code allows corporations to defer tax payments on foreign profits held overseas. Corporations have been stockpiling profits abroad to avoid paying the 35 percent U.S. corporate rate, which under current law they would owe when the money is returned to U.S. soil. A House Republican “border adjustment” tax proposal meant to discourage imports and encourage exports has been dropped. Tax cuts generally reduce federal revenue and raise the budget deficit. The deficit is estimated in fiscal 2017 to hit $693 billion, or 3.6 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), up from 3.1 percent in 2016. With that in mind, Republican deficit hawks could make it hard for Trump to push through any deficit-expanding tax measures. Some Republicans want Congress’s nonpartisan, professional tax and budget analysts to make more use of “dynamic scoring” in estimating the impact of tax changes on the budget. The approach tends to assume an increased economic stimulus effect from tax cuts, resulting in smaller projected increases to the deficit. ",politicsNews,"August 10, 2017 ",0
 Lewandowski To Fox News: Apologizing To The Reporter I Assaulted Is ‘Unrealistic’,"Corey Lewandowski got some good news last week when the state s attorney for Palm Beach, Florida announced that he was dropping the charges against him and is now saying he is ready to move on. But don t expect Trump s abusive campaign manager to admit he did something wrong or apologize for it.Lewandowski appeared on Fox News Sunday, and Chris Wallace asked if he had any intention of apologizing to Michelle Fields: In the interest of avoiding unnecessary litigation, which I know Republicans don t like, are you prepared here and now to apologize to Ms. Fields for touching her and for saying that she was delusioned? The campaign manager responded exactly the way you d expect Trump s right-hand man to respond: Here and now I d like to say I ve never spoken to Ms. Fields. I turned over my phone records to the Palm Beach County district attorney s office. It clearly shows I called her phone number that evening [after] I read about this on the Twitter feed. I d be happy to have a conversation with her. But to apologize to somebody I ve never spoken to and candidly don t remember ever having any interaction with is something that is a little unrealistic right now. He added,  This is a person I ve never spoken to and I d be happy to have that conversation if we can put this thing behind us. Just like his boss, Lewandowski is incapable of admitting that he was wrong. He still refuses to apologize to the woman he assaulted and called names even though there is video evidence proving he did it. He, like Trump, thinks that he can just walk through life and do whatever he wants without ever suffering any consequences and unfortunately, Palm Beach prosecutors reaffirmed this by not pursuing the charges.Ms. Fields has likely had her career ruined, while this jackass gets to proceed as if nothing happened.

$110K STOLEN FROM ‘At Risk Kids’ Fund By DC City Council To Fund Obama’s Inaugural Ball,"Aren t the kids already suffering enough by being forced to eat Mooch s slop for lunch? Isn t it always  all about the kids  for the unions and Dem s? When the Washington D.C. City Council pleaded for $110,000 in funding for a program for at risk kids they cried that it was  for the children.  But not long after the money was given to the city, officials decided to use it to fund a big party for Obama s 2009 inaugural. Now one official has been sentenced for this theft.Former DC official Neil S. Rodgers was sentenced this week for the theft and six others have pled guilty in separate cases for the misappropriation of the funding.Neil S. Rodgers, a former D.C. government official, was sentenced Tuesday for his role in the misappropriation of $110,000 earmarked for D.C. s Children at Risk and Drug Prevention Fund to cover a deficit for the 51st State Inaugural Ball for President Obama s inauguration in 2009. Rodgers, found guilty of fraud in March, was sentenced to 36 days (served on weekends) plus two years of probation. Rodgers must also repay the entire $110,000 as restitution for his crime. In 2008, as arrangements were underway for inauguration celebrations, the Washington City Paper reported on former council member Harry Thomas Jr. s early plans for the 51st State Inaugural Ball, noting that  there would have to be a plan to raise funds for the event, and security and cleanup concerns would also have to dealt with. Thomas says all that will be taken care of; he says he plans to seek private donations to cover the difference between the event s cost and the revenues raised by the $51 ticket cost.  Donations, however, came up short. Justice Department officials described Rodgers s role in the misappropriation scheme in a Tuesday press release.Via: Right Wing News",politics,"Jun 18, 2015",1

Nancy s even more bizarre than usual behavior has led a lot of Americans to question her mental capacity and wonder if she s one of the members who s receiving the medications to treat  serious health problems ?Something is clearly wrong with Nancy Pelosi. Why is everyone in Washington DC and in the media ignoring her bizarre and incoherent interviews that leave viewers wondering how in the world she is fit to serve. American Mirror   During her recent weekly press conference, the House Minority Leader was seen stumbling over words, uttering gibberish, staring blankly at reporters, and on at least two occasions, suffering from face spasms. What an event-filled morning has been,  Pelosi began, botching her opening line.It went downhill from there. Really one that, uh, marks a transf  for  she said, before staring at reporters barely 10 seconds into the appearance, and finally saying,  transformative moment Moments later, she confused  trillions  and  billions. When President Bush left office the deficit was 1.4 trillion,  she said as she suffered an apparent facial spasm,  uh, trillion dollars. So you re talking about an enormous amount of money. The national debt increased by an enormous amount   the debt was 1.4 billion in terms of the deficit. Watch her incoherent interview here:A Washington D.C. pharmacy revealed on Wednesday that they deliver medications that treat  serious health problems  to members of Congress, including medications to treat Alzheimer s disease.Pharmacy owner, Dr. Mike Kim, said that he has  gotten used to  knowing highly sensitive information about some of the most powerful people in Washington, STAT reported. At first it s cool, and then you realize, I m filling some drugs that are for some pretty serious health problems as well. And these are the people that are running the country,  Kim said, listing treatments for conditions like diabetes and Alzheimer s.Kim expressed concern over some of the serious health problems that members of Congress have because the diseases could severely limit their ability to serve in their elected positions. It makes you kind of sit back and say,  Wow, they re making the highest laws of the land and they might not even remember what happened yesterday.   Daily Wire ",politics,"Oct 27, 2017",1
U.S waives Jones Act to secure fuel for hurricane responders,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Friday said it was temporarily waiving a law that limits the availability of cargoes on the U.S. coasts, a step that will ensure enough fuel reaches emergency responders during Hurricane Irma and in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.  The Jones Act mandates the use of U.S.-flagged vessels to transport merchandise between U.S. coasts. The Department of Homeland Security waived the requirement for one week. This will allow oil and gas operators to use often cheaper, tax-free, or more readily available foreign-flagged vessels. Harvey, which hit Texas with record floods, had a wider effect of disrupting fuel distribution across Florida, Georgia and other Southeastern states by shutting refineries and pipelines.  With Hurricane Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in a century, expected to hit Florida in days, the region will experience “one of the largest mass evacuations in American history” and see historic levels of restoration and response crews, said Elaine Duke, acting secretary of Homeland Security. Waiving the Jones Act will ensure there is fuel to support lifesaving efforts and restore services and infrastructure in the wake of the storm, Duke said.  ",politicsNews,"September 8, 2017 ",0

FBI interviews Hillary Clinton in private server probe,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for three and a half hours on Saturday as part of the probe into her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state, her campaign said. The interview at FBI headquarters in Washington followed a week of intense public focus on the investigation and on  Clinton’s viability as a presidential candidate, with four months to go to the election. Her campaign has tried for months to downplay the controversy as a distraction.   In an interview broadcast on MSNBC, Clinton said she was happy to do the FBI interview, which her spokesman earlier described as “voluntary.”  “I’ve been answering questions for over a year” regarding the private email server, Clinton said. It was not clear if the questioning of Clinton signaled an imminent conclusion to the investigation in a pivotal time for the presidential race. It does follow FBI interviews of several of Clinton’s former staff members, as well as her top aide Huma Abedin.  Clinton is expected to be formally nominated as the Democratic candidate for the Nov. 8 presidential election at the party’s convention in less than four weeks.  “Timing of FBI interview, between primaries and convention, probably good timing for @HillaryClinton,” tweeted David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama who served as the chief strategist for his two presidential campaigns. “Best to get it behind her.” Clinton is currently the front-runner for the White House with polls showing her leading presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. In a tweet on Saturday, Trump said it was “impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong!”   He also criticized Clinton’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, for meeting privately with Attorney General Loretta Lynch earlier this week, which Lynch later said she regretted, though she said they did not discuss the investigation.  “What Bill did was stupid!” Trump tweeted. The FBI is investigating whether anyone in Clinton’s operation broke the law as result of a personal email server kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. One of the questions is whether they mishandled classified information on the server.   Clinton and her staff have struggled to respond to accusations that her use of the server in violation of State Department protocol means she is untrustworthy. Trump has said the investigation should disqualify her from being president. “@HillaryClinton campaign statement says She “voluntarily” met w @FBI for 3.5 hours this morning - yeah, lots of people volunteer 2 do that,” tweeted the Republican National Committee’s communications director, Sean Spicer. FBI Director James Comey said in testimony to Congress in March he felt pressure to complete the investigation quickly. Adding to the uncertainty over Clinton is the FBI’s refusal to say who is the target of its investigation. Republican lawmakers have called for an independent investigation, saying they do not trust the Justice Department to handle the inquiry with impartiality. Republicans, including Trump, intensified their criticism of the process on Thursday after news emerged of Lynch’s meeting with Bill Clinton.  Lynch said she would accept whatever recommendations the career prosecutors working on the case made about whether to prosecute Clinton. The FBI probe and the partisan fight over the server have added an extra layer of uncertainty to one of the most tumultuous presidential races in recent memory. Trump, a political novice once dismissed by the Republican establishment, will likely emerge this month as the party’s nominee and has set his sights on Clinton, who he has labeled “Crooked Hillary.”  Clinton held a nine-point lead over Trump in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday.

"May Brexit offer would hurt, cost EU citizens - EU parliament","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May s offer of  settled status  for EU residents is flawed and will leave them with fewer rights after Brexit, the European Parliament s Brexit coordinator said on Tuesday. A family of five could face a bill of 360 pounds to acquire the new status, Guy Verhofstadt told May s Brexit Secretary David Davis in a letter seen by Reuters    a very significant amount for a family on low income . Listing three other concerns for the EU legislature, which must approve any treaty on the March 2019 exit, Verhofstadt told Davis:  Under your proposals, EU citizens will definitely notice a deterioration of their status as a result of Brexit. And the Parliament s aim all along has been that EU citizens, and UK citizens in the EU-27, should notice no difference.  Verhofstadt, a former Belgian prime minister, wrote in response to Davis, who had written to him after Parliament complained last week that there remained  major issues  to be settled on the rights of the 3 million EU citizens in Britain. On Tuesday, he told reporters that Parliament was determined that expatriates should not become  victims of Brexit . May had unveiled more details last week of a system aimed at giving people already in Britain a quick and cheap way of asserting their rights to stay there indefinitely. The issue, along with how much Britain owes and the new EU-UK border across Ireland, is one on which the EU wants an outline agreement before opening talks on the future of trade. Verhofstadt said lawmakers were not dismissing British efforts to streamline applications but saw flaws in the nature of  settled status  itself. As well as the cost, which is similar to that of acquiring a British passport, he cited three others: - Europeans should simply  declare  a whole household resident, without needing an  application  process; the burden of proof should be on the British authorities to deny them rights. - more stringent conditions on criminal records could mean some EU residents, including some now with permanent resident status, being deported for failing to gain  settled status . - EU residents would lose some rights to bring relatives to Britain as the new status would give them the same rights as British people, who now have fewer rights than EU citizens.

" Finally, Somebody Is Getting ARRESTED For Lead Poisoning In Flint’s Water","Criminal charges are coming down the line for Flint, Michigan officials involved in the devastating lead poisoning of the city s water supply. The Detroit Free Press reports that the state attorney general is about to make a major move.Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette will announce criminal charges today in connection with his ongoing investigation of the Flint drinking water crisis, three sources familiar with the investigation told the Free Press on Tuesday.Officials believe the city got artificially low lead readings because they didn t test the homes most at risk   those with lead service lines or other features putting them at high risk for lead. Among those to be charged is a City of Flint official who signed a document saying the homes Flint used to test tap water under the federal Lead and Copper Rule all had lead service lines   a statement investigators allege was false.Flint   a majority black city of over 100,000   had its water poisoned when an emergency manager put in place by Republican Governor Rick Snyder made the decision to switch the city s water supply to the Flint River in order to save money. Thanks to a system of corroded pipes, the water was poisoned with lead and piped into homes as drinking water.As a result, tests of Flint children have shown an increase in blood lead levels from 2.5% of kids to possibly as much as 5%. Lead poisoning can cause many physical ailments as it attacks the body, as well as brain damage resulting in serious learning disabilities and other disorders.Governor Snyder and his subordinates first down played concerns about lead poisoning when Flint residents began complaining about the quality of their water. Then as national media outlets began covering the issue, Snyder hired crisis managers and began to issue apologies while failing to seriously take blame for his decision.Now someone is going to be arrested, but it is an open question if the investigation will go to an even higher level, to the decision makers at top.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 20, 2016",1

 WATCH: Rachel Maddow Just Skillfully Exposed Trump’s ‘Deliberate’ Attempts To Spark A Race War (VIDEO),"On Friday, Donald Trump canceled a rally in Chicago because he was embarrassed that seemingly more people showed up to protest him than to stroke his ego. The night had already been bloody, with an event in St. Louis, Missouri almost becoming a total race war earlier in the evening. In Chicago, Trump has not even arrived when the incredibly white attendees began attacking, hurling insults at, and geerally being complete racist d*ckbags to black people and anyone else who dissented   just like Trump taught them to (after all, he says he will pay their legal fees if they brutalize a black man in his name).The Donald says he was forced to cancel his rally because he didn t want anyone to  get hurt    though he was perfectly willing to call into Fox News to whine about how somehow his First Amendment rights had been stripped away by protesters, once again proving that not a single Republican anywhere understands the First Amendment. According to the billionaire 2016 hopeful, the blame for violence at his rallies lies with two entities: the protesters his fans attack, and Barack Obama.Shortly after, Rachel Maddow took a moment out of her show to absolutely and utterly destroy any claim Trump could make that he doesn t want violence at his rallies, that he just wants people to be safe as he claims. It s becoming more intense at Donald Trump rallies,  Maddow said after playing a clip of the numerous beatings we have seen at his campaign events throughout recent history: There have been instances in the past where he has encouraged or at least praised the idea of violent actions by his supporters, when he s spoken wistfully about how great it would be to beat people up at his rallies, or he s told people that he would pay their legal fees if they beat up a protester on his behalf. But this sort of bloodlust, this kind of half-tongue-in-cheek-mostly-serious call for a  tougher America  where there are more beatings, and where anti-Trump protesters should fear for their lives as he heads into these tinderbox cities today and tonight, I just want you to watch how that part of candidate Donald Trump s rhetoric has escalated. Maddow rolled numerous clips of Trump calling for his violent, racist, and  poorly educated  fans to harm others   with date stamps included. In other words, she left Trump in a completely indefensible position, not that it matters to him or his followers.  If you want to see the deliberate act that created what happened tonight in Chicago, watch where it came from,  she said, noting that all the calls for violence culminated into the Chicago incident. And it really is something like we have never seen in mainstream American politics before,  Maddow told viewers, recalling that she used to see these events unfold at white supremacist rallies in the 1980 s. The difference, of course, is that it is now happening in mainstream Republican politics at events hosted by their frontrunner. Anybody who tells you that there s no connection between the behavior of the mob at these events and the behavior of the man leading the mob at these events is not paying attention to what he s saying at the podium,  she said after the clips rolled. but the most damning clip she rolled was of Trump in St. Louis earlier that evening when he complained that  part of the problem is no body wants to hurt each other anymore. That s right   he complained that there was not enough violence at his events to put protesters in their place.  There used to be consequences,  he whined just before St. Louis erupted into violence.  These people are bringing us down,  he whined.  These are the people that are destroying our country. That s the way Donald Trump has been talking about protesters at his events. That s the way he has been directing his supporters at events. That was today,  Maddow said after the damning St. Louis footage rolled.  If you want to know what led up to Chicago tonight that was Donald Trump s display of leadership and calming the waters.  Then she dropped the bomb: American presidential politics isn t like this for anyone else. American presidential politics did not get this way on its own. This is the workd of an American presidential candidate who deliberately made this happen. And the Republican party is about to nominate him for President.

Facebook pushes ad overhaul before 2018 U.S. election: executive,"SAN JOSE, Calif. (Reuters) - Facebook Inc has begun overhauling how it handles political ads on its platform and may put some changes in place before U.S. elections next year, Facebook’s chief technology officer said on Wednesday.  U.S. congressional and state elections set for November 2018 present a deadline of sorts for Facebook and other social media companies to get better at halting the kind of election meddling that the United States accuses Russia of. “We are working on all of this stuff actively now, so there is a big focus in the company to improve all of this on a regular basis,” Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer said in an interview.  “You’re going to see a regular cadence of updates and changes,” he said, speaking on the sidelines of a conference that Facebook is hosting about virtual reality technology.  Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said last month that the company would begin treating political ads differently from other ads, including by making it possible for anyone to see political ads, no matter whom they target. U.S. lawmakers had begun calling for regulations.  Disclosures by Facebook, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google that their products were battlegrounds for Russian election meddling last year have turned into a crisis for Silicon Valley. Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, is in Washington this week meeting U.S. lawmakers.  Moscow has denied allegations of meddling in last year’s U.S. presidential election.  Implementing changes is tricky, Schroepfer said, because Facebook does not want to stifle legitimate speech and because of the volume of material on Facebook, the world’s largest social network with 2 billion users and 5 million advertisers.  “We’re investing very heavily in technical solutions, because we’re operating at an unprecedented scale,” he said.  Facebook is also using humans. The company said this month it would hire 1,000 more people to review ads and ensure they meet its terms. Schroepfer, 42, has been Facebook’s CTO since 2013 and previously was director of engineering. He also sits on Facebook’s board of directors.  Facebook has dealt with problematic user-generated content in the past, he said.  “We don’t want misuse of the platform, whether that’s a foreign government trying to intercede in a democracy - that’s obviously not OK - or whether it’s an individual spewing hate or uploading pornography,” he said.

CHICAGO THUGS Watched 9 Yr Old Play On Swings Before Carrying Out His Brutal Murder In Retaliation Against Dad’s Gang,"UPDATE: No #BlackLivesMatter Protests PlannedChicago has no shortage of thugs.

You don t hear our Community Organizer In Chief running to a microphone every time a young black man or woman is murdered at the hands of another black man or woman. Sadly, it doesn t fit their narrative. This young boy s murder is far more tragic than the plight of the Muslim boy, with a history of discipline issues, who took a fake bomb to school in Texas on 9-11 and was rightly punished for his behavior by school officials. The phony outrage that Obama showed the world over this little fake  clock boy s  arrest should sicken every American. It is especially disturbing when one considers Obama s deafening silence over the horrific gang violence that plagues his hometown of Chicago. Where were the tweets of outrage from the White House over the loss of this beautiful young boy s life? Crickets On Friday, prosecutors laid out their case against a man accused of murdering 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee on Nov. 2Corey Morgan, 27, of suburban Lansing, was charged in the murder. Police have one other man in custody who has not yet been charged, and a third man, Kevin Edwards, is also wanted in the slaying.Prosecutors say Corey Morgan (left) and Kevin Edwards planned the heinous murder of 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee.Assistant State s Attorney George Canellis said Friday the shooting stemmed from an ongoing feud between Morgan s gang, the BBG (Bang Bang Gang)/Terror Dome faction of the Black P Stones and the Killaward faction of the Gangster Disciples.The feud came to a boil after an Oct. 13 shooting in which Morgan s brother, Tracey Morgan was killed and his mother was wounded. Morgan was so enraged he threatened to shoot  grandmas, mamas, kids and all  in retaliation, prosecutors said.Tyshawn was hit in his back, forearm and head, and part of his thumb was shot off as if he was raising his hand to block the shots, Canellis said. This murder was committed in a cold, calculated and premeditated manner,  Canellis said.Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy vowed to destroy the group responsible for the boy s brutal murder. They are going to be obliterated,  he said.  That gang just signed its death warrant. McCarthy did not detail each suspect s role in the shooting. We know that there were three individuals involved in this,  he said.Morgan s arrest comes nearly a month after Tyshawn s Nov. 2 shooting death.Police are hunting for Kevin Edwards, also suspected in the shooting.Court documents paint a disturbing picture of the planned attack, explaining that Morgan and his accomplices allegedly saw Tyshawn playing on the swings in a playlot with his basketball beside him. One of the suspects allegedly started dribbling Tyshawn s ball, ultimately luring him into the alley where police say he was  executed.

Trump budget on the menu as U.S. senators lunch with Tillerson,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee will meet with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to discuss the administration’s proposed budget, the panel’s chairman said on Wednesday, after heated opposition in Congress to President Donald Trump’s plan to slash funding for diplomacy and foreign aid. “I’ve let Secretary Tillerson know there’s a lot of concern about the budget issue,” Senator Bob Corker, the committee’s Republican chairman, said at a hearing on the global humanitarian crisis. Members of the Senate panel will have lunch with Tillerson at the State Department on Thursday, he said. Corker also made clear that when Congress takes up agriculture-related legislation next year he would push to reform current rules for distributing U.S. food aid, which make it more expensive and time-consuming to provide assistance after international crises. “We could feed 4 to 6 million more people each year,” he said, saying some interest groups pushing to keep current rules are “extorting us.” Yves Daccord, director-general of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, South Sudan, northeastern Nigeria and Somalia, plus Ethiopia and Kenya, may be among the worst in recent history. “We’re talking about 20 million directly affected, plus ... several other dozen millions possibly affected,” Daccord told the hearing. The ICRC said on Wednesday the world has just a few months to save millions in Yemen and Somalia from starvation, as war and drought ruin crops and block deliveries of food and medical care. Many of Trump’s fellow Republicans, as well as Democrats, objected to his first budget outline last week, which boosted military spending and cut international programs by 28 percent. They said humanitarian assistance and diplomacy are at least as important to security as weapons. “It’s essential that we maintain our international affairs budget, from this senator’s perspective,” Republican Senator Todd Young told the hearing.  The budget as presented by Trump is unlikely to pass. Congress, not the White House, determines government spending.  Corker told reporters on Tuesday that he supported efforts to make State Department programs more efficient, but wanted a more thorough review of various programs. “I think every department of government should be looked at continuously, and so I’m all for us looking into that,” Corker said. “But I would like to walk through some of the areas that he (Tillerson) feels he wants to stress and obviously Congress ultimately will have the say (on the budget).” ",politicsNews,"March 22, 2017 ",0
Iran sees little chance of enemy attack: military chief,"DUBAI (Reuters) - - Enemies are unlikely to attack Iran, especially on the ground, the country s military chief predicted on Saturday, saying even  unwise  leaders in the West know that any such conflict would have huge costs for them. U.S. President Donald Trump, adopting an aggressive posture towards Iran after its test launch of a ballistic missile, said in February that  nothing is off the table  in dealing with Tehran, and the White House said it was putting Iran  on notice .   In the remote case of an aggression (by enemies), this won t be on the ground because they would face brave warriors,  Iran s semi-official news agency Tasnim quoted military chief of staff General Mohammad Baqeri as saying.  Thank God, even the unwise who lead world arrogance (the West)... can conclude that attacking the Islamic Republic would entail heavy costs,  Baqeri said at an air defense exhibition.  Even if they would control the start of an aggression, they would not have a say about its end and they won t even be able to limit the war to Iran s borders,  Baqeri added. The United States imposed unilateral sanctions against Iran last month after saying the ballistic missile tests violated a U.N. resolution, which endorsed a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers to lift sanctions. The resolution called upon Tehran not to undertake activities related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such technology. It stopped short of explicitly barring such activity. Iran denies its missile development breaches the resolution, saying its missiles are not designed to carry nuclear weapons.

 Anti-Abortion Laws Collapse In Major Defeat For The Right,"The religious right s attempt to stop women from exercising their legal right to an abortion is facing its biggest setback in years. After realizing that national abortion laws are a no-go, especially with a Democratic president, conservatives have attempted to use their control of state governments in order to roll back women s rights.But the recent 5-3 Supreme Court decision in the case of Whole Woman s Health v. Hellerstedt found that many of the roadblocks erected by the religious right through the Republican Party have put an  undue burden  on women seeking abortion services, and have to be struck down.As a result, there is a wave of anti-choice legislation being undone.Since Monday, laws restricting abortion and non-abortion Planned Parenthood funding have already been temporarily or permanently wiped out in six states. The Center for Reproductive Rights filed a new case Friday challenging a whopping seven of Louisiana s new abortion restrictions. And on the heels of Whole Woman s Health, Planned Parenthood Federation of America announced an effort to pursue repealing laws in eight states through legislatures. (Even lawmakers hostile to abortion may prefer the less expensive option of repealing a law, rather than having to defend one that is unlikely to stand after the Supreme Court s decision.)Now, Republican lawmakers who had planned more abortion restrictions are being forced to put their plans on ice or give up on them completely. They no longer have a blank check for their attacks on women s rights.And the right has a problem nationally. While polls show voters believe in some restrictions on choice, most Americans believe that a woman has a right to abortion services. The support is even higher among women, and Republicans have ceased to be a majority in presidential elections largely thanks to votes from women. It is a losing case for them to be so opposed to abortion rights.In this year s election, Hillary Clinton has already been hammering Donald Trump on choice. Clinton of course supports abortion rights, while since the campaign began Trump has argued in favor of  punishment  for women who get abortions once they are outlawed (as the Republican Party platform calls for).The current Supreme Court vacancy will be key to future battles over abortion, as will vacancies that are likely to open up over the next four years, in large part due to the advanced age of several of the justices, including liberal stalwart Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Featured image via Flickr",News,"July 1, 2016",1
 WATCH: Anderson Cooper Leaves Trump Supporter DUMBFOUNDED For Hypocrisy On Sexual Assault,"Trump mouthpiece Jeffrey Lord got his a** handed to him by Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night for once again bringing up Juanita Broaddrick in response to sexual assault allegations against the Republican nominee.During the segment, Cooper and the panel were discussing the women who have come forward to tell their stories about how Donald Trump groped them when Lord interrupted to complain that the women didn t talk about Jaunita Broaddrick and her accusations against Bill Clinton, even though Broaddrick has nothing to do with Trump s own behavior.Lord called the women s accusations into question, but Cooper was quick to drop the hammer on his hypocrisy. Why do you believe Juanita Broaddrick and not these two women,  Cooper asked, leaving a dumbfounded Lord to claim that the media isn t giving Clinton s accusers an  equal forum. But Clinton s accusers have no bearing on this election because Bill Clinton is not running for president, as other panelists reminded Lord. Furthermore, Bill Clinton was never charged with committing any crimes. Juanita Broaddrick filed a sworn affidavit stating that the rape allegations against Clinton are untrue. And these accusations against Clinton are 20 years old and have received a ton of media coverage over the years, especially during Clinton s presidency. The allegations against Trump, meanwhile, are new and haven t received near as much coverage.But Lord whined that the New York Times hasn t interviewed Broaddrick and then brought up a ridiculous anecdotal claim about meeting a couple from Virginia who supposedly think the media the treating Trump unfairly.When it became clear that Lord and Trump s other surrogates were not going to win this fight they resorted to calling Hillary Clinton an  enabler  of Bill Clinton behavior who supposedly bullied the women accusing Bill of sexual misconduct.But the other panelists would have none of it and proceeded to smack them down.Here s the video via YouTube:[ad3media campaign= 1136 ]The accusations against Bill Clinton have nothing to do with this election. Hillary Clinton is running for president, not her husband. Trump, on the other hand, IS running for president and the allegations against him are new and should be covered by the media.Donald Trump is unfit to be president and the fact that his supporters have to resort to bringing up Bill Clinton and his accusers in a lame effort to distract from that proves it.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 13, 2016",1
 WATCH: ‘The View’ Rips Trump For Not Having The Balls To Apologize For His Sexism,"Donald Trump is in deep sh*t because he refuses to apologize for sexist remarks he made about a Miss Universe contestant.During the presidential debate on Monday night, the Republican nominee took serious flack for fat-shaming Miss Universe contestant Alicia Machado just because she didn t conform to Trump s beauty standards for women.Hillary Clinton took Trump to task, informing him that Machado has a name and is going to vote in this election as are millions of other women across the country who also don t appreciate how he has treated women.On Tuesday, after Trump continued to insult Machado on Fox & Friends, the ladies of The View discussed his remarks and refusal to apologize, and even conservative panelist Jedediah Bila was disgusted by his behavior. Now this guy doesn t know how to apologize it seems, because this happened a long time ago and everybody has a past and all of us have said things that maybe we sit and say  I regret it,  the Fox host began.  It s seems though he doesn t regret it, because the comment here, the only acceptable remark is,  You know what? That was a long time ago when I was a different man and I m sorry. I m deeply sorry that I said those things. But Trump didn t apologize just like he has never apologized for any of the offensive remarks he has made over the years. He couldn t even apologize for his birtherism. That shows character, there s a character flaw here,  Bila declared before slamming Trump s supporters for blaming everyone around Trump instead of holding Trump responsible for his own personal words and actions.  And everybody wants to blame his handlers and say,  Why isn t he being told,  and I say, you know what, you re a grown man running for president, you re responsible for what you said, and you re responsible for owning up. And I don t care who your handlers are   grow up and say,  I m sorry. Joy Behar also summed up Trump s message.  The message is  don t vote for me,  she said.Here s the video via ABC.Donald Trump is not presidential material. He has no courage and zero moral fiber. He thinks he can say whatever he wants without consequence and while that may be the case on a reality show this is the political arena he is in now. Women represent more than half of the electorate, which makes pissing them off a very bad idea if the GOP hopes to stave off extinction. But his big mouth could have even more serious repercussions.If Trump pops off at the wrong time to the wrong people he could seriously affect our relations with other nations, especially nations with which we have serious tensions to work out. Trump s big mouth could easily sabotage crucial diplomatic negotiations or piss someone off enough to break ties with us. We need international cooperation now more than ever, especially if we hope to defeat ISIS. Insulting countries we need will not help us.And since he can t even treat most people in this country with respect, how can we really expect him to actually respect other nations?Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"September 28, 2016",1

 Trump In Poland: ‘Everyone’ In The U.S. Is Now ‘Getting Very Rich’ Because Of Me,"The current occupant of the White House traveled overseas and met with President Andrzej Duda of Poland at the Royal Castle in Warsaw, then continued to embarrass our country by bashing the media, refusing to say outright that Russia meddled in our 2016 presidential election. He then went on to tout his economy even though he s only been on the job for 167 days.On Thursday, the former reality show star Trump bragged about the U.S. economy, saying everyone else is getting rich.Trump spoke of U.S. stock market gains since he was elected, according to The Hill. Personally, I ve picked up nothing,  he said.  Everyone else is getting very rich. That s ok, I m very happy. On the 4th of July, Trump tweeted,  Really great numbers on jobs & the economy! Things are starting to kick in now, and we have just begun! Don t like steel & aluminum dumping! Really great numbers on jobs & the economy! Things are starting to kick in now, and we have just begun! Don't like steel & aluminum dumping!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2017While on the campaign trail, Trump said,  I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created  but that promise hasn t been kept. 594,000 jobs have been created since Trump took office and that s a dismal number if you compare it to Obama s record. And of the jobs created by the Trump administration, most of those can be attributed to Obama s economy. Businesses that were bleeding jobs unleashed the longest streak of job creation on record,  Obama wrote in a letter to the American people.The economy added jobs for 75 straight months.As for Trump bragging about jobs, the US employment growth is actually slowing.Trump says he hasn t made money but that, too, is a lie. Trump and his family members are shamelessly profiting from his so-called presidency. Trump said that  everyone  is getting rich but a quick visit to my bank online just showed me that that is not true.For the record, 11.3 million new jobs were created under President Obama.

Guatemala lawmakers curb penalties for illegal election financing,"GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemala s Congress on Wednesday approved a  national emergency  decree to curb penalties for illegal election financing after the country s president was linked to suspected irregularities during his 2015 election campaign. The change eliminates criminal responsibility for  authorizing  electoral funds that prove to be illegal and makes party accountants responsible for irregularities rather than party leaders. The reform, approved by a vote of 105-19, also reduces the penalty for illegal election financing from a maximum of 12 years to 10 and allows for paying a fine in order to avoid jail time. The decree was the latest blow to the prosecutor s office and the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) after Congress this week voted to preserve President Jimmy Morales  immunity from prosecution.  Prosecutors had sought to remove Morales  immunity to investigate him over some $800,000 in allegedly unexplained campaign funds when he was the head of his party. Prosecutors are also investigating Guatemala s other major parties.        Under the leadership of Ivan Velasquez, a veteran Colombian prosecutor, the CICIG has caused problems for Morales, first investigating his son and brother, and then seeking to prosecute him over the allegedly unexplained campaign funds.       The U.S. ambassador to Guatemala, Todd Robinson, expressed his disappointment in a message on Twitter.  Years of malnutrition, insecurity, crime, corruption. Congress? No action. Amazing how fast they act to protect selves from prosecution,  he said in a post.  Really? National emergency? What a shame!  ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",0
 IRS Slams Trump Foundation For Breaking The Law,"The Donald J. Trump Foundation just quietly paid an IRS fine for breaking the law. Trump paid the IRS a $2,500 fine after the Washington Post exposed that his foundation had broken the law by giving a political foundation to a group connected to Florida attorney general Pam Bondi.The improper donation, a $25,000 gift from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, was made in 2013. At the time, Attorney General Pam Bondi was considering whether to investigate fraud allegations against Trump University. She decided not to pursue the case.Bondi s decision to let Trump University skate despite allegations of wrongdoing after the Trump donation has caused considerable controversy, with some demanding an investigation into possible corruption by the Republican attorney general.The Washington Post found that Trump didn t notify the IRS about his donation and it was recorded as a donation to a completely different organization.In that year s tax filings, The Post reported, The Trump Foundation did not notify the IRS of this political donation. Instead, Trump s foundation listed a donation   also for $25,000   to a Kansas charity with a name similar to that of Bondi s political group. In fact, Trump s foundation had not given the Kansas group any money at all.The prohibited gift was, in effect, replaced with an innocent-sounding but nonexistent donation.Trump claims that the misfiled donation was simply a mistake, but it fits into a pattern of Trump and his organization and so-called charities moving money around in a dubious fashion. An investigation by the same newspaper has tried to verify Trump s wild claims of charitable donations, but has so far been completely unable to do so.Earlier this year, Trump had failed to donate to veteran s charities, despite his promise to do so months ago. He only finally gave in and gave money to veterans after the news reports surfaced and politicians like Hillary Clinton attacked him for stiffing the organization.Featured image via Flickr",News,"September 1, 2016",1
" FBI Releases DAMNING Information About Russian Collusion, Trump TERRIFIED","The Washington Post reported Tuesday that former Trump advisor Carter Page was one of the members of the Trump campaign who were monitored by the FBI because of their communications with Russia. As part of an investigation into the campaign that long predates Director James Comey s infamous  Clinton email  letter that helped swing the election in Donald Trump s favor, a judge granted the Bureau s request   a decision that is not made lightly:The FBI and the Justice Department obtained the warrant targeting Carter Page s communications after convincing a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power, in this case Russia, according to the officials.This is the clearest evidence so far that the FBI had reason to believe during the 2016 presidential campaign that a Trump campaign adviser was in touch with Russian agents. Such contacts are now at the center of an investigation into whether the campaign coordinated with the Russian government to swing the election in Trump s favor.Page says that the real story isn t the fire   it s that people reported the fire. This confirms all of my suspicions about unjustified, politically motivated government surveillance,  Page told the Post, failing to mention that a judge would not have granted the warrant if there was not already convincing evidence it was necessary.  I have nothing to hide. Ever since his administration began leaking like a colander, Trump and his crew have been working overtime to convince the American people that the information itself is unimportant (no matter how important it is), that the real problem is that someone is telling us about it. Page, of course, is no exception.The FBI officials did not reveal if the investigation uncovered evidence of a crime, but Page and the rest of the crew are acting very, very guilty.Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)",News,"April 12, 2017",1
U.S. Supreme Court justice candidate list still open: White House,"ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - The White House said on Friday that more candidates could be added to its list of potential nominees to fill the Supreme Court vacancy caused by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. “We are still in a position where the list is not closed at this point,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters during a briefing. “There are still people being considered for inclusion on the list of people that the president may consider for filling a Supreme Court vacancy.” The White House has not officially revealed its list of potential picks to replace Scalia. Earnest said he did not expect a nominee would be named before President Barack Obama meets with congressional leaders at the White House on Tuesday to discuss the matter. Scalia’s death left the court with four conservative and four liberal justices, meaning that Obama’s nominee could tip the balance of the court to the left for the first time in decades. Republicans, who control the Senate, have said the seat should remain vacant until Obama’s successor takes office next January so voters could have a say in the selection when they choose a new president in the Nov. 8 election. But Obama has vowed to press ahead with nominating a justice. Earnest said the White House would seek the help of former administration officials to coordinate outside activist groups in the fight over filling the vacancy. The New York Times first reported on Friday that the administration was recruiting former Obama adviser Stephanie Cutter and former White House director of legislative affairs Katie Beirne Fallon to help in its campaign. “We are going to draw on their contacts, and on the work they’re doing outside the administration to help us make the case, and organize the effort around the president’s constitutional responsibility to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court,” Earnest said.",politicsNews,"February 26, 2016 ",0
Trump open to dropping healthcare provision in Senate tax bill: aide,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump would not insist on including repeal of an Obama-era health insurance mandate in a bill intended to enact the biggest overhaul of the tax code since the 1980s, a senior White House aide said on Sunday. The version of tax legislation put forward by Senate Republican leaders would remove a requirement in former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law that taxes Americans who decline to buy health insurance. “If we can repeal part of Obamacare as part of a tax bill ... that can pass, that’s great,” White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “If it becomes an impediment to getting the best tax bill we can, then we are OK with taking it out.” It was too soon to say whether eliminating the repeal of the so-called individual mandate would increase the bill’s chances of passing. The provision was not an impediment now, Mulvaney said. Republican senators who have been critical of the plan said that some middle-income taxpayers could see any benefits of the tax cuts wiped out by higher health insurance premiums if the repeal of the Obamacare mandate goes through. Among them was Senator Susan Collins, one of a handful of Republicans who voted in July to block a broader Republican attempt to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. “I don’t think that provision should be in the bill. I hope the Senate will follow the lead of the House and strike it,” Collins said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Republicans can only afford to lose two votes on the tax bill because of their slim 52-48 majority in the Senate. Getting rid of the mandate is one of Republican Trump’s main goals. He campaigned for president last year on a promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, but Congress has not agreed so far on how to do that. Another top Trump administration official, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, said the individual mandate “isn’t a bargaining chip.” “The president thinks we should get rid of it and I think we should get rid of it,” he told “Fox News Sunday.”  Mnuchin said the objective “right now” was to keep repeal of the mandate in the bill. “We are going to work with the Senate as we go through this. We are going to get something to the president to sign this year,” he said. The House of Representatives last week passed its tax bill. Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, consider a tax bill critical to their party’s prospects in the 2018 U.S. congressional elections. Democrats call the Republican plan a giveaway to corporations and the rich. Trump had urged lawmakers to add repeal of the mandate to the tax bill, writing on Twitter last week that the provision was “unfair” and “highly unpopular.” The next day, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did just that. The mandate plays a critical role in Obamacare by requiring young, healthy people, who might otherwise go without coverage, to purchase insurance and help offset the costs of covering sicker and older Americans. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said that repealing the mandate would increase the number of Americans without health insurance by 13 million by 2027. Republican Senator Roy Blunt said he thought the Senate bill would pass with or without the individual mandate repeal. “It depends on where the votes are,” he told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Appearing on several television shows, Collins said she also wanted the Senate to “skew more of the relief to middle-income taxpayers.” She advocated keeping the top tax rate of 39.6 percent for people who make $1 million or more a year, as the House does, as well as the deduction for state and local taxes. The corporate tax does not need to be cut so steeply to 20 percent, Collins said. A 22 percent rate would garner an additional $200 billion and allow the Senate to restore the deduction for state and local property taxes, she told ABC. Collins has emerged as a pivotal lawmaker in the tax debate, along with Republican Senators John McCain, Lisa Murkowski and Ron Johnson, all of whom are also on the fence or oppose the bill. The Senate bill needs work, Collins told ABC’s “This Week.”  “I want to see changes in that bill,” she said. “And I think there will be changes.” ",politicsNews,"November 19, 2017 ",0
 Mike Pence’s New DC Neighbors Are HILARIOUSLY Trolling Him For Being A Homophobic Bigot,"Mike Pence is a huge homophobe. He supports ex-gay conversion therapy, opposes hate crimes protections for LGBTQ people, is staunchly against marriage equality, and once said that he believes that same-sex couples will lead to  societal collapse.  To that end, the folks who are being forced to live near the now- vice president-elect near his newly rented house in Washington, DC are none too happy with their new neighbor. However, instead of protesting him with rallies in the streets, they ve decided to troll him instead.The residents in the Chevy Chase neighborhood are hanging large rainbow flags on their homes to send a signal to Mike Pence   that his homophobia is not welcome in their neck of the wood. According to local station WJLA: A respectful message showing, in my case, my disagreement with some of his thinking,  said Ilse Heintzen.The  he  Heintzen is referring to is Vice-President Elect Mike Pence. Pence moved into a house on Heintzen s block where he will stay on-and-off until he moves into the Vice-President s mansion on the grounds of the Naval Observatory next year.Neighbors started hanging the pride flags after the VP-Elect moved in because the LGBTQ community has criticized Pence s policies regarding LGBTQ rights.Here are a couple images of the collective rainbow F-YOU to Pence, via Twitter:#Pride flags sending message to @mike_pence outside temporary #DC home.

On the other hand, this likely will cause another meltdown from Trump, who will undoubtedly accuse these people of  harassing  Pence for his bigoted views, just as happened with the Hamilton staff.Either way, this signals that there will be absolutely no tolerance for their bigotry, no matter how hard they push.

Putin quips he's ready to grant asylum to ex-FBI chief Comey,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin joked on Thursday that if former FBI director James Comey suffers persecution because of his falling-out with U.S. President Donald Trump, Russia is ready to grant him asylum. The offer, made with Putin’s trademark sardonic humor, came as the Russian president poured scorn on Comey for his role in a row in Washington over alleged Russian meddling in last year’s U.S. presidential election. At a congressional hearing this month, Comey said Trump asked him to drop an investigation into contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials, while the U.S. president has accused Comey of not telling the truth. Asked about Comey at a question-and-answer session with Russian voters, Putin said it was “strange” that, while still FBI director, Comey had passed the contents of a conversation he had with Trump to the media via a friend. “What is the difference then between the FBI director and Mr. Snowden?” Putin said, referring to former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who was granted asylum in Russia in 2013 after leaking classified information about U.S. spy operations. “In this case, he (Comey) is not the head of a special service but a human rights activist who defends a certain position,” Putin said. “By the way, if he is subject to any sort of persecution in connection with this, we will be ready to give him political asylum in Russia. And he should know about this.” Striking a more serious note, Putin said Comey, in his congressional testimony, had produced no proof that Russia had meddled in the U.S. election. “I am not familiar in detail with the testimony given by former FBI director Comey,” Putin said. “Again, he gave no evidence of this (Russian interference).” “And what about constant U.S. propaganda, constant U.S. support of America-oriented non-governmental organizations by giving them money directly? Isn’t it an impact on our minds? Isn’t it an attempt to influence how we should behave during election campaigns? This continues year after year,” he said. Putin said many heads of state around the world had told him of similar U.S. meddling in their internal affairs. But they would not voice their concerns openly, fearing they would “spoil relations” with Washington, he said.  As for Russia, “we have an opinion of our own, we express it openly. But this is not any sort of underground, subversive activity”, Putin said. ",politicsNews,"June 15, 2017 ",0

 The Ridiculous Reasons Obama’s Half-Brother Is Voting For Trump (VIDEO),"The right is giddy over the fact that President Obama s Kenyan half-brother Malik says he plans to vote for Donald Trump. They shouldn t be. His reasons for voting for the braggadocios billionaire are even worse than the reasons for most Americans.Malik Obama lives in Kenya, but he is eligible to vote in the United States because he sometimes lives in Maryland and he worked there. Rupert Murdoch s New York Post claims that Malik is registered to vote in the United States.Malik is the oldest of the Obama brothers; he s related through their father, but the two men have different mothers. The older Obama, 58, has spent most of his life as a Democrat, but likes Trump s slogan of  Mak(ing) America Great Again.  He doesn t like Hillary Clinton s email scandal, and he has more than one personal bone to pick with his younger brother.About Trump: I like Donald Trump because he speaks from the heart,  Malik Obama told The Post from his home in the rural village of Kogelo.  Make America Great Again is a great slogan. I would like to meet him. About Hillary Clinton and the email situation: She should have known better as the custodian of classified information,  said Obama.The third reason makes one question whether Malik had been a Democrat at all. The man who reportedly has as many as 12 wives hates the idea of marriage equality. I feel like a Republican now because they don t stand for same-sex marriage, and that appeals to me,  he said.Then, it gets a bit more personal. The elder Obama says that he was close, personal friends with ousted and assassinated dictator, Muammar Gaddafi. I still feel that getting rid of Khadafy didn t make things any better in Libya,  he said.  My brother and the secretary of state disappointed me in that regard. Malik has an even more personal beef with his brother. It s about money. Malik is in charge of the Barack H. Obama Foundation, which named after the Obamas  father. The foundation was set up to help people in their native village in Kenya, but it hadn t registered with the state of Virginia, from which it was run. Shortly after the story became public, the IRS approved the foundation s tax exempt status. Fingers pointed at President Obama, but Malik insists his brother didn t help at all, and for that, he seems to resent him. My brother didn t help me at all,  said Obama.  He wanted me to shut it down when I set it up. He hasn t supported me at all. Oh, and the President also refused to intervene in his older brother s foray into politics, when he ran for governor of his Kenyan county. Malik partly blames his brother for his loss.Here s the video:Trump, in the meantime, is loving it. Wow, President Obama s brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2016None of this should be terribly surprising. Despite the fact that the two men were best men at each others  weddings, Malik got on the birther train. He even questioned whether the President actually shared a father with him. Of course, we can also go birther, asking if Malik is actually registered to vote.Featured image via New York Post screenshot.",News,"July 24, 2016",1
Syrian opposition aims for Assad's removal in Geneva talks,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The Syrian opposition delegation at peace talks in Geneva is aiming for the removal of President Bashar al-Assad and plans to engage his negotiators in serious and direct talks, the head of the opposition delegation Nasr Hariri said on Monday. Hariri called for major powers, especially Russia, to pressure the Assad government into real negotiations on a political transition followed by a new constitution and free elections, in line with a U.N. roadmap to end the six-year war.  We stress that political transition which achieves the ousting of Assad at the beginning is our goal,  Hariri told a news conference after arriving in Geneva for a round of U.N.-led talks that is scheduled to start on Tuesday.   Our goal in the negotiation will be the departure of Bashar al-Assad from the beginning of the transition,  he said. A breakthrough in U.N.-backed Syria peace talks in Geneva this week seems hardly more likely than in seven failed earlier rounds as Assad pushes for total military victory and his opponents stick by their demand he leave power. All previous diplomatic initiatives have swiftly collapsed over the opposition demand that Assad must go and his refusal to do so. The Syrian government delegation, led by its U.N. ambassador and chief negotiator Bashar al-Ja afari, failed to arrive in Geneva on Monday when it had been due. It was not clear whether the delegation would arrive on Tuesday, when U.N. mediator Staffan de Mistura is due to meet the opposition.  We don t have high hopes, the regime is using delaying tactics to obstruct progress toward a political solution, at a time when the opposition comes with one unified delegation,  Hariri said.  Russia .. .is the only entity capable of bringing the regime to the table of negotiations.  For many years, Western and Arab countries backed the opposition demand that Assad leave office. However, since Russia joined the war on behalf of Assad s government two years ago it has become increasingly clear that Assad s opponents have no path to victory on the battlefield. The Syrian civil war, now in its seventh year, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and caused the world s worst refugee crisis, driving 11 million from their homes. The Syrian government continued its bombing and sieges of areas including 400,000 people in eastern Ghouta, a rebel-held Damascus suburb, Hariri said on Monday.  We are here for the hundreds of thousands who under siege who are in grave need of humanitarian aid and for hundreds of thousands of detainees who are at the verge of death, suffering but living death every day,  he said.

Sumwalt, the safety board official who is leading the investigation, said an assistant conductor had reported that she believed she heard a radio transmission in which an engineer on a regional line said his train had been struck by a projectile and the engineer on the Amtrak train replied that his had been struck, too.Mr. Sumwalt said that investigators had found a fist-size circular area of impact on the left side of the Amtrak train s windshield and that they had asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation to analyze it. He said that the F.B.I. had been called in because it has the forensics expertise needed for the investigation, but that it had not yet begun its analysis.He said that investigators had also interviewed the engineer and found him  extremely cooperative,  and that the engineer had said he was not fatigued or ill at the time of the accident. But he could not remember anything about the derailment.Investigators asked the engineer, Brandon Bostian, whether he recalled any projectiles, and he said he did not. He was specifically asked that question, and he did not recall anything of that sort,  Mr. Sumwalt said.  But then again, he reported that he does not have any recollection of anything past North Philadelphia. The assistant conductor, however, who was working in the cafe car, heard Mr. Bostian talking to an engineer on the Septa regional rail line who said his train had been  hit by a rock or shot at,  according to Mr. Sumwalt. She said she thought she heard Mr. Bostian reply that his train had also been struck. Right after she recalled hearing this conversation between her engineer and the Septa engineer, she said she felt a rumbling, and her train leaned over and her car went over on its side,  Mr. Sumwalt said.Jerri Williams, a spokeswoman at Septa, confirmed that the windshield of one of its trains had been shattered by a projectile near the North Philadelphia station about 9:10 p.m. on Tuesday, about 12 minutes before the Amtrak train derailed. We have reports of trains  being struck by objects in this area about two to three times a month,  Ms. Williams said. Mostly, she said, the objects are thrown by children and do no damage.The safety board has asked to interview the engineer of the Septa train that was hit by the projectile, and Septa is cooperating, Ms. Williams said.For days, speculation about the cause of the accident has centered on Mr. Bostian. Investigators reported earlier this week that the train accelerated suddenly a minute before the derailment and that Mr. Bostian applied the emergency brake seconds before the cars careened off the tracks, striking nearby utility poles.On Friday, Mr. Sumwalt said that the engineer, accompanied by his lawyer, had been open with investigators and had demonstrated a  very good working knowledge  of the proper procedures and speeds for the rail line, but that he did not remember the accident. He recalls ringing the train bell as he went through North Philadelphia Station, as required,  Mr. Sumwalt said.  He has no recollection of anything past that. Investigators said that Mr. Bostian had been  extremely  cooperative during his interview and that he had  reported no problems with his train handling. Two other conductors were on the train that night. A senior conductor is hospitalized, according to the safety board, and has not been interviewed.A junior conductor was in the back of the train and reported that his radio was not working, so he was unable to hear the engineer, Mr. Sumwalt said. He told investigators he felt shaking, then two large impacts that dislodged seats.Both conductors said they had confidence in the engineer, calling him  very professional.

Philippine military chief says 'matter of days' before Marawi liberated,"MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippine military will liberate southern Marawi City in a matter of days, the country s armed forces chief said on Monday, after the deaths of two key militant leaders he said would lead to the crumbling of a pro-Islamic state alliance. The bodies of Omarkhayam Maute and Isnilon Hapilon had been retrieved and identified by authorities, but there were still about 30 fighters in the combat zone who were in disarray, General Eduardo Ano told a televised news conference. Top Malaysian operative Mahmud Ahmad and foreign fighters were still believed to be in the battle zone, he said, adding that there would be  no letup  in the fight to wipe out groups loyal to Islamic State after Marawi was retaken.

Trump win opens way for China to take climate leadership role,"WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - The election of climate change skeptic Donald Trump as president is likely to end the U.S. leadership role in the international fight against global warming and may lead to the emergence of a new and unlikely champion: China. China worked closely with the administration of outgoing President Barack Obama to build momentum ahead of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. The partnership of the two biggest greenhouse gas emitters helped get nearly 200 countries to support the pact at the historic meet in France’s capital. By contrast, Trump has called global warming a hoax created by China to give it an economic advantage and said he plans to remove the United States from the historic climate agreement, as well as reverse many of Obama’s measures to combat climate change.  He has appointed noted climate change skeptic Myron Ebell to help lead transition planning for the Environmental Protection Agency, which has crafted the administration’s major environmental regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and efficiency standards for cars and trucks. Beijing is poised to cash in on the goodwill it could earn by taking on leadership in dealing with what for many other governments is one of the most urgent issues on their agenda. “Proactively taking action against climate change will improve China’s international image and allow it to occupy the moral high ground,” Zou Ji, deputy director of the National Centre for Climate Change Strategy and a senior Chinese climate talks negotiator, told Reuters. Zou said that if Trump abandons efforts to implement the Paris agreement, “China’s influence and voice are likely to increase in global climate governance, which will then spill over into other areas of global governance and increase China’s global standing, power and leadership.” Chen Zhihua, a representative of the Chinese delegation and official in the climate change division of the National Development and Reform Commission, the country’s economic planning agency, said Chinese and other countries’ efforts will not change if the United States withdraws from the agreement.  “Action by the international community will not stop because of the new government of the United States. We still have confidence the international community will join hands and continue our efforts on climate change,” he told reporters at the 200-nation U.N. meeting being held in Marrakesh to start fleshing out the implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement seeks to phase out net greenhouse gas emissions by the second half of the century and limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. Each country has put forward national plans to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Some have raised concerns that without involvement and financial support from the United States, emerging economies like India may feel inclined to back out. One of the key advisors to Obama’s team on climate change said he hoped China would take on the mantle and keep the global climate deal alive.  Beijing should “continue to work in the spirit that we worked together in and before Paris,” said Andrew Light, former senior adviser to previous U.S. Special Envoy on Climate Change Todd Stern. It is an ironic twist for the government of the world’s second-largest economy. For years, Beijing fought attempts by foreign governments to limit carbon emissions, claiming it should be allowed the same space to develop and pollute that industrialized nations had. But with its capital often choked by smog and its people angry about the environmental devastation that rapid development has wrought across the country, Beijing has become a proponent of efforts to halt global warming rather than a hindrance. “China is acting on climate for the benefit of its own people,” said Erik Solheim, executive director of the UN Environment Programme. “I am confident China will take a lead role.” China has powerful domestic and global imperatives to play a high-profile role in continued global climate change talks, meant to avert more heat waves, droughts, floods and rising sea levels that could cause trillions of dollars of damage by 2100. China sees a perceived role as global climate leader as way to bolster its aspiration to become a “clean energy superpower” by leading in renewable energy technology such as wind and solar power and asserting itself as a key geopolitical power.         Dealing with the pressures of continued urbanization in some of the world’s largest cities has already put China ahead, said Andrew Steer, the president of environmental think tank the World Resources Institute.  Beijing is innovating to build low-carbon cities, he said.     “It sees carbon as an indicator of economic inefficiency,” Steer said. Trump’s victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton darkened the mood of delegates attending the current round of climate talks in Marrakesh.     Some delegates at the talks say that China is already setting an example.     “China is surprising us daily. Whatever they’ve promised they’re delivering,” said Tosi Mpanu Mpanu, of Democratic Republic of Congo, who heads the 48-nation group of least developed countries at the talks.

 BREAKING: Evidence Trump Colluded With Russia Is Now ‘More Than Circumstantial’ (DETAILS),"The Democratic ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee dropped a bombshell Wednesday afternoon when he revealed that there is  more than circumstantial evidence now  of collusion between Donald Trump and Russia.Speaking to MSNBC s Chuck Todd, Rep. Adam Schiff said the evidence that Trump s team colluded with Russia is no longer just circumstantial. On Sunday, Schiff said that there was circumstantial evidence of collusion and direct evidence  of deception, but today, he said there is more.When Todd asked him if the case for collusion was only circumstantial, Schiff said, I can tell you that the case is more than that. I can t go in to the particulars but there is more than circumstantial evidence now,  Schiff said. You have seen direct evidence of collusion?  Todd asked. I don t want to go into specifics but I will say that there is evidence that is not circumstantial and very much worthy of investigation  Schiff said.This is the furthest a lawmaker has gone regarding proof that Trump was working with Russia to cheat his way into the White House.On Monday, during a hearing before the House Intelligence Committee, FBI Director James Comey publicly confirmed that the bureau is investigation both Russia s interference in the election and the possibility that Trump was in cahoots with Putin the whole time. Comey also testified that this investigation began way back in July of 2016.You can watch Schiff s interview here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"March 22, 2017",1
WATCH: IRAN Made VIDEOTAPE Of Secret $400 Million Ransom Cash-Drop From U.S. To Mock Obama’s Embarrassing Incompetence [VIDEO],"It s starting to get old but Trump was right again   Iranian state-run media in Tehran did indeed videotape the arrival of a January 17 flight carrying $400 million in cash from the United States   and the money itself   judging from a documentary that aired the following month in the Islamic republic. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has been in a firestorm of controversy since first claiming on Wednesday to have seen  secret  footage of money being offloaded from an aircraft.He admitted Friday morning on Twitter what his campaign had said more than a day earlier, that he had seen ordinary archival footage of a different plane, carrying American hostages freed from Iran arriving in Geneva Switzerland after the money changed hands. But it turns out he may have been right without knowing it.The Iranian video was aired February 15 on the state-run Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting television network, as part of a documentary called  Rules of the Game.  A narrator, speaking in Persian, describes a money-for-hostages transaction over video clips of a plane on an airport tarmac in the dead of night and a photo of a giant shipping pallet stacked with what appear to be banknotes.The federal government shipped what many are calling a ransom payment in Euros and other non-U.S. currencies.The copy of the documentary footage DailyMail.com obtained is not of high enough quality to determine which nation s banknotes are depicted.None of the footage is stamped with a date or time, making it impossible to know when it was shot.And the broadcaster blurred out one portion of the screen, covering up something resting on top of the mountain of money.But the documentary begins with a narration saying:  In the early morning hours of January 17, 2016 at Mehrabad Airport, $400 million in cash was transported to Iran on an airplane. The film describes the Obama administration s prisoner swap and Iran s cash windfall from Tehran s point of view as  a win-lose deal that benefits the Islamic Republic of Iran and hurts the United States,  according to two English-language translations DailyMail.com obtained.

MICHELLE OBAMA Wanted Biden To Run So He Could Beat Hillary [Video],"Has their ever been a more vengeful and hateful First Lady?They are the elite group of women who occupy the East Wing of the White House as their husbands serve as presidents of the United States.Viewed as  the true modern power brokers of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , the first ladies have had different takes on their public positions and either love the proximity to the country s top policy advisers or view it as serving a prison term of teas, luncheons, dinners and photo ops.There are friendships among this sorority of first ladies and turbulent rivalries as well as  relationships fraught with hurt feelings and resentment, like that between Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama , Kate Andersen Brower writes in her new book, First Women, the Grace and Power of America s Modern First Ladies, published by Harper. The 2008 presidential campaign left deep and lasting scars on both the Clinton and the Obama camps, and they are still shockingly fresh. Michelle, now 52, never forgot how Hillary mocked her husband s message of  hope and change  at a campaign rally in Ohio during that campaign. The sky will open, the light will come down, celestial choirs will be singing, and everyone will know that we should do the right thing, and the world would be perfect,  Clinton said.Watch Hillary starting at the 45 second mark:Hillary was right; that certainly didn t happen and she has remained bitter for years that Senator Ted Kennedy, who had been her mentor in the Senate, did not support her presidential candidacy in 2008.A source in Hillary s inner circle told the author that Hillary, now 68, is running again for president out of vengeance for that loss. She needs to win.Obama is viewed by Hillary s circle of people as not having the same work ethic as Hillary who they see as having a long record of dedicated public service.Those Clinton acolytes also suggest that  Michelle has not done enough as first lady  and has failed to prioritize funding for some programs that subsequently lost their federal support.One such program was Save America s Treasures, a program that Hillary started to help preserve and protect historic sites, arts and published works and was lovingly carried on by Laura Bush, the next first lady.Michelle felt no such obligation to those treasures and let the program dissolve.Michelle s feelings towards Hillary were blatantly obvious when no couple dinners were scheduled at the Obama White House while Hillary was secretary of state and frequently meeting with the President.Michelle is very close to Jill Biden and Vice President Joe Biden. She was hoping that Biden would run against Hillary for the Democratic nomination and his win would take away the sweet taste of victory once again for Hillary.

 Trump Biographer: The Donald Has A Long History Of Lying About Taping People To Intimidate Them,"Donald Trump has made quite the fuss about tapes of conversations between himself and former FBI Director James Comey. Problem is, no one is even convinced that these tapes exist. According to biographer Tim O Brien, this wouldn t be the first time Trump has lied about taping people when he didn t as a method of intimidation.O Brien authored the book, TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald. But Trump subsequently lost his sh*t and filed a lawsuit in 2005 because O Brien s book said he was only worth a measly $250 million. Suing ended up being a big mistake, as Trump ended up busted for making at least 30 false statements during a deposition. His loose association with the truth becomes problematic when he s confronted with documents,  O Brien told CNN host Brian Stelter during an interview on Sunday morning.  We ve had decades now of Trump frequently lying or exaggerating about a wide range of things. The author also let it be known that Trump has a long history of lying to people about tapes of conversations just so he can try to intimidate them into doing what he wants. He s said this over the years to reporters when they go into the Trump organization,  I just want to let you know that I m taping you right now,  O Brien said.  And he said it multiple times during my interviews with him. He said that into my own tape recorder when I recorded our interviews. But when he sat down for the deposition, my attorney said,  Mr. Trump, do you have a taping system?  he added.  And he said no. And [my attorney] said,  Why did you say this to Mr. O Brien.  And he essentially said,  I wanted to intimidate him. O Brien s comments make it even more doubtful that Trump actually as any tapes of Comey at all. Which is actually quite disappointing since they would almost certainly show that Comey was telling the truth when he testified under oath that Trump had tried to get him to drop the Russia investigation and pledge loyalty, which is clearly obstruction of justice. What a pity. If there really were tapes we would be that much closer towards getting this moron out of the White House.You can watch O Brian s interview here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"June 11, 2017",1
California sues Trump administration over sanctuary policy,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - California sued the U.S. Department of Justice on Monday over federal restrictions on some law enforcement grants to so-called sanctuary cities, continuing a legal counterattack by Democrats against President Donald Trump’s administration. The city of San Francisco also filed its own lawsuit against the Justice Department late last week, saying the federal government has improperly sought to force local jurisdictions to enforce national immigration law by imposing funding conditions. President Donald Trump issued a broad executive order in January targeting wide swaths of federal funding for cities that generally offer illegal immigrants safe harbor by declining to use municipal resources to enforce federal immigration laws.  However, a San Francisco judge drastically limited the scope of that policy in a previous lawsuit filed by the city. The Justice Department then sought to impose conditions on a national grant for local law enforcement that mandates access to local jails for federal immigration officials, as well as 48 hours notice before releasing anyone wanted for immigration violations.  California’s lawsuit opposing those conditions, as well as San Francisco’s case, is similar to a legal challenge filed last week by the city of Chicago. In a statement on Monday, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said the state, not the federal government, is best suited to determine how best to allocate its law enforcement resources. “When President Trump threatened to defund our local law enforcement’s ability to do its job and protect our people, he picked the wrong fight,” Becerra said.  A Justice Department spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. The Trump administration contends that local authorities endanger public safety when they decline to hand over for deportation illegal immigrants arrested for crimes. California receives about $28 million a year in federal law enforcement funding that would be subject to the new conditions, the state said in its lawsuit.  San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera on Monday said San Francisco receives about $1.4 million in such funds. Immigration enforcement is the federal government’s job, he said. “We’re not stopping them,” Herrera said. “But our police and deputies are focused on fighting crime, not breaking up hard-working families.” ",politicsNews,"August 14, 2017 ",0
"Arms supplied by U.S., Saudi ended up with Islamic State, researchers say","BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Arms provided by the United States and Saudi Arabia to Syrian opposition groups frequently ended up in the hands of Islamic State, an arms monitoring group that analyzed weapons found on the battlefield said on Thursday. Conflict Armament Research (CAR) said most Islamic State weapons were looted from the Iraqi and Syrian armies. But some were originally provided by other countries, mainly the United States and Saudi Arabia, to Syrian opposition groups fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.  These findings are a stark reminder of the contradictions inherent in supplying weapons into armed conflicts in which multiple competing and overlapping non-state armed groups operate,  the group said in a 200-page report. CAR documented at least 12 cases of weaponry purchased by the United States that ended up in Islamic State s hands, either captured on the battlefield or acquired through shifting alliances within the Syrian opposition. Most of these items later ended up in Iraq, the monitor said. In one case, it took only two months for Islamic State fighters in Iraq to get their hands on a guided anti-tank missile the United States bought from a European country and supplied to a Syrian opposition group. All of the items were made in EU states, and in most cases the United States broke contractual clauses prohibiting retransfers by giving the weapons to armed groups in Syria.  Evidence collected by CAR indicates that the United States has repeatedly diverted EU-manufactured weapons and ammunition to opposition forces in the Syrian conflict. IS forces rapidly gained custody of significant quantities of this materiel.  CAR said it similarly traced numerous items used by Islamic State back to exports from Bulgaria to Saudi Arabia, and that these were also subject to non-retransfer clauses that should have barred them from being supplied to Syrian warring parties. Around 90 percent of weapons and ammunition used by Islamic State in Syria and Iraq were made in China, Russia, and Eastern European countries, CAR said, with China and Russia alone accounting for over 50 percent.  These findings support widespread assumptions that the group initially captured much of its military materiel from Iraqi and Syrian government forces,  the report said. Russian-made weapons used by Islamic State in Syria outnumbered Chinese ones,  presumably reflecting Russian supplies to the Syrian regime,  CAR said. Russia is allied with Assad and launched air strikes in Syria in September 2015, its biggest Middle East intervention in decades, turning the tide of the conflict in his favor. On Saturday Iraq declared final victory over Islamic State, which seized more than a third of the country s territory in 2014. Last week Russia declared victory over the group in Syria. CAR reported last year that Islamic State had been making its own weapons on a scale and with sophistication matching national military forces, and that it had standardized production across its realm.

" Well It Happened, Trump Gets Desperate And Goes Full BENGHAZI On Hillary (TWEET)","It would appear that Donald Trump knows his base of voters don t pay attention to facts and reality, so he s going to keep perpetuating myths and propaganda to anger these people into voting for him even though his claims hold no basis in reality. And in the world of politics and mudslinging, it doesn t much matter as long as your message sticks and you get votes. However, these lies will get debunked, and there s nothing to stop that either.It s become very clear at this point that the presumptive Republican nominee has switched into attack mode against Democratic front-funner Hillary Clinton. If he s not going after her for what her husband did, he s going after her for literally being a woman.Now, knowing how much many conservatives can t wrap their heads around the fact that the Obama administration, including then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, did no wrongdoing in regards to the attack on Americans in Benghazi, Libya, he s going to keep pushing the issue anyway.

Republican 'Dump Trump' effort struggles to gain traction,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. (Reuters) - A plan to block Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump struggled to gain traction on Friday as rival candidates rejected it, while Democrats reveled in the chaos they hoped would boost their chances of keeping the White House.  The country’s top elected Republican, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, said he was not interested in an effort to draft him into the White House race. And U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, a conservative presidential hopeful, ruled out a deal to pick a compromise Republican candidate at the party’s July convention, which senior party figures see as their best chance to stop the unpredictable billionaire.   “The D.C. power brokers will drop someone in who is exactly to the liking of the establishment. If that will happen we will have a manifold revolt in this country,” Cruz said at the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington. “You want to beat Donald Trump, you beat Donald Trump with the voters,” he said.  Party leaders worry Trump would not be able to beat Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in the election, but time is running out after he won most of the states that voted in this week’s Super Tuesday. Senior Republicans also fear Trump’s plans to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and ban Muslims from entering the United States will turn off voters in November and upset U.S. allies. Others note his past support for liberal policies and question whether he has any agenda other than advancing himself. “I don’t think he actually carries the conservative mantle. He’s a little too crass for me,” said Michele Minter, a San Diego executive assistant who was attending CPAC. Trump, a former reality TV star, often plays by his own set of rules. He canceled plans to speak at CPAC, normally an essential stop for ambitious Republicans, and will instead attend a rally in Kansas.  The real estate magnate, who is drawing support from many blue-collar Republicans concerned about illegal immigration and stagnant wages, has won most Republican nominating contests and leads in many polls for the primary contests still to come. “I’m not a normal Republican,” he said to huge cheers at a rally in Warren, Michigan. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, the only candidate to ever challenge Trump’s months-long lead in opinion polls, officially ended his White House bid. “There are a lot of people who love me, they just won’t vote for me,” Carson said in a speech at CPAC, held in National Harbor, Maryland. A new group called the Committee to Draft Speaker Ryan filed papers with the Federal Election Commission on Thursday, seeking to raise money to push Ryan as a Republican alternative. Ryan, a budget wonk who was the Republican vice presidential candidate in 2012, is seen by many in the party as a unifier after he took the speaker’s job last year to unite establishment Republican lawmakers and conservative upstarts in the House. “He is flattered, but not interested,” Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said in an email on Friday. As Trump cements his front-runner status, senior party figures hope to deny him enough delegates to clinch the nomination, which would give them the chance to choose a compromise candidate at their convention in Cleveland. The last time that happened at a Republican convention was  in 1948 when Thomas Dewey was nominated.  Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said there was an 85 to 90 percent chance that the party will not face that scenario this year. Mitt Romney and John McCain, the party’s last two presidential nominees, called on Republicans to halt Trump’s rise by backing whichever candidate was strongest in their state, a form of tactical voting.  Few elected officials are rallying behind the “Dump Trump” banner. The party’s 31 state governors, for example, are not lining up behind an alternative. Only five have endorsed Florida Senator Marco Rubio and one has backed Cruz, in a sharp contrast to previous years when governors overwhelmingly endorsed the party’s eventual nominee. Rubio has only one state so far and is gearing up for what could be a make-or-break contest in his home state on March 15. Cruz said Saturday he planned to open 10 campaign offices there, in what could be an effort to force the rival senator out of the race. Trump is expected to extend his lead on Saturday, when a total of 155 delegates are at stake in Kansas, Louisiana, Maine and Kentucky.  Democrats were happy to let Republicans fight amongst themselves. “We can sit back and let them light their own dumpster fire and wait until they’re finished,” said Eddie Vale, spokesman for American Bridge, a Clinton-allied group which collects negative research on Republican candidates. “They’re giving us so much great video footage that we could run ads between now and November of nothing but Republicans attacking Trump,” Vale told Reuters.                 Nationally, Trump has the support of 41 percent of Republican voters, compared to 19 percent who back Cruz and 16 percent who back Rubio, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling data.

 HORRIBLE News For Do-Nothing GOP: Americans Support Paid Family Leave Across Political Lines,"Republican lawmakers oppose paid family leave. But the majority of Americans say they support it, which is bad news for the GOP.As Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders vie for the Democratic nomination, one of their shared interests includes support of a federal law that mandates paid family leave.Paid family leave would allow workers to take time off to care for a newborn child or deal with any other family illnesses without having to worry about not getting a paycheck to take care of the bills.The Family and Medical Leave Act already requires employers to give workers 12 weeks of leave, but the only drawback is that the leave is unpaid, which means many workers can t afford to take that much time off if any at all. Paid leave would change that.Three states already have such a law on the books and other states are poised to follow suit. However, because Congress is controlled by Republicans, the effort to pass a federal mandatory paid leave law has gone nowhere because of GOP obstruction.But as the idea becomes more and more popular among Americans, Republicans may be forced to fall in line, and a new poll makes it clear that the GOP should start paying attention to what the people want.According to the Associated Press,An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll released Friday said 72 percent support paid family leave. Democrats were more likely to back it, but Republicans also expressed strong support. Overall, support was stronger among people age 40-64 and among women.Strong support among Republicans means that GOP lawmakers may have no choice but to throw their support behind the effort if they want to make their constituents happy.In Michigan, which is controlled by Republicans at the moment, Mary Jo Morelli says she supports paid family leave because  I feel that in the U.S., we need to realize that employees, or the workers, can t really do the best job possible if you are worrying about a family member. Pushing for paid family leave would put Republicans in a difficult spot since they would rick losing their corporate sponsorship if they side with workers on the issue. And if they chose to side with corporations, they risk being booted out of office by the voters, which means the issue has enough power to flip state legislatures into Democratic hands if enough voters are made aware of the campaign to enact paid family leave.The Associated Press reports that despite such a law existing in California about 44 percent had never heard of it. That means people in every state need to be educated about paid family leave and how it can benefit them so that the fight can be taken more seriously by lawmakers.Because a happier, healthier workforce is what is best for business and America.Featured Image: Pete Souza ",News,"May 20, 2016",1
UAE asks banks for information on 19 Saudis' accounts: sources,"ABU DHABI/DUBAI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates central bank has asked banks and finance companies in the UAE to provide information on the accounts of 19 Saudi citizens, banking sources told Reuters on Thursday. Saudi authorities have previously confirmed that almost all the 19 have been detained in a sweeping corruption investigation.

The regulators  request was contained in a circular sent earlier this week and banks have responded, the sources said, adding that the banks had not been asked to freeze the accounts.  Officials at the central bank were not available to comment. Commercial bankers said they believed UAE authorities were acting at the request of Saudi authorities, but this was not confirmed. Saudi officials have said they will try to recover billions of dollars of illicit assets from dozens of senior businessmen and officials detained in the probe. Saudi Arabia has mutual legal assistance arrangements with other Gulf Arab countries that help it seek such information in criminal cases.  ",worldnews,"November 9, 2017 ",0

Jim Jordan last week told Fox News that he wants Rice to answer the basic question:  Did you unmask the names and if so why? He also argued that Americans indeed deserve to know the truth about the Trump associates but they also want answers from high-ranking Obama administration officials who may have misled Americans on critical matters   including Rice, as U.S. ambassador to the U.N., saying the fatal 2012 Benghazi terror attacks were largely  sparked  by an anti-Muslim video. The American people want to get the truth on all of these issues,  said Jordan. He also raised concerns about how Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch handled the Clinton email investigation and whether James Comey exposed classified information in an apparent effort to retaliate against Trump firing him as FBI director.Rice has denied that she did anything inappropriate, saying she was authorized as Obama s national security adviser to seek the identities of people whose names were redacted from intelligence reports.And she has suggested that her race and gender may be playing a role in the controversy, in a recent New York Magazine interview.   Fox NewsIt would be more shocking to the American people if Rice didn t use her race and gender as an excuse for committing heinous crimes against American citizens. It s the only card left in the deck for a cheating, lying and deceitful administration with their backs firmly against the wall Fox News legal anchor Gregg Jarrett said Rice is lying. Jarrett goes on to explain exactly how Rice potentially committed 3 felonies:So THIS is why Susan Rice refuses to testify: she knows she committed three different felonies for Obama! #LockHerUp pic.twitter.com/fg37CijZPu  Newt-Trump Fan Club (@NewtTrump) July 18, 2017Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) told Obama sycophant and Trump-hater Mika Brzezinski on MSNBC s  The Morning Joe  that he believes Susan Rice  abused the system and she did it for political purposes. Rand told Brzezinski that Susan Rice  needs to be brought in and questioned under oath.  Of course, Mika defended Rice, and then quickly qualified her obviously biased defense of Obama s former NSA director by saying she wasn t defending her.RAND PAUL: Drag Susan Rice in   make her testify under oath!

Gingrich went on to explain how much more serious the spying activities of Obama and Susan Rice were in comparison to Watergate:  You have the power of the federal government looking into what the opposition is doing, in a way, in which I pointe out earlier.

Top U.S. official visits Vietnam to assess human rights progress,"HANOI (Reuters) - A top U.S. envoy began a two-day trip to Vietnam on Monday to gauge its progress in human rights, two weeks ahead of a visit by President Barack Obama in what will be the first by a U.S. leader in a decade. Tom Malinowski, assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, is expected to press Vietnam to release unconditionally political prisoners and reform its laws to comply with its international commitments. Relations between the United States and Vietnam have moved to a new level in the past two years as Washington seeks to make a new ally in Asia, but the communist nation’s zero-tolerance approach to its detractors remains a sticking point. Vietnam has jailed dissidents, bloggers and religious figures in recent years, holding them for long periods without access to family or legal counsel and often subject to torture or other mistreatment, according to the New York-based Human Rights Watch. The United States has been intensifying efforts in building stronger ties -  in health, education, environment, energy and recently military - to boost its influence, and offset that of China. The United States and Vietnam, along with 10 others, this year signed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), one of the world’s biggest multinational trade deals. Though the TPP has no requirements for members to reach certain standards in human rights, analysts say Vietnam’s record of arrests, intimidation and oppression of those who speak out against the ruling Communist Party could add to anticipated resistance to the pact among U.S. legislators. The TPP must be ratified by each member country’s parliament. Malinowski said during his visit to Vietnam last year that he had seen signs of progress on human rights but the country needed to make a stronger commitment. Rights groups, however, say those improvements might be short-lived and designed to ensure its smooth accession to multilateral trade agreements, including a pact with the European Union.

 Obama Shuts Down Republicans Not Voting On SCOTUS Nominee With One Brilliant Tweet (IMAGES),"Regardless of what the U.S. Constitution says or what the American people are so clearly demanding, the GOP has decided to throw the rules out the window and refuse to hold hearings for any SCOTUS nominee Obama might choose. This is something that Republicans like Majority Leader of the Senate Mitch McConnell and GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz have been threatening to do since the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia   it s just mind blowing to see it actually happening.President Barack Obama has a presidential obligation to nominate a new Justice, and it is the Senate s job to take a vote on that choice, whether they like it or not. But instead, Senate Republicans are going to leave Scalia s seat empty for the next 340 days, completely disobeying the Constitution and insulting the democratic process. Here are the signatures of the GOP senators that decided they will refuse to vote on Obama s Supreme Court nominee and wait until a new president is in office to replace Scalia:LETTER:  this Committee will not hold hearings on any Supreme Court nominee  until 1/20/17 pic.twitter.com/rMKGkDOn58  Mike DeBonis (@mikedebonis) February 23, 2016It s a major  F*ck you  to Obama and the majority of Americans, who have made it clear that they support the President putting forth a nominee. This kind of resistance has never been seen before with any other presidents, as many historians and political figures have pointed out over the last week and a half.Obama knows it, too, and he hit back at the GOP with a brilliant tweet that summed up everyone s frustration with the situation: With more than 300 days left in President Obama s term, the Senate has no excuse to delay. #DoYourJob pic.twitter.com/ultmGstueA  Barack Obama (@BarackObama) February 23, 2016In his tweet, Obama reminded the GOP of just how ridiculous their delay was by showing them a gif of the number of days between previous Justice s nominations and confirmations. Noting that the Senate Republicans have a constitutional duty to vote on a nominee, Obama followed it with the ever-so-appropriate hashtag #DoYourJob and urged his 70 million+ followers to put pressure on the GOP to do the right thing.TwitterAlthough Obama has yet to select a nominee, the president has said that he will, and hopefully by then this awful back-and-forth with the GOP will have come to an end.

" Billionaire Richard Branson Breaks Silence About Trump, Exposes Truth About His ‘Temperament’ (TWEETS)","Up until this point, Mark Cuban has been one of the most outspoken billionaires going after Trump and begging America to vote for Hillary Clinton in November. Today, it seems like another business mogul is ready to join Cuban s cause and tell America to wake the hell up.Billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Group, has finally spoken out against Trump and has done so via a brutal statement on his company s website. His statement opened with something that most of us   especially Cuban   could agree with. Branson said: I want an entrepreneur to become president one day   just not Donald Trump. In railing against the disgraced GOP candidate, Branson didn t hold back in telling Americans that Trump is such a horrendous excuse for a candidate, that many of Branson s conservative wealthy colleagues cannot even bring themselves to vote for him, even though they may have voted Republican religiously in the past. Branson said: Quite a few of my American friends, especially some very successful entrepreneurs, are registered Republicans. They have told me they are unable to vote for Donald Trump due to his extreme views, and his shocking ignorance of policy. Branson continued to trash Trump while showering his opponent in compliments, stating that Clinton is a safe pair of hands and a leader of supreme experience and knowhow. TwitterThen, Branson got real on Trump s temperament, because apparently some people need to be reminded over and over again how dangerous it is to have a ticking time bomb with the maturity of a three-year-old in the White House: On the other hand, Mr Trump s temperament is irrational, aggressive and he lacks informed ideas on how to grow jobs in America. An entrepreneur president would put that at the heart of his plans and yet his fear-based campaign blames immigrants and open borders. America was built upon a collective embracing of diversity and openness   not division and close-mindedness. There are too many examples of Mr Trump s lack of empathy and respect to name. I agree with many on both sides of America s political aisle that he is unfit for office. TwitterBranson concluded by urging Americans to  make sure you vote for your future  and not be misled by uninformed, inflammatory remarks.

RINO MITCH McCONNELL Praises Hillary Day After Benghazi Hearing…Says He Could Work With Her As President,"Is there a law against waterboarding Republican Senators who continue to be re-elected even though it s pretty clear they should be running on the Democrat ticket Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) praised former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday   the day after the House Select Committee on Benghazi issued its final report.  She s an intelligent and capable person, no question about it,  McConnell told Time Warner Cable News, adding that he had worked well with her in the Senate and would be able to work with her as president.The Benghazi report details a pattern of incompetence, negligence, and dishonesty by Clinton and her associates. She failed to provide adequate security for U.S. diplomats in Benghazi; failed to take action to save U.S. personnel under attack on Sep. 11, 2012; and then falsely blamed an anti-Islamic YouTube video for inciting a protest that supposedly led to the attack.In addition, the Benghazi investigation uncovered the existence of Clinton s private email server, which violated State Department policies and may also have broken laws regarding the handling of classified information. Clinton seems to have used the server to evade Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, possibly in connection with fundraising for her family s private foundation while in office, including solicitations from foreign donors and governments. She has misled the public repeatedly about the email server, claiming falsely that she did not share classified information and that she had turned over all work-related emails to the government.Yet McConnell did not rule Clinton out. Instead, he said her presumptive Republican opponent, Donald Trump, had not yet proven himself qualified:Sen. Mitch McConnell:  Trump clearly needs to change, in my opinion, to win the general election. What I ve said to him both publicly and privately:  You re a great entertainer. You turn on audiences. You re good before a crowd. You have a lot of Twitter followers. That worked fine for you in the primaries. But now that you are in the general, people are looking for a level of seriousness that is typically conveyed by having a prepared text and Teleprompter and staying on message.  So my hope is that he is beginning to pivot and become what I would call a more serious and credible candidate for the highest office in the land. Geoff Bennett:  At the moment, though, I hear you saying he does not meet that threshold of credibility? McConnell:  He s getting closer. Getting closer. Via: Breitbart ",left-news,"Jun 30, 2016",1

WATCH HILLARY SQUIRM When Mainstream Media Asks If She Plans To Watch “13 Hours” Movie,"Hillary was too busy to be bothered with making Benghazi a safer place for Ambassador Stevens, so it should really come as no surprise that she s too busy to watch  13 HOURS,  the true story of Benghazi. By the way, whoever told Hillary that calling the families of the four men killed in Benghazi  liars,  just as the true story of what really happened under her watch is coming out in theaters nationwide, should be fired One of the enduring mysteries of the Benghazi tragedy is why anyone ever took seriously Hillary Clinton s blaming some obscure maker of a YouTube video for the attack. That mystery, however, is dwarfed by the way the media try to pretend that Hillary s denials of that happening are anything other than bald-faced (that bald-face would be pasty white, wrinkled, and bewhiskered). In testimony elicited by the Benghazi Committee and in released emails, it has become apparent that no one ever thought the video was to blame and Clinton has, herself, attempted to claim that she never blamed the video.Now there is a new  wrinkle  to the story. Hillary told the families that the video was the cause of the attack that led to the deaths of their family members. Now she is saying they are lying.First, there is her statement when she, shamelessly, stood in the hangar at Dover AFB as the bodies of the dead men returned home:CLINTON: Many others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We ve seen the heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We ve seen rage and violence directed at American embassies over an awful Internet video that we had nothing to do with.Then we have the families themselves:Transcript via TownhallTyrone Woods  father (who took notes about their meeting):  I gave Hillary a hug and shook her hand. And she said we are going to have the film maker arrested who was responsible for the death of my son She said   the filmmaker who was responsible for the death of your son Sean Smith s mother:  She s absolutely lying. She told me something entirely different at the casket ceremony. She said it was because of the video. Sean Smith s uncle:  Mrs. Clinton really has a problem embracing the truth. Glen Doherty s sister:  When I think back now to that day and what she knew, it shows me a lot about her character that she would choose in that moment to basically perpetuate what she knew was untrue. On ABC s This Week, Clinton family retainer, George Stephanopoulos, revisited the issue   I have no idea why other than some misbegotten effort to  set the record straight    and got this response:https://youtu.be/jAUDS-aLGjISTEPHANOPOULOS: Did you tell them it was about the film? And what s your response?CLINTON: No. You know, look I understand the continuing grief at the loss that parents experienced with the loss of these four brave Americans. And I did testify, as you know, for 11 hours. And I answered all of these questions. Now, I can t   I can t help it the people think there has to be something else there. I said very clearly there had been a terrorist group, uh, that had taken responsibility on Facebook, um, between the time that, uh, I   you know, when I talked to my daughter, that was the latest information; we were, uh, giving it credibility. And then we learned the next day it wasn t true. In fact, they retracted it. This was a fast-moving series of events in the fog of war and I think most Americans understand that.So we have Hillary blaming the video at the arrival of the caskets. We have all four families agreeing that they were told it was a video. We have Hillary on record blaming the video in the week after the attack. And now she says it never happened.This woman is a pathological liar. The sad thing is that she could probably pass a lie detector test. Via: Red State ",politics,"Jan 17, 2016",1
Ousted Turkish beauty queen may face jail time over tweet,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A former Turkish beauty pageant winner may face up to a year in prison over a tweet referring to last year s failed military coup that cost her  Miss Turkey  title, the private Dogan news agency said on Thursday. An Istanbul prosecutor has indicted 18-year-old Itir Esen, who in September was stripped of her title after one day, for  publicly humiliating a segment of the society  following three official complaints over her tweet, Dogan reported. On July 16 this year, Esen tweeted:  I had my period on July 15 morning to celebrate the day to commemorate martyrs. As a representation of our martyrs  blood, I am commemorating this day by bleeding.  She later deleted the tweet and deactivated her Twitter account. Dogan said the indictment included a statement by Esen in which she said her tweet was shared in an ironic way to commemorate those who died on July 15, 2016 and there was no intent to insult any part of Turkish society.    Around 250 people, mostly unarmed civilians were killed and over 1,000 wounded in the failed coup bid on July 15, 2016. The day was later declared Democracy and National Unity Day and a public holiday in Turkey. More than 150,000 state employees have been suspended or sacked and over 50,000 have been jailed pending trial in a security crackdown following the attempted coup. Rights groups and some of NATO-member Turkey s Western allies have voiced disquiet about the crackdown, fearing the government is using the coup as a pretext to quash dissent.

No rehearing for ex-Illinois Governor Blagojevich; appeal planned,"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Monday refused to reconsider its recent decision upholding former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich’s corruption conviction and 14-year prison term. The order from the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago likely ends Blagojevich’s chance for a new trial or shorter sentence unless he can persuade the U.S. Supreme Court to take up his case, a long shot. Leonard Goodman, a lawyer for Blagojevich, in an interview said his client will appeal to the Supreme Court. “The issues are important not just for Mr. Blagojevich and his family, which never used the office to enrich themselves—and yet he is serving one of the longest sentences issued to a governor—but also to every elected official who is not independently wealthy and has to raise campaign funds,” Goodman said. In its April 21 decision, the appeals court rejected arguments that Blagojevich deserved leniency because of his good behavior during his five years in prison, and because parts of his original 2011 conviction had been thrown out. Prosecutors accused Blagojevich of soliciting campaign money in exchange for raising pediatric reimbursement rates and legislation supporting Illinois’ horse racing industry. They said he also tried to sell or trade the U.S. Senate seat that Barack Obama, a fellow Democrat, vacated after winning the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Blagojevich, 60, was convicted on charges including wire fraud, extortion and soliciting bribes while governor, a job he held from January 2003 to January 2009 before being removed from office. He is eligible for release from prison in May 2024. ",politicsNews,"June 5, 2017 ",0
U.S. military to indefinitely delay ban on cluster bombs,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon will indefinitely delay a ban on the use of older types of cluster bombs due to take effect on Jan. 1, 2019, officials said, arguing that safety improvements in munitions technology failed to advance enough to replace older stockpiles. Cluster bombs, dropped by air or fired by artillery, scatter bomblets across a wide area, but sometimes fail to explode and are difficult to locate and remove. That can lead to civilian deaths and injuries long after conflicts end. The U.S. military had hoped to transition to cluster munitions that explode at least 99 percent of time, greatly reducing the risks.  But with just over one year to go before the ban’s slated implementation, a Pentagon spokesman told Reuters that safety technology had not progressed enough to replace existing stockpiles with safer weaponry.  Reuters has seen a copy of the memo changing U.S. policy and confirmed the changes with Pentagon officials. “Although the Department seeks to field a new generation of more highly reliable munitions, we cannot risk mission failure or accept the potential of increased military and civilian casualties by forfeiting the best available capabilities,” the Pentagon memo says. The memo, which was expected to be signed by Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan on Thursday, called cluster munitions “legitimate weapons with clear military utility.” Disclosure of the new policy met sharp criticism from Congress and human rights groups. Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat who has helped lead efforts to restrict use of cluster bombs, said the Pentagon was, in effect, “perpetuating use of an indiscriminate weapon that has been shown to have high failure rates.”  Senator Dianne Feinstein called the move “unbelievable.” Human Rights Watch disputed the idea that the U.S. military needed the weapons, saying that with the exception of a single strike in Yemen in 2009 it had not used the weapons since 2003 in Iraq. “We condemn this decision to reverse the long-held US commitment not to use cluster munitions that fail more than 1 percent of the time, resulting in deadly unexploded submunitions,” said Mary Wareham, arms division director at Human Rights Watch. Pentagon spokesman Tom Crosson acknowledged it has been years since the U.S. military has used any significant amount of cluster munitions and the new Pentagon policy puts emphasis on eventually shifting to safer cluster munitions. Still, it was unclear at what point in the future the Pentagon might be required to stop using its existing stockpiles, since there would also need to be not just higher-tech weaponry, but sufficient quantities of new cluster munitions for U.S. stocks.      The new policy does not allow the Pentagon to buy any additional cluster bombs that do not satisfy new standards that were outlined in the memo. The new rules broaden the definition of which types of munitions meet safety requirements beyond the 99 percent detonation rate. Under the new policy, the Pentagon says bombs that have advanced self destruct or deactivation technology would also be acceptable for future acquisition.  Such weaponry must meet a series of criteria, including having a way to render submunitions inoperable within 15 minutes of being armed. The Pentagon policy also prohibited purchasing weaponry that is banned under the Convention on Cluster Munitions.  The convention strictly prohibits the use of cluster munitions. But it exempts certain types of munitions that the Pentagon says it would nonetheless classify as cluster munitions. ",politicsNews,"November 30, 2017 ",0

 WATCH: An Atheist Just HUMILIATED A Creationist While Debating Evolution In Front Of Noah’s Ark Museum,"A creationist tried to debate an atheist about evolution and he got owned within seconds.Outside the recently opened Noah s Ark museum in Kentucky, which took $18 million from taxpayers in violation of the separation of church and state, protesters gathered to counter the bullshit creation story that Ken Ham is trying to shove down everyone s throats.Noted atheist Aron Ra joined the protesters and was soon challenged to a debate on evolution by creationist Eric Hovind, a fundamentalist Christian who agrees with Ham that the Earth is only 6,000 years old and that dinosaurs and humans existed at the same time despite all the science that proves otherwise.Conservative  Christians  like Hovind and Ham reject evolution science and advocate for teaching creationism in science class in order to indoctrinate kids into Christianity against their will.But after the way Hovind got his ass handed to him by science during this encounter on Thursday, it s clear why creationism should never be taught in schools. There are hundreds of state-funded museums around the world teaching the religion of evolution,  Hovind whined even though evolution is science, not religion.One protester pointed out that those state-funded museums do not discriminate against against people seeking employment the way the Ark museum discriminates against anyone who isn t a Christian who shares their beliefs.Ra responded by noting that unlike creationism, evolution is  demonstrable verifiable science. Hovind s only comeback was to continue branding evolution a  religious worldview. Ra made sure everyone present knew that Hovind s only defense of his beliefs is to tell lies about evolution.Hovind then asked the question that got him owned. Do you believe we came from an ape-like ancestor?  Hovind demanded to know.At this point, Ra used science as a club and beat Hovind over the head with it. Apes don t have tails   learn taxonomy!  Ra said to cheers from the crowd.  So yes, you are an ape, by definition. In fact, he s absolutely right. As Raw Story explained:From a biological standpoint, apes are a classification of anthropoid primates that don t have tails. There are two different families of apes: Hylobatidae and Hominidae. The Hominidae branch includes orangutans, gorillas  and, yes, humans.With no other way to counter Ra, Hovind and his band of thugs resorted to accusing Ra of sounding like Hitler, which pretty much means Hovind knows he got beat.Here s the video via Facebook.The bottom line is that Earth is billions of years old and dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago before humans arrived on the scene. Stunts like the Ark park are efforts by organized religion to brainwash kids.Taxpayer dollars should never have been used to help build this abomination and quite frankly it should open the door for the government to finally tax the churches. Because if churches can receive tax dollars to help them push their bullshit, they should have to pay taxes in return.Featured image via screen capture",News,"July 7, 2016",1
"TEAM CLINTON MEMBER BILL GATES Pushed For Unlimited Guest Worker Permits Last Week…This Week Slashes 18,000 Jobs"," The question is not how Hillary will ever be able to repay the kindness of so many donors to the Clinton Slush Fund/Clinton Charity the question is how will America survive her pay-backs?According to donation records, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation   which funds global vaccine distribution   has donated at least $26 million to the Clinton charity, though records appear to be incomplete so the amount could be higher.On Thursday, a week after former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates argued for amnesty and for an unlimited number of high-tech guest-worker visas, Microsoft announced it would slash 18,000 jobs. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella promised his employees that  we will go through this process in the most thoughtful and transparent way possible.  Analysts told USA Today that the number being let go was  larger than expected. The  vast majority  of employees will reportedly be notified  within the next six months  and  earn severance and job transition help in many locations.  Microsoft employs 125,000 people.Bill Gates, along with Sheldon Adelson and Warren Buffett, advocated removing  the worldwide cap on the number of visas that could be awarded to legal immigrants who had earned a graduate degree in science, technology, engineering or mathematics from an accredited institution of higher education in the United States. However, numerous nonpartisan scholars and studies have determined that there is a surplus   not a shortage   of American high-tech workers. Moreover, after a recent Census report found that  74% of those with a bachelor s degree in these subjects don t work in STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) jobs,  the mainstream media may finally be catching on and taking away the high-tech industry s  free pass.  CBS News, for instance, concluded that the Census data suggest the high-tech industry s contention that there is a shortage of American high-tech  is largely a myth. Ron Hira, a public policy professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology, has  said there are 50% more graduates than job openings in the STEM fields.  Microsoft s announcement hammers home his point that the IT sector has often been  an area of social mobility,  and removing the caps on high-tech guest-worker visas would take jobs away from American workers and make it more difficult to climb the economic ladder. You ve got people who come from working-class backgrounds who go into these sectors,  Hira said on a conference call of scholars earlier this year that Sen. Jeff Sessions'(R-AL) office organized.

Trump attends 'Villains and Heroes' costume party dressed as...himself,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump attended a “Villains and Heroes” costume party at a major donor’s Long Island home on Saturday night, but declined to don any garb that was in keeping with the theme. Trump entered the party hosted by the Mercer family, one of his biggest donors, at their home in the village of Head of the Harbor in St. James, N.Y., wearing a suit and a blue and white checked tie. Security guards at the event however were dressed as biker gang members Hell’s Angels. Trump walked into the home and gave reporters, who were not  allowed inside, the thumbs up and posed briefly for photos, but did not respond to questions except to mouth “me,” pointing to himself when asked who he was dressed as. Trump spoke briefly at the party, thanking the Mercer family, according to a member of his press team, staying for just under two hours. It was his only outing from his Manhattan home on Saturday. Early on Sunday, he slammed the latest “Saturday Night Live” on Twitter, calling it “unwatchable”. “Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can’t get any worse. Sad,” Trump wrote about Alec Baldwin’s recurring appearances on the late night sketch show in which the actor portrays Trump. None of Trump’s immediate family members attended the Long Island party, but his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, was on hand, dressed as Super Woman. Trump’s designated White House strategist Steve Bannon was also on hand, but appeared not to be in costume. Music by Adele, Lady Gaga, Shakira, Sia and Céline Dion emanated from the Christmas light decorated home. A wifi network set up for the party used the password “HeroesWin!” Robert Mercer, the billionaire at whose mansion on Long Island’s tony North Shore the party was held, is co-chief executive of Renaissance Technologies, a hedge fund. Daughter Rebekah Mercer sits on Trump’s transition team. Trump is in the midst of choosing cabinet members. Mercer initially supported Ted Cruz for the Republican nomination before putting his support behind Trump in the November presidential election.    ",politicsNews,"December 4, 2016 ",0
Spy chiefs tell U.S. lawmakers plan to share raw data protects privacy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American spy chiefs have told congressmen that a plan to allow the National Security Agency (NSA) to share more raw eavesdropping reports with other agencies will not be unlawful and will protect the privacy rights of U.S. citizens. In a letter sent on Monday to two members of Congress and reviewed by Reuters, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said the NSA’s proposal to give other spy agencies access to “unevaluated signals intelligence” will ensure data is used only for intelligence activities directed at foreigners. Last week, U.S. Representatives Ted Lieu and Blake Farenthold of the House Oversight Committee asked the NSA to halt the sharing plan, suggesting it would be “unconstitutional and dangerous.” The specifics of the proposal are still secret. Lieu, a Democrat from California and Farenthold, a Republican from Texas, wrote in a March 21 letter to NSA Director Michael Rogers that the proposal would violate Fourth Amendment privacy protections because the collected data would not require a warrant before being searched for domestic law enforcement purposes. Monday’s reply from the intelligence chief’s office said the plan would not allow the use of communications data for domestic law enforcement. Instead, the proposed rules would limit access to raw NSA data to spy agencies, “and only for authorized foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes,” said the letter. It said it would also not authorize any new collection of private communications. Civil liberties advocates have interpreted the proposed change as potentially allowing NSA foreign intelligence data, which sometimes can include collection of communications to, from or about Americans, to be used for domestic policing purposes. Under current procedures, NSA analysts are supposed to scrub or black out certain personal information, particularly related to American citizens or residents, before handing any communications data over to other agencies. Congress last year passed a law curtailing certain aspects of the NSA’s spying authority, most notably ending its bulk collection of domestic phone records exposed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013. NSA began that program after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States by Islamist militants. The NSA has presented the plan to a government advisory committee, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, for review. ",politicsNews,"March 29, 2016 ",0
U.S. attorney general due to face Democrats' Russia questions next week,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is due to testify before a congressional committee next week, three sources familiar with the matter said on Monday, offering Democrats a chance to question him about his past statements on President Donald Trump’s campaign exchanges with Russian intermediaries. Sessions’ testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, which has not been publicly announced, was confirmed by a Justice Department spokesman and two congressional aides. The open hearing, tentatively scheduled for Nov. 14, is part of the committee’s regular oversight of the Justice Department, but Russia appears almost certain to be a topic. Separately, Sessions is due to appear in a closed session before the House Intelligence Committee on Nov. 14, a source familiar with that panel’s plans said.  Senate Democrats last week demanded that Sessions be recalled to testify on the Trump campaign’s Russia contacts after the disclosure of an effort to set up a meeting between then-Republican candidate Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. That, they said, conflicted with Sessions’ earlier statements to Congress. The effort to set up a Trump-Putin meeting - which never took place - was disclosed in court documents filed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election and whether there was collusion between Trump aides and the Kremlin. According to the documents, George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser, said at a March 31, 2016, meeting of Trump foreign policy advisers “that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and President Putin.” Both Sessions and Trump attended that meeting, according to a photo posted on Trump’s Instagram account. Democrats want to question Sessions because, in October, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee that a continuing exchange between the Trump campaign and Russian government intermediaries “did not happen, at least not to my knowledge and not with me.” Sessions has denied misleading congressional committees about his interactions regarding Russia. He had to recuse himself from investigations into the alleged Russian interference after it was revealed in March that he met with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak at least twice in 2016. J.D. Gordon, a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser who was at the March 2016 meeting, told Reuters that Papadopoulos indeed “made a pitch for meeting with Putin.” But Sessions shot the idea down, Gordon said. “Yes, within minutes. He was quite clear. We thought that was the end of it.” Papadopoulos continued trying to arrange contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, the court filings say.

Senate kills family-planning rule; Pence breaks tie,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Vice President Mike Pence took the rare step of breaking a tie in the U.S. Senate on Thursday, casting the deciding vote to roll back protections for reproductive health funds.  Using the Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to repeal recently minted regulations, senators killed a rule intended to keep federal grants flowing to clinics that provide contraception and other services in states that want to block the funding. The rule was enacted in the final weeks of former President Barack Obama’s administration, giving lawmakers the opening to nullify it under the review law. In recent years states such as Texas have kept some healthcare providers from receiving the grants as part of the country’s longstanding fight over abortion.  It was the second time on Thursday that Pence used his role as the chamber’s president to end a deadlock. He was called to the capitol earlier to carry the resolution through a procedural vote.  Saying the rule usurps states’ rights, Republicans argued local lawmakers should decide how healthcare money is distributed.  Their main concern is that federal money is being used to provide abortions, although the grants are specifically barred from funding those procedures. Republicans, including President Donald Trump, generally oppose abortion. “This regulation is an unnecessary restriction on states that know their residents’ own needs best,” said Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Democrats said the resolution was an attack on women’s health, contending the rollback will make it harder for low-income and rural women to obtain screenings for cancer and other diseases, as well as contraception. Most resolutions killing recent Obama-era regulations have sailed through the Republican-controlled Congress. They need to win only simple majorities in both chambers to go to the president for signing. The congressional review law was used only once successfully until this year. The family-planning resolution marked the 13th time it has been deployed effectively since the beginning of February, as well as the first time a resolution has come within a hair’s breadth of failing. “Republicans didn’t listen to us,” said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the health committee. “They didn’t listen to women across the country who made it clear that restricting women’s access to the full range of reproductive care is unacceptable.”  The nonprofit Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions  and many other health and contraception services, receives some of the federal funding.  Noting the recent collapse of the Republican healthcare bill in the U.S. House of Representatives, Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said Thursday’s votes were close because “people are sick and tired of politicians making it even harder for them to access healthcare.” ",politicsNews,"March 30, 2017 ",0
"U.S. Air Force Runs Out Of Bombs To Drop On ISIS…Don’t Worry Though, Barry’s Got This","Bombs a-w oh, never mind Things must be going well in the  war on terror,  as the US Air Force just admitted that it is fast running out of bombs to drop on ISIS after  B-1s have dropped bombs in record numbers.  As ZeeNews reports, Air Force chief of staff General Mark Welsh said as America ramps up its military campaign against the Islamist terror group, the Air Force is now  expending munitions faster than we can replenish them. The US Air Force is fast running out of bombs to drop on ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq after its pilots fired off over 20,000 missiles and bombs since the US bombing campaign against the terror group began 15 months ago, its chief has said. As ZeeNews reports, B-1s have dropped bombs in record numbers. F-15Es are in the fight because they are able to employ a wide range of weapons and do so with great flexibility. We need the funding in place to ensure we re prepared for the long fight,  Welsh said in the statement. This is a critical need,  he said.The bombing campaign has left the US Air Force with what an Air Force official described as munitions depot stocks  below our desired objective. The Air Force has requested additional funding for Hellfire missiles and is developing plans to ramp up weapons production to replenish its stocks more quickly. But replenishing that stock can take  up to four years from time of expenditure to asset resupply,  the official told CNN. The precision today s wars requires demands the right equipment and capability to achieve desired effects. We need to ensure the necessary funding is in place to not only execute today s wars, but also tomorrow s challenges,  the official said. As The Washington Times concludes, Russia has been bombing ISIS positions sporadically while France and Great Britain are now active in the American-led coalition which could relieve some pressure.Much larger potential adversaries like Russia or China most surely are following this development carefully. If the USAF cannot sustain a trickling battle against a poorly armed, medieval enemy, fighting a superpower military is obviously beyond its capability.Via: Zero Hedge",left-news,"Dec 7, 2015",1
Kenya court awards 4 million shillings to girl strip-searched by police,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - A Kenyan court on Monday awarded a young woman four million shillings in damages after she was strip-searched by police who said they were looking for drugs. The incident in August 2015 provoked an outcry in the East African country after images of the half-naked 18-year-old schoolgirl were posted on social media. She pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana shortly after the incident and was sentenced to 18 months on probation. In the lawsuit she later filed jointly with a child rights group, the young woman said the photos humiliated her and sought legal compensation.  Kenyan high court judge John Mativo said in his ruling that the student was entitled to the four million shillings ($38,815) because her constitutional rights to dignity had been violated. The student had been traveling with more than 40 others on a bus home for the holidays when she was stopped by the police.  The court s ruling is a rare victory in the East African country s legal system against the police. Although no police officers were tried or found guilty in the case, the ruling was an acknowledgment of wrongdoing.  A government civilian body exists to oversee the police, but few officers are charged and convictions are extremely rare. ",worldnews,"December 18, 2017 ",0
 Is Gabby Giffords Being Sued By Her Shooter? (IMAGES),"Former Representative Gabby Giffords has made a remarkable recovery after suffering a gunshot wound to the head five years ago, but now she is possibly being sued by her attacker.On January 8, 2011, Giffords was speaking to a group of her constituents outside of a Safeway in Casas Adobes, Arizona when Jared Lee Loughner began firing on the crowd. Loughner s bullets killed six people and injured thirteen, including Giffords. The shooter was detained by people at the event and later pleaded guilty to 19 charges related to the shooting   he is currently serving seven consecutive life sentences in prison.However, although he admitted to his crimes and was sentenced accordingly, a lawsuit has allegedly been filed by Loughner against the former congresswoman for $25 million for psychological and emotional distress. It claims claims that he is innocent and was hand-picked  to be an assassin. My incarceration is illegal. I am actually innocent. I was Framed. I am a victim of project mk-ultra the govt. put a chip in my head to control my mind .Gabby Giffords is in the Illuminati and I have evidence of this I was handpicked illegally to be a sleeper assassin. MY HEAD is full of chips and this evil empire govt is controlling me within. The lawsuit claims all sorts of other insane things, as well. It says that he has been waterboarded repeatedly during his incarceration by the ATF, NSA and CIA. The suit also alleges that his attorney is a  global spy  who forced him to plead guilty and that authorities are making him sick from  microwave testing  and  chemtrails.  It even accuses Giffords of funding the San Bernardino shooters.The timing of this lawsuit has made some people think that it is a hoax. Just days before it was filed, a similar lawsuit was filed in Michigan against Uber, supposedly by the Kalamazoo mass shooter, Jason Brian Dalton. That lawsuit turned out to be fake and apparently the Giffords  suit looks a lot like the Dalton suit. Tucson News reports:The envelopes of both the alleged Loughner lawsuit and the fake Dalton lawsuit have very similar characteristics.Both have the same three stamps in the top right corner, have similar handwriting and are postmarked in Philadelphia, PA.The envelopes, do indeed look very similar and when you read Loughner s alleged lawsuit there seems to be a whole lot of crazy crammed into it.

The woman now risks permanent damage to her hearing after being punched in the head.Saturday night a young couple were attacked by up to five people  of other ethnic origin  in Silkeborg, reports BT.The attack took place outside a pizza restaurant in Silkeborg, where a 24-year-old woman and her boyfriend sat while eating a pizza.The perpetrator took one of her pieces of pizza and threw it on the ground, which developed into a scuffle, and soon after the perpetrator got help from a group of friends who ganged up on the couple and attacked them with several punches and kicks.Midtjyllands Avis writes that the young couple were asked if there was pork on their pizza, which they answered yes to. And it was apparently what triggered the brawl. Suddenly a young man of other ethnic origin rushed towards the young woman and hit her in the head, so that she has subsequently lost the hearing on one ear. Right now we do not know whether it is a permanent hearing damage! He then takes a stranglehold on her and shouting that she sure as hell should not eat pork on her pizza,  writes the mother of the young man in a post on Facebook that the newspaper has seen.Mid and West Jutland Police describe the main offender as about 175 cm high, ethnic origin other than Danish, and wearing dark clothing.

LIBERALS FREAK OUT! Trump Wipes Out One Of Obama’s Most Controversial Executive Actions…Gives Rights Back To States [VIDEO],"Top officials from the Justice Department and the Education Department joined forces to write a letter rejecting the Obama administration s policy on the nondiscrimination laws and supporting the rollback of the policy. They explained their belief that the directive was improperly devised,  without due regard for the primary role of the states and local school districts in establishing educational policy. This dispute is putting the President in the middle of transgender rights issues, which he expressed his general sympathy for during the campaign. This is an issue that continues to split the republican party and the nation.Despite his personal sympathies, though, the President has made it clear that he believes this should be a states rights issue. Keeping the federal government in its proper place is another issue that Trump promised to address during his time in office, and he seems to be keeping his promise.The Washington Examiner reported that White House press secretary Sean Spicer confirmed that the President wants to leave this to the states to decide:  It s a state s rights issue, and that s entirely what he believes,  Spicer said.  If a state wants to pass a rule or a law   that s their right. But, it shouldn t be the federal government getting in the way of this. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has resisted this change in the past, saying that she is uncomfortable pushing an issue that could bring harm to transgender students.Via The New York Times:  Ms. DeVos s unease was evident in a strongly worded statement she released on Wednesday night, in which she said she considered it a  moral obligation  for every school in America to protect all students from discrimination, bullying and harassment.Gay rights protesters have come out en mass to chant and protest for their rights to use the bathroom of their choice.

NEW REPORT: OBAMAPHONE Program Stashed $9 BILLION In Private Bank Accounts…Exposes Massive Windfall For Phone Companies,"Who could forget the  Obamaphone Lady  from Cleveland, OH, who unashamedly told an interviewer she was voting for Obama because all minorities in Cleveland get a free Obamaphone from Obama, and  He s gonna do more!  She actually woke up and admitted that she, and other minorities had been played by Obama in a follow-up video at the bottom of the page.The controversial  Obamaphone  program, which pays for cellphones for the poor, is rife with fraud, according to a new government report released Thursday that found more than a third of enrollees may not even be qualified.Known officially as the Lifeline Program, the phone giveaway became a symbol of government waste in the previous administration. Now a new report from the Government Accountability Office bears out those concerns.The report, requested by Sen. Claire McCaskill, Missouri Democrat, also says the program has stashed some $9 billion in assets in private bank accounts rather than with the federal treasury, further increasing risks and depriving taxpayers of the full benefit of that money. A complete lack of oversight is causing this program to fail the American taxpayer   everything that could go wrong is going wrong,  said Mrs. McCaskill, ranking Democrat on the Senate s chief oversight committee and who is a former state auditor in Missouri. We re currently letting phone companies cash a government check every month with little more than the honor system to hold them accountable, and that simply can t continue,  she said. The program, run by the Federal Communications Commission, predates President Obama, but it gained attention during his administration when recipients began to associate the free phone with other benefits he doled out to the poor.   Washington TimesThe Daily Caller reported:A massive portion of Obamaphone recipients are receiving the benefit after lying on their applications, according to a new 90-page report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO).An undercover sting operation showed ineligible applications were approved 63 percent of the time, and a review that found that 36 to 65 percent of beneficiaries in various categories had lied in easily-detectable ways but were approved anyway.The fraud reached unheard-of proportions because the Federal Communications Commission let the task of screening for eligibility fall to phone companies that profit off of enrolling as many people as possible.GAO undercover investigators applied for free government phones 19 times using criteria that should have been rejected, and  we were approved to receive Lifeline services by 12 of the 19 Lifeline providers using fictitious eligibility documentation. All someone has to do to apply for free cell phone service is say that they are on another welfare program, such as food stamps or disability, known as SSI.When Congress considered reforms, phone companies took out daily full-page ads in publications read by Capitol Hill staffers. The wife of the CEO of TracFone, the largest beneficiary of Obamaphones, was a mega-fundraiser for former President Barack Obama.The cause of the fraud rates, shocking even by federal government standards, was always clear: The FCC allowed companies with a profit motive to sign up as many people as possible to determine eligibility.Phone companies swooped into housing projects in vans with neon flashing lights to register users. A woman approached by one such representative outside of a welfare office told The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group the man encouraged her to enroll her two-year-old.The companies weren t checking eligibility, and the FCC wasn t ensuring they did or punishing those who didn t. Additionally, the FCC failed to provide many companies with the intra-government databases that would give them the ability to perform some checks, the GAO found.The Obamaphone Lady aka Michelle Dowry made an appearance on Alex Jones  show where she admitted to finally waking up, as she discovered that Barack Obama s presidency was a giant hoax. The only thing that Michele and the rest of the the minority community Obama promised to help got during his 8 years in office was a tax-payer funded  free  phone:",politics,"Jul 5, 2017",1
"OBAMA’S DOJ LET Russian Lawyer Into U.S. WITHOUT A VISA Under “Extraordinary Circumstances” Before She Met With Donald Trump Jr…Lawyer Has Ties To Left-Wing Democrat Activist, Major Hillary Supporter","In July of 2016, Donald Trump, Jr. met a 42-year-old Russian attorney named Natalia Veselnitskaya who had promised him damaging information about then-candidate Hillary Clinton. One of his father s contacts, a music publicist named Rob Goldstone, had arranged the meeting as a favor to a client of his, the Azeri real estate developer and pop singer Emin. Goldstone had worked with the Trumps on the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow. There were other reasons to take the meeting, too: Emin s father, Aras Agalarov, is the 51st-richest man in Russia and an instrumental figure in the President s aborted foray into Russian real estate: the Moscow tower he tried and failed to erect.Trump Jr. has said he knew absolutely nothing about Veselnitskaya before their meeting, not even her name. She turned out to use the promise of information that could help his father s campaign as a pretext to discuss reinstating a popular Russian-American adoption program, according to his version of events. What could be more harmless?In fact, Veselnitskaya was already a key figure for the defense in one of the most notorious money-laundering scandals in recent memory, encompassing $230 million in public funds allegedly stolen from the Russians by a network of corrupt bureaucrats and routed into real estate sales, including some in Manhattan, through ironclad Swiss bank accounts. And she was accused of lobbying U.S. officials for a Russian NGO that sought to overturn the Russian ban on U.S. adoptions, according to a complaint filed with the U.S. Justice Department and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA).-TPMThe Hill -The Russian lawyer who penetrated Donald Trump s inner circle was initially cleared into the United States by the Justice Department under  extraordinary circumstances  before she embarked on a lobbying campaign last year that ensnared the president s eldest son, members of Congress, journalists and State Department officials, according to court and Justice Department documents and interviews.This revelation means it was the Obama Justice Department that enabled the newest and most intriguing figure in the Russia-Trump investigation to enter the country without a visa.Later, a series of events between an intermediary for the attorney and the Trump campaign ultimately led to the controversy surrounding Donald Trump Jr.Just five days after meeting in June 2016 at Trump Tower with Trump Jr., Trump s son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Moscow attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya showed up in Washington in the front row of a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Russia policy, video footage of the hearing shows.Veselnitskaya also attended a dinner with the chairman of the House subcommittee overseeing Russia policy, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) and roughly 20 other guests at a dinner club frequented by Republicans.Rohrabacher said he believed Veselnitskaya and her U.S. colleagues, which included former Rep. Ronald Dellums (D-Calif.), were lobbying other lawmakers to reverse the Magnitsky Act and restore the ability of Americans to adopt Russian children that Moscow had suspended.Daily Caller   Radical left-wing icon former California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums was a hired lobbyist for Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. June 9, 2016, the Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group has learned.Dellums, who represented liberal San Francisco and Oakland, Calif., is a long-time darling of left-wing political activists. He served 13 terms in Congress as an African-American firebrand and proudly called himself a socialist. He retired in 1996.The former congressman is one of several high-profile Democratic partisans who was on Veselnitskaya s payroll, working to defeat a law that is the hated object of a personal vendetta waged by Russian President Vladimir Putin.Former Democratic Congressman and Oakland, CA Mayor Ronald Dellums endorsed Hillary Clinton for President against Barack Obama in 2008:Ronald Dellums endorsed Hillary again in 2016. I don t think this was very heavily lobbied at all compared with the other issues we deal with,  Rohrabacher said.As for his former congressional colleague Dellums, Rohrabacher said he recalled having a conversation about the Magnitsky Act and the adoption issue:  Ron and I like each other   I have to believe he was a hired lobbyist but I don t know. Here s how Veselnitskaya is tied to the massive 2013 money laundering scheme and the controversial piece of legislation: 2012 s Magnitsky Act that involved Denis Katsyv, the son of Russian railroad baron Petr Katsyv and owner of the Prevezon group. It was the Magnitsky Act that Veselnitskaya allegedly discussed in her meeting with Donald Trump Jr.:TPM    In 2013, Veselnitskaya agreed to represent Denis Katsyv, The younger Katsyv was accused of collaborating with corrupt Russian officials in the money-laundering scheme. Then-U.S. attorney and  Sheriff of Wall Street  Preet Bharara (who was appointed US Attorney in Manhattan by Barack Obama and was fired by President Trump in March) led the charge against Prevezon; the company, his office said, had used cash from the theft to buy condos in Bharara s jurisdiction.Katsyv had been Veselnitskaya s highest-profile client by far, and his defense would be a world-historic success not just for the wealthy real estate investor, but for the Russian establishment under President Vladimir Putin.Until this weekend, the closest Veselnitskaya had come to the public eye was as a footnote to the compounding scandal of the Prevezon affair. Veselnitskaya had come to the United States with Katsyv, who was to be deposed by Bharara s team. Not only wasn t she deposed herself, she didn t attend her client s deposition in person. But after the deposition, she moved to the Plaza Hotel for the remaining two nights of her stay at a cost of $995 per night. Her firm then billed the U.S. government for the entire stay, as well as a single meal for five that included eight grappas, two bottles of wine, eighteen dishes and a bill that came to nearly $800. The group s total expenses topped $50,000, and they promised to file more.The legal proceedings in which Veselnitskaya was enmeshed contain a spy novel s-worth of twists, turns and tragic, suspicious accidents. Sergei Magnitsky, a whistleblowing accountant who called attention to Russian bureaucrats  alleged widespread embezzlement, was arrested and detained without trial for nearly a year until his death in 2009 from what prison staff described as  pancreonecrosis, ruptured abdominal membrane and toxic shock,  according to the U.S. government s suit against Prevezon. The Russian Interior Ministry later revised the cause of death to heart failure. When Magnitsky s family examined his body, they found bruises and that his fingers had been broken, according to an early draft of a report by then-president Dmitry Medvedev s own investigative committee.The incident led to a controversial piece of legislation: 2012 s Magnitsky Act, which sanctioned 18 Russian officials believed by the US to have been involved in Magnitsky s death. Five days later, the Russian parliament voted to ban adoptions of Russian children by Americans, a move understood to be retaliation for the Magnitsky Act. Putin, by that time president of Russia again, also began to compile an  anti-Magnitsky  list of his own, according to the New York Times. Bharara was among the prominent names on it.Magnitsky s death, and the original theft by Russian bureaucrats, are believed by many, including Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), to be the work of the Klyuev Group, a network of criminals working in the Russian government to enrich themselves at the expense of Russian citizens (its exploits are chronicled in English in a number of articles by reporter Michael Weiss). Magnitsky and others sought to expose what they believed was hundreds of millions of dollars  worth of graft by the group.The suit against Prevezon never went to trial. On March 11, Donald Trump fired Bharara, and on March 21, Nikolai Gorokhov, the Magnitsky family s attorney and a key witness for the prosecution, fell from the fourth floor of an apartment building, apparently when a rope broke while he and others were trying to move a bathtub in through the window. He sustained head injuries. ",politics,"Jul 13, 2017",1
“RACIST” President Jackson To Be Replaced With Black Female Representing “Struggle For Racial Equality” On $20 Bill,"Obama has filled his cabinet with radical  yes  men and women who hold similar anti-American, leftist views. His radical Treasury Secretary, Jack Lew is no exception.  Treasury Secretary Jack Lew is expected to announce this week that Alexander Hamilton s face will remain on the front of the $10 bill and a woman will replace Andrew Jackson on the face of the $20 bill, a senior government source told CNN on Saturday.Lew announced last summer that he was considering redesigning the $10 bill to include the portrait of a woman. The decision to make the historic change at the expense of Hamilton drew angry rebukes from fans of the former Treasury Secretary. The pro-Hamilton movement gained steam after the smash success of the hip-hop Broadway musical about his life this year.Those pressures led Lew to determine that Hamilton should remain on the front of the bill. Instead, a mural-style depiction of the women s suffrage movement   including images of leaders such as Susan B. Anthony   will be featured on the back of the bill.Along those lines, Lew also plans to announce this week that Andrew Jackson   a less beloved former president whose face graces the front of the $20 bill   will be removed in favor of a female representing the struggle for racial equality, according to the government source.That decision would place a female on one of the most widely circulated bills in the world. But the historic change placing a female on the front of the $20 note won t come for more than a decade, the source said, since the process for changing the design of that note is still in the early stages.While some pointed to the many accomplishments and qualities of Hamilton for why he should stay on the currency printed by the very Treasury the man created, the more popular argument for the Founding Father s retention was an argument about how awful the man on the $20 dollar bill was.The Daily Beast described Jackson as  villainous  and linked to a February article that called him a  mass murderer. The New York Post argued that Old Hickory  may well have been our most racist president  and was a  vicious, power-mad kook. So a lot of folks really don t like the victor of the Battle of New Orleans. They hate him for owning slaves. They hate him for taking the side of the masses against financial experts. They hate him for ignoring laws and enforcing his own will when it came to policy decisions.And they hate Jackson most of all for his treatment of American Indians.These are pretty strong views, but Jackson s critics usually fail to comprehend important aspects of U.S. history in their denunciations of the rough-and-tumble general.For one, Jackson was not the only important American to own slaves. Far from it. For example, as most people should know, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were slaveholders. Both Washington and Jefferson are respectively featured on two different forms of currency and have large, imposing monuments dedicated to their memory in Washington D.C.There are no calls for their erasure from our coins or demolishing their monuments.Fewer people know that the Cherokee   victims of Jackson s Indian Removal Act   also owned slaves.There are no calls for renaming places and monuments designed to honor the Cherokee people.When it comes to Jackson s controversial handling of the Second Bank of the United States, it helps to realize the motives behind the president s actions. Jackson was opposed to the Central Bank not out of cookery but because he saw it as an undemocratic institution which did not care for the interests of the common man. Via: Daily Caller The soonest that a new $20 note will be issued is 2030,  the source said, citing a lengthy process convened by the Advanced Counterfeit Deterrence steering committee, which includes representatives from the U.S. Secret Service, the Treasury, and the Federal Reserve.

 George Takei Is Ready To Wage War Against The NRA,"Normally mild mannered George Takei is pissed at gun violence in this country, and he s planning to organize an LGBT army to do something about it.In an op-ed in The Daily Beast, the former Star Trek star and current Facebook sensation is beyond upset about the brutal massacre at the Pulse gay club in Orlando, Florida that left 49 dead and more than 50 injured. Takei, and many in the LGBT community, took the attack personally. Why wouldn t they? It was a terrorist attack, but it was also a very specifically targeted hate crime. It was an attack on all LGBT people. Takei argues that they were not the only community targeted, though. Nearly every casualty was also Latino. Those two communities is where Takei sees opportunity..Takei, a liberal, was very fair in his assessment, but he argues that the Second Amendment is in direct opposition to the First Amendment, especially in situations like mass shootings.For the average American, it is the First Amendment that articulates many of our most basic and fundamental civil rights: freedom of speech and of worship, but also of assembly and association. On Sunday, the latter two rights came under direct assault for the LGBT community. There is little doubt, for instance, that the killer targeted his victims out of hate. He intended to strike not just at people, but at a closely-knit community. After all, if his goal were sheer bloodshed and horror, Orlando boasts far more tempting and, some might even argue, more  sympathetic  targets. The killer apparently had issues with gay people; his father stated that, two weeks prior, his son  got very angry  at the mere sight of two men kissing in public, and even angrier that his own boy should witness it. At the same time, the killer was known to frequent the very establishment he attacked, suggesting that he may have deeply internalized the hate he heard from religious extremists.Takei didn t give ISIS a pass. He mentioned that they hate gay people and that the shooter claimed allegiance with the terrorist organization, but the fight to stop gay marriage and the fight to criminalize bathroom usage by transgender people pretty much shows that our attitudes aren t much better.Takei goes on to say that freedoms, even those guaranteed by the Constitution, have limits:But this is not so rare a circumstance. Indeed, there is no freedom within the Bill of Rights that is absolute. Even freedom of speech, a bedrock of our participatory democracy, has some established limits. I may not jokingly yell  fire  inside a crowded theater, precisely because the value of that speech is heavily outweighed by the danger to others who might panic. Nor may I cavalierly libel others without fear of legal repercussions. This is because we have decided, as a society, that the cost of the injuries that might arise outweighs any benefit from the freedom to say whatever I want.Takei is done with the gun debate. He has no desire to get rid of the Second Amendment, but he sees no reason everyday American should have assault rifles. He s ready to take on that fight, with a little help from his friends and he feels the LGBT community has spent the past several decades getting ready:Now this latest and most deadly attack has targeted a group that has spent the last few decades learning how to organize, fight for, and protect its rights. Perhaps, then, the next chapter of LGBT history might not be just about the struggle to gain equality for ourselves, but also how we might help lead this country towards a collective right to participate and live free of fear and terror, and ultimately toward a common-sense, permanent ban on weapons designed for mass slaughter.Like it or not, this history and this obligation have been thrust upon us, and we must now rise to its challenge. For if there is one group in this country with more will, more experience, and more tenacity than the NRA, it is the LGBT community.You don t want to mess with us.Featured image via Slaven Vlasic with Getty Images.

Wildfires kill at least 39 in Portugal and Spain,"LISBON/MADRID (Reuters) - At least 36 people died in wildfires raging through parched farmlands and forests in Portugal and another three in neighboring northwestern Spain on Sunday and Monday. Firefighters were battling 50 blazes in Portugal and a similar number in Spain. Portugal s government asked for international help and declared a state of emergency in territory north of the Tagus river - about half of its landmass. Flames ripped across Iberian countryside left tinder-dry by an unusually hot summer and early autumn, fanned by strong winds as remnants of ex-Hurricane Ophelia brushed coastal areas. Television footage showed abandoned villages with many houses in embers and charred vehicles left on the roads. Portuguese opposition parties and the media harshly criticized the government for failing to prevent a new wave of deadly fires after the country s worst ever forest fire in June that killed 64 people.  Prime Minister Antonio Costa, however, refused to sack his interior minister and defended his government s attempts to reform the troubled forestry management system.   It s a structural problem that we are facing... This is not a time for resignations, but for solutions. Everything has to be transformed into reforms, to provide responses that the country needs so that nothing stays the way it was after this year,  he told reporters after a television address to the nation.   We are aware that the country wants results from us and we re running against time after decades of negligence,  Costa told reporters after his address. At the heart of the problem is poor land management in Portugal, where traditional small plots have become fire hazards after being abandoned by successive generations of landholders who moved to the cities.  Interior Minister Constanca Urbano de Sousa said climate change was also to blame.  We are facing new (weather) conditions ... In an era of climate change, such disasters are becoming reality all over the world,  she said, citing the wildfires burning in California. The weekend fires also injured 63 people in Portugal, civil protection service spokeswoman Patricia Gaspar said. The toll could still increase as seven people were unaccounted for. Water-spraying planes could not be deployed against most fires due to gigantic plumes of smoke that reduced visibility. But Gaspar said rains expected late on Monday and on Tuesday in the north of Portugal were likely to bring some relief. The Lisbon government has been criticized for a slow, inefficient response and a lack of fire-prevention policies, leaving Portugal with Europe s largest expanse of woodland burned by wildfires. Portugal s fires have burned over 40 percent of the total in all of the European Union this year. With just 2.1 percent of the EU s landmass, Portugal suffered the biggest fires during 2008-16 as well, with an average of 36 percent of the total. Three people died in Spain s northwestern Galicia region - two of them women found inside a burnt-out car, the third a man in his 70s killed as he tried to save his farm animals, according to local media. Most of the fires in Galicia were started deliberately, said Alberto Nunez Feijoo, head of the regional government.  Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said some of those responsible had already been identified. They could face up to 20 years in jail if convicted. At least two persons were arrested in Portugal for allegedly starting fires. ",worldnews,"October 16, 2017 ",0
WATCH: NEW MOVIE Black Lives Matter Terrorists DON’T Want You To See…What REALLY Happened In FERGUSON Courtroom,"We ve written about the amazing filmmaker, playwright and journalist, Phelim MacAleer and his fearless wife Ann McElhinney several times over the past couple of years. They ve brilliantly exposed the Left  and their outrageous lies countless times. They are currently making a movie called  Gosnell  that will tell the truth the media hid about the crimes committed by serial killer,  Dr.  Kermit Gosnell. This husband and wife team are doing the work honest journalists, if they were being true to their profession, SHOULD be doing. Phelim s play  Ferguson,  that is now a movie, (see full-length version below) has completely dismantled the  hands up don t shoot  lie that was coordinated by the White House and professional race agitators.  This lie of course, was perpetrated by a willing media. MacAleer does a brilliant job of dispelling these lies by simply using the actual testimony from the case.From Phelim MacAleer:These are professional actors reading the actual words of eyewitnesses detailing minute by minute what happened in the run up to the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. FERGUSON the play consists of unaltered witness testimony, exactly as the Ferguson grand jury heard it. It includes forensic and medical examiner evidence that proves the truth and debunks the liars.You probably haven t missed the many and loud claims that the entertainment industry is racist and not diverse. It seems that  everyone who matters  agrees that diversity is a problem. Or at least that s what they say.But the reality is very different as I found when I wrote a play that offered ten roles for black men and women and even three significant roles for black women over 40   which everyone agrees can be a career death zone for women (of all races).And as a  diversity bonus  the play was going to be about an issue that of huge significance to the black community   it was called FERGUSON and was about the shooting of Michael Brown, a young black man by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.And this was to be no whitesplaining of the issue. I wrote, or rather curated, the play only using actual Grand Jury testimony of witnesses (most of them black). I didn t change their testimony at all. Not a paragraph, word or comma was added. It was to be a minute by minute account by multiple eyewitnesses of the last hours of Michael Brown s life. I decided to have a staged reading of the script over four nights at the Odyssey Theater in Santa Monica. It would be a great way for people to finally hear the truth about Ferguson   in the words of the people who witnessed the whole incident.The cast were enthusiastic at the auditions   there was a huge interest in the play   at last the truth about Ferguson and the shooting of Michael Brown would come out. Their enthusiasm lasted until the end of the first rehearsal. According to an LA Times reporter who was present many of the actors were aghast that the truth from eyewitnesses and forensic experts didn t match their idea of what really happened or what they read in the media. It was clear from the eyewitness testimony that Michael Brown didn t have his hands up surrendering as activists claimed. It was also clear, again from black eyewitnesses, that police officer Darren Wilson had no choice but to shoot Brown who was on a mini-crime rampage that morning.These facts did not please the actors who wanted to tell a different story. However this was Verbatim Theater   the story could only be told in the words of the witnesses. But the actors did not want to hear the genuine voices   even if they were black and under oath. Nine of the original 13 actors walked out. Most of them were black. Then a few of the white cast walked out in sympathy   one just 24 hours before the performance opened.Their walkout made a mockery of claims that there is a need for more diverse roles in the entertainment industry. This was a predominantly black cast in a play about a topic that was about an issue   police shootings of black men   that was of enormous interest to the black community.In reality what activists obviously meant was that they wanted black roles that pushed a left/liberal agenda. They may have wanted the actors faces to be a diverse color but they so did not want diversity of thought or ideas to be presented on the stage. No   those ideas had to be shut down. And it s not as if those ideas don t get a lot of interest. The staged reading of Ferguson   over a four night run   in a 99-seat theater was one of the most talked about plays of the year in Los Angeles. As a writer for liberal LA Weekly put it FERGUSON achieved something  almost unheard of in L.A. s stage community   it moved theater from the arts section to the front page. Despite the walkout I was determined the Show Would Go On. Eventually we hired replacement cast for all the actors and the play was staged for its planned four night run. It was an enormous success.LA Weekly said Ferguson was  divisive, but riveting  and  an incendiary night of theatre . It was covered by a huge range of media outlets including NPR, The Hollywood Reporter and Rush Limbaugh.Now that is true diversity!To ensure the truth about Ferguson reaches as big an audience as possible I have now filmed the staged reading.Please enjoy it. The truth is compelling.  Phelim MacAleer",politics,"May 12, 2016",1
Senate tax bill stalls on deficit-focused 'trigger',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday delayed voting on a Republican tax overhaul as the bill was tripped up by problems with an amendment sought by fiscal hawks to address a large expansion of the federal budget deficit projected to result from the measure. The Senate debated the legislation late into Thursday and adjourned, putting off any votes until Friday morning. It was unclear if a decisive vote on the bill would occur then. The delay underscored nagging concerns among Republican fiscal conservatives about the deficit impact of the bill. That set up the possibility that its deep tax cuts might have to be moderated, that future tax increases might be built in, and that some conservatives might seek to attach spending cuts, all approaches that could throw up new political problems. White House legislative affairs director Marc Short told reporters in the Capitol: “I don’t think tax cuts are going to be scaled back. I think it would still be historic tax relief for corporations and for middle-income families.”  The tax bill is seen by Republicans as crucial to their prospects in the November 2018 elections, when they will fight to keep control of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump and  Republicans now in control of Congress have yet to pass major legislation, a fact they hope to change with their proposed tax- code overhaul, which would be the biggest since the 1980s. Democrats, expected to unanimously oppose the tax bill, have dismissed it as a giveaway to the wealthy and corporations. Republican Senator Bob Corker and others had tried to add a provision to the bill to trigger automatic future tax increases if the tax cuts in the bill did not boost the economy and generate revenues sufficient to offset the deficit expansion. But the Senate parliamentarian barred Corker’s “trigger” proposal on procedural grounds. The trigger amendment was needed to win Corker’s vote and those of others worried about the deficit - worries that intensified when congressional analysts said the bill would not boost the economy enough to offset the estimated deficit expansion, as the Trump administration had said it would. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch told reporters in the Capitol that it had not been easy to accommodate Corker, Senator Jeff Flake and other fiscal hawks. “It’s been pretty hard to make them happy so far. We’re going to keep working on it ... and we’re going to do it,” Hatch said. Senate Republicans were considering making a proposed corporate income tax rate cut temporary, instead of permanent, so the rate would rise back to an unknown level after six or seven years, said one Republican senator and an aide. By that time, Trump might no longer be in office and a future Congress might change the law. When asked if the tax bill was in trouble, Republican Senator Mike Rounds told reporters: “No, I don’t think so. It’s just a matter of once again trying to make the bill work.” Optimism had reigned earlier in the day, when the bill won the backing of Republican Senator John McCain. Stocks surged on hopes that a key tax overhaul vote was imminent. The S&P 500 hit a record closing high and the Dow Jones industrial average topped the 24,000 mark for the first time. But the Joint Committee on Taxation, or JCT, a nonpartisan fiscal analysis unit of Congress, said the bill as passed earlier by the Senate Finance Committee, would generate only $407 billion in new tax revenue from increased economic growth. JCT had earlier estimated the tax bill would balloon the $20 trillion national debt by $1.4 trillion over 10 years. The new estimate, counting “dynamic” economic effects, put the deficit expansion at $1 trillion, far short of assertions by some Republicans that the tax cuts would pay for themselves. House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said the new JCT estimate showed “no amount of dynamic scoring fairy dust will fix the catastrophic deficits of the GOP tax scam.” McCain, a key player in July’s collapse of a Republican effort to gut Obamacare, backed the tax bill. While “far from perfect,” the party’s 2008 presidential nominee said it would boost the economy and help all Americans. Republican Senator Susan Collins, who also played a role in the failure of the Obamacare rollback, told reporters she was still not committed to the bill. Several Republicans were withholding support while pushing for including a federal deduction for up to $10,000 in state and local property taxes and bigger tax breaks for “pass-through” companies, including small businesses. As drafted, the Senate bill would cut the U.S. corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent after a one-year delay and reduce the tax burden on businesses and individuals, while ending many tax breaks, but would still expand the deficit, Trump wants to enact tax cuts before January. The House approved its own tax bill on Nov. 16. It would have to be merged with the Senate bill, if it is approved, before any final measure could go to Trump for his signature.  Republicans have 52 votes in the 100-member Senate, giving them enough to win if they hold together. With Democrats opposed, Republicans could lose no more than two of their own votes, with Vice President Mike Pence able to break a 50-50 tie. Trump has attacked Corker and Flake on Twitter. Both senators are not seeking re-election. In early October, the president called Corker, “Liddle’ Bob Corker” in a tweet. Corker tweeted that the Trump White House was an “adult daycare center.” Days later, he called Trump a liar who had damaged U.S. standing in the world. Trump tweeted back saying Corker “couldn’t get elected dog catcher.” Trump earlier this month tweeted that Flake’s political career was ‘toast’” In a dramatic Senate speech, Flake said U.S. politics had become inured to “reckless, outrageous and undignified” behavior from the White House.

 Obama Just SCHOOLED Trump On How To Act Presidential In Louisiana (VIDEO),"Ever since Trump first seized on the flooding in Louisiana as an opportunity to pretend he s presidential, it has been abundantly clear that he has no idea what the f*ck he s doing. Though Gov. John Bel Edwards specifically asked Trump to volunteer or donate rather than show up for a photo op, The Donald has the biggest hands, the best brain, and the hugest ideas, so he popped by anyway to spend about a minute handing out Play Doh and other items to flood victims who were much in need of water, food, clothing, and other items typically needed by people who just lost everything in a natural disaster.Trump has spent a good deal of time whining that President Obama did not immediately rush off to Louisiana, but Obama was simply respecting the wishes of the Governor, who said he d  rather he give us another week or two. And then he can visit. President Obama complied, while Trump showed up anyway. After all, he was busy crafting a narrative that Barack Obama hates flood victims. Isn t that more important?Trump, facing criticism for failing to donate money to help, ultimately gave $100 million to a church run by a hate group leader.On Tuesday, after respecting the Governor s wishes and the needs of the people, President Obama toured the flood-damaged areas. To him, this wasn t a photo op. To him, this was a tragedy whose victims needed as much support as they could get. We are heartbroken by the loss of life,  Obama told reporters after surveying the devastation that left 13 dead, more than 60,000 homes damaged, and more than 106,000 residents in a position that they applied for aid through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. I think anybody who can see just the streets, much less the inside of the homes here, people s lives have been upended by this flood. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told CNN that $120 million in aid has already been approved. But President Obama made it clear that the effort to fix the damage is only just beginning: Sometimes once the flood waters pass, people s attention spans pass. This is not a one off. This is not a photo-op issue. This is how do you make sure that a month from now, three months from now, six months from now, people still are getting the help that they need. I need all Americans to stay focused on this. If you re watching this today, make sure that you find out how you can help. You can go to volunteers.louisiana.gov, or you can go to fema.gov, or you can go to whitehouse.gov. We ll tell you. We ll direct you how you can help. President Obama is correct. A natural disaster, especially of this scale, is not an excuse to rush there for a photo op. It s a reason for the community and the country to come together to fix things. It s a time for the President to step up and focus on the long-term response rather than looking good for the media   and it s especially not the time to pander to Donald Trump s wishes.Let s hope Trump learns something about acting  presidential  from this.

HOW THE FBI Cracked A Terror Plot On Black Friday That May Have Been Worse Than 9-11," The U.S. is the great enemy of mankind!  raved Ernesto  Che  Guevara in 1961.  Against those hyenas there is no option but extermination. We will bring the war to the imperialist enemies  very home, to his places of work and recreation. The imperialist enemy must feel like a hunted animal wherever he moves. Thus we ll destroy him! We must keep our hatred against them (the U.S.) alive and fan it to paroxysms!  -Che Guevara, head of Cuba s  Foreign Liberation Department,  Nov. 17, 1962We have a president who won t tie Islamic terrorists to Islam, has cut a one-sided deal with Iran, as they continue to chant  death to America,  and has made an open alliance with a communist country who has a long history of hating America. The same country Obama is fighting to normalize relations with, would have committed an unspeakable act of terrorism against us, had our FBI not thwarted their plans.  Why the rush to embrace so many nations and leaders who have a long history of wanting to harm us Barry?  On the morning of November 17th, 1962, FBI headquarters in Washington D.C. took on  all the trappings of a military command post,  according to historian William Breuer. The previous night an intelligence puzzle had finally come together. The resulting picture staggered the FBI men. And these had served at their posts during WWII and the height of the Cold War. They d seen plenty. Now they had mere days to foil a crime against their nation to rival Hideki Tojo s.The agents and officers were haggard and red-eyed  but seriously wired. Like hawks on a perch they d been watching the plot unfold, sweating bullets the whole time. It was nearing time to swoop down on Fidel Castro and Che Guevara s agents, busy with a terror plot that would have made ISIS drool decades later.Alan Belmont was second to J Edgar Hoover at the time. Raymond Wannall headed the Bureau s Intelligence Division. That nerve-jangling morning both were in Belmont s office just down the hall from Hoover s. Both were burning up the telephone lines to their agents in New York. On one phone they had Special Agent John Malone who ran the New York field office. On other lines they talked with several carloads of FBI agents slinking around Manhattan. These were keeping a touch-and-go, but more or less constant, surveillance on the ringleaders of the Cuban terror plot.Castro s agents had targeted Macy s, Gimbels, Bloomingdales, and Manhattan s Grand Central Station with a dozen incendiary devices and 500 kilos of TNT. The holocaust was set for detonation the following week, on the day after Thanksgiving.A little perspective: For their March 2004 Madrid subway blasts, all 10 of them, that killed and maimed almost 2,000 people, al-Qaeda used a grand total of 100 kilos of TNT. Castro and Che s agents planned to set off five times that explosive power in the three biggest department stores on earth, all packed to suffocation and pulsing with holiday cheer on the year s biggest shopping day. Macy s get s 50,000 shoppers that one day. Thousands of New Yorkers, including women and children actually, given the date and targets, probably mostly women and children were to be incinerated and entombed. ( We greeted each other as old friends,  gushed Jimmy Carter when visiting Fidel Castro in 2002.)At the time, the FBI relied heavily on  HUMINT  (Human Intelligence.) So they d expertly penetrated the plot. One by one the ringleaders were ambushed. The first was named Roberto Santiesteban and he was nabbed while walking down Riverside Drive. As the agents closed in, Santiesteban saw them and  took off! And as he ran, Santiesteban was jamming paper in his mouth and chewing furiously.But six FBI agents were after him, all fleet of foot themselves. Finally they closed the ring and  triangulated  the suspect. Santiesteban fell, raging and cursing, flailing his arms and jabbing his elbows like a maniac. They grabbed his arm and bent it behind his back just as he was reaching for his pistol.While this group got their man, another FBI squad arrested a couple named Elsa Montero and Jose Gomez-Abad as they left their apartment on West 71st Street. The FBI speculated that as many as 30 others might have been in on the plot, but these were the head honchos. Had those detonators gone off, 9/11 might be remembered as the SECOND deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil.Some of these plotters belonged to the New York Chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, an outfit that became MUCH better known a year later on that very week. Incidentally, at the time of the Manhattan terror plot, the Fair Play For Cuba Committee also included among its members, CBS correspondent Robert Taber (an early version of Dan Rather, who conducted Castro s first network television soft-soaping on Aug. 30, 1957), along with The Nation magazine co-owner Alan Sagner. In 1996 President Clinton appointed Alan Sagner head of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.Terror-plotters Roberto Santiesteban, Elsa Montero and Jose Gomez-Abad belonged to the Castro-Cuban Mission to the U.N. and escaped prosecution by indignantly claiming  diplomatic immunity.  Via: TownhallIt s hard to imagine any American would ever consider Che Guevara to be a hero And then again, maybe it s not so hard to imagine:Maria Isabel is the campaign volunteer who hung this Che Guevara poster in the Obama campaign office in Houston, TX.

Trump weighs recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital: officials,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is considering recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, a move that could upend decades of American policy and ratchet up Middle East tensions, but is expected to again delay his campaign promise to move the U.S. embassy there, U.S. officials said on Thursday. After months of intense White House deliberations, Trump is likely to make an announcement next week that seeks to strike a balance between domestic political demands and geopolitical pressures over an issue at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict – the status of Jerusalem, home to sites holy to the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions. Trump is weighing a plan under which he would declare Jerusalem the capital of Israel, the officials said, deviating from White House predecessors who have insisted that it is a matter that must be decided in peace negotiations. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, and the international community does not recognize Israel’s claim on the entire city. Such a move by Trump, which could be carried out through a presidential statement or speech, would anger the Palestinians as well as the broader Arab World and likely undermine the Trump administration’s fledgling effort to restart long-stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. It could, however, help satisfy the pro-Israel, right-wing base that helped him win the presidency and also please the Israeli government, a close U.S. ally. Trump is likely to continue his predecessors’ policy of signing a six-month waiver overriding a 1995 law requiring that the U.S. Embassy be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the officials said. But among the options under consideration is for Trump to order his aides to develop a longer-term plan for the embassy’s relocation to make clear his intent to do so eventually, according to one of the officials. However, the U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, cautioned that the plan has yet to be finalized and Trump could still alter parts of it. “No decision has been made on that matter yet,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Thursday. Trump pledged on the presidential campaign trail last year that he would move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. But Trump in June waived the requirement, saying he wanted to “maximize the chances” for a peace push led by his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner.  Those efforts have made little if any progress. The status of Jerusalem is one of the major stumbling blocks in achieving peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem during the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it, a move not recognized internationally.  Palestinian leaders, Arab governments and Western allies have long urged Trump not to proceed with the embassy relocation, which would go against decades of U.S. policy by granting de facto U.S. recognition of Israel’s claim to all of Jerusalem as its capital. However, if Trump decides to declare Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, even without ordering an embassy move, it would be certain to spark an international uproar.  A key question would be whether such a declaration would be enshrined as a formal presidential action or simply be a symbolic statement by Trump. Some of Trump’s top aides have privately pushed for him to keep his campaign promise to satisfy a range of supporters, including evangelical Christians, while others have warned of the potential damage to U.S. relations with Muslim countries.

London art auction raises $2.5 million for survivors of deadly Grenfell Tower blaze,"LONDON (Reuters) - An auction of 31 artworks donated by some of Britain s most successful contemporary artists has raised close to 2 million pounds for survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire that killed about 80 people in June. Home to a close-knit, multi-ethnic community, the 24-storey social housing block was reduced to a charred ruin by the inferno that engulfed it in the middle of the night. Many survivors have yet to be rehoused and are still living in hotels. The charity auction, held at autioneer Sotheby s late on Monday, included works by A-list artists including Wolfgang Tillmans, Antony Gormley, Tracey Emin, Sarah Lucas, Mark Wallinger and Rachel Whiteread. The idea came from film producer and art collector Hamish McAlpine and art consultant Katie Heller, who said the emotional impact of the Grenfell tragedy was such that almost all the artists they approached agreed to donate works immediately.  Grenfell touched their souls,  McAlpine told Reuters at Sotheby s before the auction.  It s a very emotive subject for people in London.  The proceeds, which totaled more than 1.925 million pounds  ($2.55 million), will be divided equally among 158 surviving families. They will receive the funds before Christmas. Every single one of the lots on offer sold, making the auction a  White Glove  sale in auctioneers  parlance, Sotheby s said. The amount raised was double the pre-auction estimate. The most expensive lot was  Freischwimmer 193 , a very large green print by the London-based German artist Wolfgang Tillmans, which sold for 392,750 pounds. Next came  Small Charge , a cast iron sculpture by Antony Gormley, which was snapped up for 344,750 pounds. Two of the artworks were especially created for the auction. Tacita Dean s  Lay the Dust With Tears , a gray and black charcoal-on-paper image reminiscent of billowing smoke, sold for 22,500 pounds, while Idris Khan s  I Remember , also a somber image in dark tones made with oil, charcoal and chalk on paper, went for 43,750 pounds.

"AFGHANISTAN: Forgotten, But Not Gone"," US Army paratrooper in Afghanistan s Konar province (Photo: Spc. Lorenzo Ware/US Army. Source: Wikicommons)Miles Elliott 21st Century WireThe war in Afghanistan is the longest war in US history. Now in its 16th year (and third US President), one might expect the war to be winding down; however, with a resurgent Taliban, and ISIS allegedly present in the country as well, President Trump has recently delegated authority over prosecution of the war to the Pentagon. Now, additional US and NATO troops are being deployed to Afghanistan, and Secretary of Defense James Mattis (together with National Security Advisor HR McMaster) is developing a new, more aggressive strategy for the war. In short, there is no end in sight.Although other wars have claimed this title in the past, Afghanistan is referred to by many as  the forgotten war.  Even though it has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of US troops and many more people from Afghanistan, it sits nowhere near the forefront of public consciousness; it is more a vague blob in the public s peripheral vision. Nine years ago, in July 2008, PBS aired a video report from their correspondent embedded with US troops in Afghanistan. Even then, at a time before George W Bush had vacated the Oval Office, the title of the video was Afghanistan: The Forgotten War . Then, eight years later at the height of 2016 presidential race, the LA Times published an editorial called  Afghanistan: The campaign s forgotten war , in which the author points out that neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump even bothered to mention Afghanistan in their convention speeches.Trump was critical of US military interventionism during his campaign however, and even before his bid for the presidency began, he was in the habit of taking to Twitter to lambast the Obama administration for perpetuating the war in Afghanistan.Let s get out of Afghanistan. Our troops are being killed by the Afghanis we train and we waste billions there. Nonsense!  Rebuild the USA.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2013But that did not stop Obama   who promised to end the war by 2014 from leaving the White House in January 2017 with 8,400 US troops still stationed in Afghanistan. It is also not stopping Trump himself from reversing course and presiding over the next escalation of US involvement in the country.With the Taliban now in control of more territory than it has been since the US first went into Afghanistan in 2001, and the supposed appearance of ISIS in the country, one has to wonder what the last 16 years have really been about.Surge 4.0For the past few weeks, the American mainstream press has been reporting on Pentagon plans to send additional troops to Afghanistan. Although the number 4,000 has been widely circulated, no official announcements regarding the number or strategy have yet been made. The new strategy is set to be publicly announced in mid-July, and it looks as though more US troops will be sent to Afghanistan to add to the 8,500 American troops already in country. Similarly, fifteen of the twenty-nine NATO member nations so far have also agreed to send more troops to Afghanistan to add to the current NATO presence of 5,000 troops. (It should be noted that there is not currently a US or NATO combat mission in Afghanistan; instead, foreign troops are there on a mission to train Afghan forces.)There is serious doubt among informed observers as to whether an additional few thousand troops will make any difference. After the number 4,000 had been suggested, General Jack Keane, former vice chief-of-staff of the US Army, suggested that between 10,000 and 20,000 additional troops were needed to make a difference. Similarly, in the past few days, former CIA director and defense secretary Leon Panetta also weighed in, echoing Keane s opinion that 4,000 troops would not change the momentum.As Danny Sjursen (the author of the article below) points out, the upcoming surge  in troop levels would be the fourth such move made by the US, following three similar increases by Bush and Obama in the years 2008-2010. It is beginning to look like escalating (or, in the case of Bush, starting) war in Afghanistan is something of a rite of passage for new presidents, as all three commanders-in-chief who have presided over the war have done so within the first year of their first terms. The question is, what is the US government actually trying to achieve, and is  winning  even possible?Remember how the mainstream media treated the surge orchestrated by General David Petraeus in Iraq in 2007. The idea of the surge was received with fawning adoration throughout the media, and even by President Bush, who played his part in helping to advertise and hype up the strategy. And afterwards Petraeus had no problem taking all the credit for his  success .Except it wasn t a success. Its goals of ending sectarian violence and reconciling Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds were noble, but were not achieved with any meaningful staying power; the destabilization originally introduced by US intervention ultimately prevailed, and ISIS was the result. The point is that in Iraq, the surge was a triumph of marketing, a rebrand, a new sexy cover for a grisly reality. According to the Boston Globe: For Americans, the myth of the victorious surge is so seductive because it perpetuates an illusion of control. It frames the Iraq War as something other than a geostrategic blunder and remembers our effort as something more than a stalemate. What s more, it reinforces the notion that it s possible to influence events around the world, if only military force is deployed properly. It s a myth that makes victory in the current Iraq mission appear achievable. Now replace the word  Iraq  with  Afghanistan .One sad and daunting possibility is that Afghanistan has become a sort of operations  incubator  used by the West, that one of the purposes served by a perpetual US and NATO presence there is to provide real-life training and experience to their troops, and to test weapons and equipment. Over time, a very significant number of foreign troops can be cycled in from various countries, and those countries then benefit from being able to test out new weapons, bombs, combat methods, training, and operational procedures and tactics. This prospect is even mentioned in Danny Sjursen s article: As one high-ranking Afghan official recently lamented, thinking undoubtedly of the first use in his land of the largest non-nuclear bomb on the planet,  Is the plan just to use our country as a testing ground for bombs?' If that is even partly the case, the West requires a theater of war containing a long, infinitely extendable conflict in order to fulfil these requirements for the wider military-industrial complex. In Afghanistan, that s exactly what they have.A Flawed StrategyIn a recent article by independent journalist Gareth Porter, he points out that the US strategy in Afghanistan has a fatal flaw, which goes a long way toward explaining why the war is not being  won : The real reason for the fundamental weakness of the US-NATO war is the fact that the United States has empowered a rogues  gallery of Afghan warlords whose militias have imposed a regime of chaos, violence and oppression on the Afghan population   stealing, killing and raping with utter impunity. In Porter s view, American objectives and methods in ousting the Taliban may have been short-sighted, as the Taliban came to power partly as a response to the sexual violence and predatory behaviour of Afghan warlords . The organization [Taliban] appeared in 1994 in response to the desperate pleas of the population in the south  especially in a Kandahar province divided up by four warlords  to stop the wholesale abduction and rape of women and pre-teen boys, as well as the uncontrolled extortion of tolls by warlord troops. The Taliban portrayed themselves as standing for order and elementary justice against chaos and sexual violence, and they immediately won broad popular support to drive the warlords out of power across the south, finally taking over Kabul without a fight. Ever since the invasion in 2001, the US has played favorites with the warlords, pitting various leaders against one another; helping selected ones to become more powerful, allowing some to become regional governors, putting others on the CIA payroll, and eventually turning their private militias into the national police. Over the years several different US commanders have taken the reins of the war in Afghanistan, but this strategy of using the warlord militias persisted, since there was no other adequate source of manpower to provide security, not only for the general population in Afghanistan but also for the US-NATO coalition troops themselves.The occurrence of  green-on-blue  attacks by Afghan police or military against US/coalition forces (such as the one last month that killed three American soldiers) may be largely attributable to the strategy of using warlord militias, but it is worth mentioning that the Taliban also actively infiltrates both the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police. Moreover, in Helmand and Kandahar provinces in particular, profits from the drug trade provide temptation to every element in society. As one article stated, the two provinces burdened with the bulk of green-on-blue attacks are Helmand and Kandahar. It is no coincidence that these areas are where the Taliban are strongest, and where the country s highest levels of opium poppy cultivation help fund the insurgency. Although the frequency of green-on-blue attacks has declined (corresponding with the reduced US presence in Afghanistan), the number of different groups and interests represented on the ground make for an exceedingly complex web of relationships in which it is not always easy to see an attack coming.Coupled with the flawed and failing US strategy of alliances is an unwillingness to admit defeat amongst both civilian and military managers of the Afghan war. The combination of these two factors could be a significant contributing factor as to why the conflict shows no signs of ending. In an interview with Gareth Porter, radio host and antiwar activist Scott Horton made the point this way: It is the case that every one of these guys in the war cabinet are heavily invested in some sort of spin that they won or are winning, or that there is some kind of positive light at the end of the tunnel, because each and every one of them is wrapped up in it. [Secretary of Defense] Mattis was in the original war, and was the head of CENTCOM for a time in charge of the war. [National Security Advisor] McMaster was in charge of counter-corruption during the Petraeus-Obama surge in 2009-2012. You have the Secretary of Homeland Security who apparently has quite a bit of sway, Kelly, whose son died in Helmand province in Petraeus  surge, and they re not going to want to admit that that was a sunk cost lost, for understandable reasons. Dunford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well, has been in charge of the Afghan war. So these men have everything to lose by admitting that they lost. Porter agrees that there are other contributing factors to the war being seemingly unending and unwinnable, such as: the careers of the US officers who serve there; the bureaucratic stakes of the Joint Special Operations Command and the CIA in their huge programs and facilities in the country; the political cost of admitting that it was a futile effort from the start. Plus, the Pentagon and the CIA are determined to hold on to Afghan airstrips they use to carry out drone war in Pakistan for as long as possible. A word that frequently gets used with regard to the Afghan conflict is  stalemate . After nearly 16 years, the Taliban now exercises control over about 40% of the territory in Afghanistan. They have allies such as the Haqqani network resupplying them from bordering Pakistan  considered something of a safe haven for terrorists despite being a US ally. As Danny Sjursen writes:  if all goes well (which isn t exactly a surefire thing), that s likely to be the best that Surge 4.0 can produce: a long, painful tie. These criticisms may sound harsh to those hoping that the coming surge will make a difference, but the problems (and questions) regarding America s involvement in Afghanistan are far deeper and broader than those presented above.Fraud, Waste & AbuseOn a financial level, corruption and waste rule the day on both the Afghan and American sides of US involvement  and there is an astounding amount of money at stake. While the overall war has cost US taxpayers around a trillion dollars so far, funds appropriated for reconstruction stand at over $117 billion. As usual, it looks like money in the form of government contracts may be a reason why there is little urgency to end the war. As Ryan Crocker, former US Ambassador to Afghanistan, said: The ultimate failure for our efforts wasn t an insurgency. It was more the weight of endemic corruption. John Sopko, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), makes quarterly reports to Congress about his oversight of spending on reconstruction in Afghanistan. Some of SIGAR s findings over the years have been breathtaking. Take for example SIGAR s finding that there may be 200,000  ghost soldiers , Afghan soldiers whose salaries are US-taxpayer funded but who seem not even to exist except on paper. Or the gas station that cost an absurd $43 million to build, but that nobody uses and about which the Pentagon now has no knowledge. Or the $28 million needlessly spent on uniforms for the Afghan army, in  forest camouflage, even though woodland covers only 2.1% of Afghan territory.As of two years ago, there was $35 billion in reconstruction funds spent that could not be accounted for, with many projects failing to meet requirements or specifications. It would seem the contractors winning the bids to rebuild Afghanistan are doing rather well for themselves; underwritten by the US taxpayer, there appears to be no end to the amount of money in the trough. As Sopko told WhoWhatWhy: We have spent more in Afghanistan than we did on the entire Marshall Plan to rebuild postwar Europe. The American taxpayer has had to foot that $114 billion bill, so they deserve to know not only the cost but also what it has gotten them. Bear in mind that SIGAR only covers reconstruction costs, not appropriations for bombs, arms, planes or other military equipment, vehicles or weaponry.

Source: Wikicommons)The Opium QuestionSince the US military first invaded Afghanistan in 2001, production of opium in the country has increased dramatically. Although it is impossible to measure exactly how much opium is being produced, the UN produces yearly reports in which it estimates production levels, as well as how much land area is allocated for purpose of growing opium poppies. The latest UN figures for the year 2015-2016 show a significant increase in both the area used for opium cultivation (from 183,00 to 201,000 hectares, a 10% increase), as well as for potential production of opium (from 3,300 tons to 4,800 tons, a 43% increase).In addition, despite $8.5 billion spent on eradication, the area destroyed by eradication efforts decreased by 91% from 2015 to 2016 (from 3,760 hectares eradicated down to just 355 hectares eradicated), and yield increased by 30% (from 18.3 kg of opium produced per hectare to 23.8 kg). All this places 2016 into the top three years for opium cultivation since the UN Office on Drugs and Crime began monitoring opium in Afghanistan in 1994.Afghanistan is the world s largest opium producer by a very wide margin, with a widely cited statistic being that opium from Afghanistan is in 90% of the heroin produced worldwide. Opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan to 2016 (Image: UNODC. Source: Afghanistan Opium Survey 2016)War on Drugs?America s War on Drugs is rife with contradictions, but the fact that US troops (and DEA agents) have been stationed in a country responsible for 90% of the world s heroin market for 16 years, with production increasing and eradication declining, is, shall we say, counter-intuitive   especially when one considers that at home, media outlets across the country are reporting daily on America s heroin and opioid  epidemic .According to the CDC, deaths due to opioid overdose in the United States increased by 16% between 2014 and 2015. Between 2002 and 2013, deaths due to heroin overdose nearly quadrupled. (Opioids are a class of drug that includes opiates  natural, opium-derived drugs like morphine  as well as synthetic versions like oxycodone or fentanyl; both are lethal and rapidly-growing problems in the United States.) Of course this is to say nothing about the legions of people languishing in US prisons for the nonviolent crime of drug possession.To assume that there is no connection between the country that helps supply 90% of the world s heroin on the one hand, and an explosion in America of heroin-related addiction and death on the other, is foolhardy to say the least.It is also noteworthy that in July 2000, in cooperation with the UN, the Taliban outlawed the growing of opium, which is why production dropped sharply for the year 2001. As summarized in a 2004 academic paper for the International Journal of Drug Policy: Afghanistan was the main source of the world s illicit heroin supply for most of the 1990s. From late 2000 and the year that followed, the Taliban enforced a ban on poppy farming via threats, forced eradication, and public punishment of transgressors. The result was a 99% reduction in the area of opium poppy farming in Taliban-controlled areas  It is concluded that the reduction in Afghan poppy cultivation was due to the enforcement action by the Taliban. Globally, the net result of the intervention produced an estimated 35% reduction in poppy cultivation and a 65% reduction in the potential illicit heroin supply from harvests in 2001. Though Afghan poppy growing returned to previous levels after the fall of the Taliban government, this may have been the most effective drug control action of modern times. If one only ever observed US involvement in Afghanistan, it might begin to look as though perhaps the United States is not actually waging a war on drugs. US troops are there, in the poppy fields, production is rising, and live on Fox News, a USMC lieutenant colonel clearly told Geraldo Rivera  we provide them [poppy farmers] security, we re providing them resources .  However, Afghanistan is not the only instance we have of the US government protecting drug traffickers. Abby Martin explains:In 2012, a Mexican government official from Juarez told Al Jazeera that the CIA and other international security forces  don t fight drug traffickers  and that instead, the agency tries to  manage the drug trade.  Back in the fifties, the CIA turned a blind eye to drug trafficking through the Golden Triangle while training Taiwanese troops against Communist China. As William Blum reports in Rogue State: The CIA flew the drugs all over Southeast Asia, to sites where the opium was processed into heroin, and to trans-shipment points on the route to Western customers. These are far from isolated incidents. During the eighties, the CIA financially and logistically backed anti-communist contras in Nicaragua who also happened to be international drug traffickers. Former Representative Ron Paul elaborated on the CIA s notorious corruption when speaking to a group of students about Iran-Contra: [Drug trafficking] is a gold mine for people who want to raise money in the underground government in order to finance projects that they can t get legitimately. It is very clear that the CIA has been very much involved with drug dealings. We saw [Iran-Contra] on television. They were hauling down weapons and drugs back. There are certainly questions that the US government has to answer about its relationship with the drug business. But another aspect of Afghan opium production which deserves further investigation is the extent of Chinese involvement in the modern opium trade coming out of Afghanistan. It has been reported that Afghan poppy farmers have begun growing what they call  Chinese seed , a genetically-modified poppy seed that allow farmers to grow poppies year-round and harvest their crops every two months. In March of this year, CNBC reported that  Chinese seed  was in fact being grown legally in China for pharmaceutical purposes but had somehow crossed the border into Afghanistan.Last month 21WIRE featured the documentary Afghan Overdose, about the Afghan opium trade, in our Sunday Screening series.Afghanistan and EmpireTo understand how globalist empire-builders view Afghanistan, however, we might direct readers  attention to a superb video by James Corbett for Global Research s GRTV. In the video, Corbett explains in a very concise fashion the greater historical and geopolitical context out of which the current conflict in Afghanistan arose.. The video provides evidence as to why 9/11 could not have been the real reason for the US invasion of Afghanistan, and what makes the country an extremely important asset in geopolitical and geostrategic terms. Afghanistan s position as the world s preeminent producer of opium alone would make the country very significant on the world stage; according to UN figures from 2010, the market for opiates worldwide is worth $65 billion, although the actual figure today could be considerably higher. Another very important factor making Afghanistan an attractive economic prize is what lies under the ground in the country; in addition to a significant amount of oil and gas, Afghanistan is also home to a vast wealth of minerals such as iron, copper, cobalt, gold and lithium, estimated at over $1 trillion in value. Let s also not forget its appeal as the potential location for energy pipelines.As Corbett explains, however, the real value of Afghanistan is its strategic location. Drawing on the geostrategic treatises of Halford Mackinder and Zbigniew Brzezinski, Corbett places Afghanistan at the very center of the new Great Game, the battle between east and west for the crucial region of Central Asia, and ultimately the globe.Should we really be surprised by any of this? Although the Hollywood/mainstream media/pop-culture view of America is that of a democratic, freedom-loving, law-abiding member of the international community, regular readers of 21WIRE will already be aware that this image is largely a myth. In a recent article for The American Conservative deconstructing the myth of a  rules-based international order , Boston University historian Andrew Bacevich points out that: Among the items failing to qualify for mention in the liberal internationalist, rules-based version of past U.S. policy are the following: meddling in foreign elections; coups and assassination plots in Iran, Guatemala, the Congo, Cuba, South Vietnam, Chile, Nicaragua, and elsewhere; indiscriminate aerial bombing campaigns in North Korea and throughout Southeast Asia; a nuclear arms race bringing the world to the brink of Armageddon; support for corrupt, authoritarian regimes in Iran, Turkey, Greece, South Korea, South Vietnam, the Philippines, Brazil, Egypt, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and elsewhere many of them abandoned when deemed inconvenient; the shielding of illegal activities through the use of the Security Council veto; unlawful wars launched under false pretenses;  extraordinary rendition,  torture, and the indefinite imprisonment of persons without any semblance of due process. The United States has not lived up to what the media tells us it is for some time. The war in Afghanistan is no exception.More on this story from TomDispatch  US Special Operations Task Force at Bagram air field, Afghanistan (Photo: Tech. Sgt. Michael A. O Connor/USAF. Source: Wikicommons) Danny Sjursen TomDispatchWe walked in a single file. Not because it was tactically sound. It wasn t   at least according to standard infantry doctrine. Patrolling southern Afghanistan in column formation limited maneuverability, made it difficult to mass fire, and exposed us to enfilading machine-gun bursts. Still, in 2011, in the Pashmul District of Kandahar Province, single file was our best bet.The reason was simple enough: improvised bombs not just along roads but seemingly everywhere.  Hundreds of them, maybe thousands. Who knew?That s right, the local  Taliban    a term so nebulous it s basically lost all meaning  had managed to drastically alter U.S. Army tactics with crude, homemade explosives stored in plastic jugs. And believe me, this was a huge problem. Cheap, ubiquitous, and easy to bury, those anti-personnel Improvised Explosive Devices, or IEDs, soon littered the  roads,  footpaths, and farmland surrounding our isolated outpost. To a greater extent than a number of commanders willingly admitted, the enemy had managed to nullify our many technological advantages for a few pennies on the dollar (or maybe, since we re talking about the Pentagon, it was pennies on the millions of dollars).Truth be told, it was never really about our high-tech gear.  Instead, American units came to rely on superior training and discipline, as well as initiative and maneuverability, to best their opponents.  And yet those deadly IEDs often seemed to even the score, being both difficult to detect and brutally effective. So there we were, after too many bloody lessons, meandering along in carnival-like, Pied Piper-style columns. Bomb-sniffing dogs often led the way, followed by a couple of soldiers carrying mine detectors, followed by a few explosives experts. Only then came the first foot soldiers, rifles at the ready. Anything else was, if not suicide, then at least grotesquely ill-advised.Continue reading this story at TomDispatchREAD MORE AFGHANISTAN NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Afghanistan FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE AND ITS WORK BY SUBSCRIBING AND BECOMING A MEMBER @  21WIRE.TV",US_News,"July 4, 2017",1

Romanian protesters halt building of Xmas fair at protest site,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romanian protesters clashed with riot police on Saturday when they stopped construction workers from building a Christmas fair at the site of anti-corruption demonstrations in Bucharest. Victory Square saw big street protests at the beginning of the year following attempts by the ruling Social Democrats to decriminalize some corruption offences and has been a gathering place for largely peaceful protests since.  Further demonstrations have been announced on social media  as parliament gears up to approve a judicial overhaul that has been criticized by thousands of magistrates, centrist President Klaus Iohannis, the European Commission and the U.S. State Department. Earlier this week Bucharest mayor Gabriela Firea, a senior Social Democrat member, said she would stage a Christmas fair for most of December in the square - a decision which Social Democrat Prime Minister Mihai Tudose said was not  the most inspired.  On Saturday, protesters began dismantling the scaffolding and fences  for the fair, waving flags and chanting  We won t give Victory Square up,  and  Firea, don t forget, this square is not yours.  Three protesters were taken to a police station, riot police spokesman Georgian Enache told state news agency Agerpres. He added one of them was accused of hitting another citizen.  We are asking Bucharest city hall to abandon immediately ... the move to fence in Victory square,  protest activists said in a statement on Facebook page Corruption Kills.  We urge citizens to protest firmly but non-violently. We must stop this treacherous and rudimentary attempt by mayor Gabriela Firea to discourage protests at a time when they will be crucial for the future of this country.   This means the beginning of anarchy,  Firea said in a statement later. She said she would find another place to locate the fair.  If the capital s city hall was prevented from organizing an event in a public space which belongs to everyone today, similar events could happen tomorrow at the presidential office, parliament and other public institutions.

Pope meets Myanmar's military chief in shadow of Rohingya crisis,"YANGON (Reuters) - Pope Francis held talks on Monday with Myanmar s military chief at the start of a delicate visit to a majority-Buddhist country that the United States has accused of  ethnic cleansing  against its Muslim Rohingya people. The leader of the Roman Catholic church will also visit Bangladesh, where more than 620,000 Rohingya have fled to escape what Amnesty International has called  crimes against humanity . Myanmar s army has denied accusations of murder, rape, torture and forced displacement that have been made against it. The pope s first meeting in Yangon was with military commander Senior General Min Aung Hlaing in St. Mary s Cathedral in the heart of the Southeast Asian nation s largest city.  They discussed the great responsibility of authorities of the country in this time of transition,  Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said after the 15 minutes of talks, which were followed by an exchange of gifts. Francis presented the general with a commemorative medal of his visit, and Min Aung Hlaing gave the pope a harp in the shape of a boat and an ornate rice bowl, Burke said. The army chief told the pope that  there s no religious discrimination in Myanmar and there s the freedom of religion,  according to a statement on the Facebook page of Min Aung Hlaing.  Every soldier s goal is to build a stable and peaceful country,  the army chief was paraphrased as saying in the statement.  Members of ethnic minority groups in traditional dress welcomed Francis at Yangon airport, and children presented him with flowers as he stepped off his plane. He waved through an open window at dozens of children waving Vatican and Myanmar flags and wearing T-shirts with the motto of the trip    love and peace    as he set off in a car. Only about 700,000 of Myanmar s 51 million people are Roman Catholic. Thousands of them traveled by train and bus to Yangon, and they joined crowds at several roadside points along the way from the airport to catch a glimpse of the pope. More than 150,000 people have registered for a mass that Francis will say in Yangon on Wednesday, according to Catholic Myanmar Church spokesman Mariano Soe Naing.   We come here to see the Holy Father. It happens once in hundreds of years,  said Win Min Set, a community leader who brought a group of 1,800 Catholics from the south and west of the country.   He is very knowledgeable when it comes to political affairs. He will handle the issue smartly,  he said, referring to the sensitivity of the pope s discussions about the Rohingya. Large numbers of riot police were mobilized in Yangon but there were no signs of any protests. The trip is so delicate that some papal advisers have warned Francis against even saying the word  Rohingya , lest he set off a diplomatic incident that could turn the country s military and government against minority Christians. The Rohingya exodus from Rakhine state to Bangladesh s southern tip began at the end of August, when Rohingya militants attacked security posts and the Myanmar army launched a counter-offensive. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last week called the military operation  ethnic cleansing  and threatened targeted sanctions for  horrendous atrocities . Myanmar s government has denied most of the accusations made against it, and the army says its own investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing by troops. Myanmar does not recognize the Rohingya as citizens nor as members of a distinct ethnic group with their own identity, and it even rejects the term  Rohingya  and its use. Many people in Myanmar instead refer to members of the Muslim minority in Rakhine state as illegal migrants from Bangladesh.  Francis is expected to meet a group of Rohingya refugees in Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh, on the second leg of his trip. The most tense moments of his Myanmar visit were expected to be the private meeting with the army chief and, separately, with civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Tuesday. Vatican sources say some in the Holy See believe the trip was decided too hastily after full diplomatic ties were established in May during a visit by Suu Kyi. Suu Kyi s reputation as a Nobel Peace Prize laureate has been tarnished because she has expressed doubts about the reports of rights abuses against the Rohingya and failed to condemn the military. The pope has already used the word Rohingya in two appeals from the Vatican this year.  Asked if he would say it in Myanmar, Burke said Francis was taking the advice he had been given seriously, but added:  We will find out together during the trip ... it is not a forbidden word . A hardline group of Buddhist monks, previously known as Ma Ba Tha, said it welcomed the pope s visit but warned, without elaborating, of  a response  if he spoke openly about the Rohingya.  I hope he doesn t touch on sensitive issues that Myanmar people couldn t accept,  said Tawparka, a spokesman for the group, who goes by a single name.  There s no problem if he talks about Islam, but it s unacceptable if he speaks about Rohingya and extreme terrorists.  ",worldnews,"November 27, 2017 ",0
 What Will Rick Snyder Tell Congress About Poisoning The Water Of Flint’s Black Children?,"Michigan governor Rick Snyder is being called to appear before a congressional hearing about how the city of Flint s water supply was poisoned with lead.Snyder, a Republican, made the call on changing the city s source of water in order to save money. As a result, thousands in the mostly black city have been affected.A spokeswoman for the committee did not immediately return a request for comment on the hearing, which would be the first congressional inquiry into the crisis. President Barack Obama signed an emergency designation for Genesee County and Flint last Saturday and the Federal Emergency Management Agency is supplying water and water filters to residents.Lawrence, D-Southfield, a week ago sent a letter to leaders of the committee, of which she is a member, asking for the hearing, saying it s Congress  responsibility to address  a man-made disaster created by the poor policy decisions of elected and career government officials. Snyder s office was pushed by national criticism to release internal emails about how they responded to the water crisis, and though some of those emails were redacted to the point of absurdity, they also reveal that early concerns about the water were downplayed and ridiculed:A top aide to Michigan s governor referred to people raising questions about the quality of Flint s water as an  anti-everything group.  Other critics were accused of turning complaints about water into a  political football.  And worrisome findings about lead by a concerned pediatrician were dismissed as  data,  in quotes.Hillary Clinton dispatched officials from her campaign to go to Michigan to speak to local officials about the water problems, while Senator Bernie Sanders has called for Governor Snyder to resign.While visiting Michigan, President Obama said the damage to the community was  inexplicable and inexcusable. By contrast, Donald Trump refused to speak about the water issue.Featured image via Twitter",News,"January 21, 2016",1
"Nerve agent VX found on shirts of women accused of North Korean murder, expert says","KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Traces of a deadly nerve agent that killed the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un were found on the clothes worn by the two women accused of the sensational murder, a Malaysian court was told on Thursday. Indonesian Siti Aisyah, 25, and Doan Thi Huong, 28, a Vietnamese, are charged with murdering Kim Jong Nam by smearing his face with VX, a chemical poison banned by the United Nations, at Kuala Lumpur airport on Feb. 13. A chemical weapons expert with the Malaysian government said his analysis showed traces of VX, its precursors and degradation products on the sleeves of a T-shirt worn by Huong, as well as VX degradation products on Siti Aisyah s sleeveless shirt.      The presence of precursors and VX confirms the presence of VX itself,  the expert, Raja Subramaniam, told the court outside the Malaysian capital.  I also found degradation products of VX, which confirms the presence of VX.  The testimony was used to back the prosecution s position that VX was used in the murder and was the sole cause of death, a scenario defense lawyers disputed this week. [nL4N1ME159] In response to a prosecution question, Raja agreed that VX could be applied on a bare palm and potentially have no effect on a person if washed off quickly enough. The lethality of VX depended on the dosage and where on the body it was applied, he added.  The concentration required varies by a factor of 26, from the cheek, which is sensitive, to the palm, which is least sensitive, to have the same effect,  Raja said. Raja said penetration of VX into the body is highest in areas with higher concentrations of blood, such as the head, neck, eyes and ears. On the least sensitive areas, such as the palm, where larger amounts of tissue and fat deposits block absorption, Raja said an individual would have up to 15 minutes to wash off the nerve poison with running water.  If you decontaminate within 15 minutes, most likely no effect or delayed effect (from VX),  Raja said, citing studies on human test subjects. The women have pleaded not guilty, saying they thought they were involved in some sort of prank for a reality TV show. They face the death penalty if convicted. [nL4N1MD1MK] The trial will resume on Monday. ",worldnews,"October 5, 2017 ",0
"Daimler AG, Ferrari selling some new vehicles with faulty air bags: U.S. Senate report","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz USA and Daimler Vans units and Ferrari NV are among a small group of automakers selling some new vehicles with faulty Takata airbags that will be subject to recalls by the end of 2018, a U.S. Senate report said on Wednesday. The vehicles are legal to sell since the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has said they will not become potentially unsafe until exposed to high humidity for an extended period. Safety advocates and some in Congress have criticized the sale of vehicles that will be recalled. Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, said the vehicles include the 2016 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter and 2016-2017 Mercedes-Benz E-Class Coupe/Convertible and numerous 2016 and 2017 Ferrari models including the FF, California T, 488 GTB/488 Spider, F12/F12tdf and GTC4 Lusso. Nelson said the report underscores “the failure of certain automakers and regulators to level with people about the true extent of the problem and to have the cars fixed before they’re sold.” Mercedes Benz USA spokeswoman Donna Boland said the company has told regulators that its “dealers will be informing prospective buyers of the pending recall on these models at the time of purchase in the very near future.” Ferrari spokeswoman Krista Florin said the Italian automaker also plans to notify customers of the future recalls.Seven out of 17 automakers Nelson contacted have admitted to equipping some new vehicles with defective Takata airbags, including Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE). All agreed to notify buyers of the planned recalls. Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) is the only automaker that has not provided a written response, Nelson said. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday from Reuters. NHTSA said in May Tesla would be required to recall vehicles for Takata inflators. Takata inflators can explode with excessive force and spray metal shrapnel. They are suspected in at least 13 deaths worldwide and more than 100 injuries. In May, Takata agreed to declare as defective, by 2018, another 35 million to 40 million U.S. inflators that lack drying agents in frontal airbags after 14 automakers previously recalled more than 24 million U.S. vehicles. Worldwide nearly 100 million inflators have been declared defective. NHTSA said there have been no ruptures in vehicles built since 2008. According to NHTSA, the vehicles do not become vulnerable to exploding airbags without long-term exposure to high humidity. In the short-term, the agency says, they are safe to drive and much safer than older models. ",politicsNews,"July 20, 2016 ",0
KILL LIST OF REPUBLICANS Found On Body Of James Hodgkinson…The Dem Hate-Speech Is Working,"The deranged shooter who tried to kill Republican Congressmen practicing at a baseball field in Alexandria, Virginia was carrying a  kill list  of  Republicans including Alabama Rep.

If the Democrats aren t convinced their vitriolic speech is motivating people to violence, this is yet another example of the targeting of conservatives and Republican lawmakers that s been going on since Trump announced his candidacy.Who can forget the egg in the face of a trump supporter or the assaults of numerous people at rallies in support of candidate Trump. Since Trump won, the hate and violence has continued from the inauguration to the Berkeley Antifa riots.Note to Democrat leaders: You own this!Hodgkinson spewed left-wing talking points on Facebook, consistently railing against Republicans and the wealthy: We all know that the rich don t pay enough taxes.

Neapolitan pizza making wins world heritage status,"JEJU, South Korea (Reuters) - The art of Neapolitan pizza making won world heritage status on Thursday, joining a horse-riding game from Iran and Dutch wind mills on UNESCO s culture list. UNESCO accepted the art of Neapolitan  pizzaiuoli,  or pizza makers, on the world body s list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.  Congratulations #Italy!  it said in a tweet after a meeting in Jeju, South Korea where the decision was made. Italy argued the practice of the  pizzaiuoli  - preparing and flipping the dough, topping it and baking it in a wood-fired oven - was part of the country s cultural and gastronomic tradition. In Rome, pizzeria owner Romano Fiore celebrated the decision.  I am honored, like all Italians and Neapolitans are...pizza has centuries of history,  he said.  Archetypal Neapolitan pizza has a relatively thin crust with the exception of the rim, which, when baked, bloats like a tiny bicycle tire. It is made in a wood-burning brick oven and has two classic versions: Marinara (tomato, garlic, oregano and oil) and, the most famous, Margherita (tomato, mozzarella, oil and basil), giving it the red, white and green colors of the Italian flag. Tradition holds that the Margherita pizza was created in 1889 by a local chef in honor of Queen Margherita, who was visiting Naples, south of Rome on Italy s Tyrrhenian coast.  As pizza has become a favorite dish around the world, foreign innovations in toppings have often left Italians perplexed and aghast.  Matteo Martino, a customer at Fiore s pizzeria, said before the expected announcement,  I think, and I hope, that this could be the chance to make foreigners understand how pizza is made, without Nutella or pineapple.  UNESCO also accepted Chogan, an Iranian horse-riding game accompanied by music and storytelling, and the craft of millers operating windmills and watermills in the Netherlands. Traditional boat making on the Indonesian island of South Sulawesi, and Nsima, a maize-based culinary tradition from the African country of Malawi, also joined the list. Food culture already on the UNESCO list includes Turkish coffee culture and tradition, the gingerbread craft of northern Croatia and the traditional ancient Georgian method of Qvevri wine-making.

Russia's Olympic ban strengthens Putin's re-election hand,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Opinion polls show Vladimir Putin is already a shoo-in to win a fourth presidential term. But a ban on Russia taking part in the Winter Olympics is likely to make support for him even stronger, by uniting voters around his message: The world is against us. Putin announced on Wednesday that he would run for re-election in March s presidential vote, setting the stage for him to extend his dominance of Russia s political landscape into a third decade. With ties between the Kremlin and the West at their lowest point for years, the International Olympic Committee s decision to bar Russia from the 2018 Pyeongchang Games over doping is seen in Moscow as a humiliating and politically tinged act. Putin, echoing his familiar refrain that his country is facing a treacherous Western campaign to hold it back, said he had  no doubt  that the IOC s decision was  absolutely orchestrated and politically-motivated .  Russia will continue moving forwards, and nobody will ever be able to stop this forward movement,  Putin said. Konstantin Kosachyov, head of the upper house of parliament s foreign affairs committee, had been among the first to cast the move as part of a Western plot against Russia, which sees sport as a barometer of geopolitical influence.  They are targeting our national honor ... our reputation ... and our interests. They (the West) bought out the traitors ... and orchestrated media hysteria,  Kosachyov wrote on social media. The IOC ruling is also seen by many in Russia as a personal affront to Putin, who was re-elected president in 2012 after  spending four years as prime minister because the constitution barred him from a third consecutive term as head of state.  The sport-loving leader cast his hosting of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, at which the IOC says there was  unprecedented systematic manipulation  of the anti-doping system, as a symbol of Russia s success under his rule. But Putin has often extracted political benefit from crises, and turned international setbacks into domestic triumphs, by accusing the West of gunning for Russia and using this to inspire Russians to unite.  Outside pressure on Russia, understood as politically motivated and orchestrated from the U.S., leads to more national cohesion,  Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, said on Wednesday.  Various sanctions are being turned into instruments of nation-building.  Putin s popularity, supported by state television, is already high. Opinion polls regularly give him an approval rating of around 80 percent.  But casting the IOC ban as a Western plot to hurt Russia, something he did when Russian athletes were banned from last year s Summer Olympics in Rio over doping, could help him mobilize the electorate. Public anger over the IOC move could help Putin overcome signs of voter apathy and ensure a high turnout which, in the tightly controlled limits of the Russian political system, is seen as conferring legitimacy. There were early signs that fury over the IOC s decision was duly stirring patriotic fervor.  Russia is a superpower,  Alexander Kudrashov, a member of the Russian Military Historical Society, told Reuters on Moscow s Red Square after the IOC ruling. Without Russia, he said, the Olympics would not be valid.  He linked the decision to a Western anti-Russian campaign which many Russians believe took hold after Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.    Choosing between the people in Crimea, who wept when the Russian flag was run up and who were doomed to genocide, and  sportspeople taking first place on the podium, I choose the people who couldn t defend themselves,  Kudrashov said.    Blaming the West is an approach the Kremlin has often used before when faced with international allegations of wrongdoing   over Crimea s annexation, the shooting down of a Malaysian passenger plane over Ukraine in July 2014 and charges of meddling in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists  rebelled against rule from Kiev after Crimea was annexed. The tactic taps into Russians  patriotism and makes Putin almost bullet-proof when it comes to scandal. The 65-year-old former KGB agent is regarded by many voters as a tsar-like father-of-the-nation figure who has brought their country back from the brink of collapse.  When at the start of the year it seemed there was a window to repair relations with the West after the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he wanted better ties, the narrative of Russia versus the world was muted.  But when it became clear that U.S. allegations of Russian meddling in Trump s election precluded any rapprochement, Putin doubled down on the narrative. In October, he launched a stinging critique of U.S. policy, listing what he called the biggest betrayals in U.S.-Russia relations.  Sources close to the Russian government say the IOC ban, along with continued Western sanctions over Ukraine and the prospect of new sanctions, will help the authorities rally voters around the banner of national unity which Putin embodies.  Outside pressure just makes us stronger,  said one such source who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry, set the tone on social media in comments that found ready support from many Russians.  What haven t we been forced to suffer from our  partners  in the course of our history,  she wrote.  But they just can t bring us down. Not via a world war, the collapse of the Soviet Union or sanctions ... We soak it up and survive.  ",worldnews,"December 6, 2017 ",0

Some of the things he s been accused of by the women are so disgusting and predatory. He repeatedly rubbed his genitals on 3 different women that was his mojo. He is a special kind of arrogant jerk who preyed on young women using his authority. He got a suspension from MSNBC until they can sort this all out Get the barf bucket out, this guy is a disgusting pig:Longtime political journalist Mark Halperin is out at MSBNC following accusations that he sexually harassed five women while head of ABC News. We find the story and the allegations very troubling. Mark Halperin is leaving his role as a contributor until the questions around his past conduct are fully understood,  MSNBC told Fox News in a statement.Halperin, the co-author of best-selling book  Game Change,  was accused in a CNN report of groping the women in the 2000s while he worked as ABC News  political director.The women told CNN that the 52-year-old reporter propositioned them for sex, grabbed their breasts and rubbed his erection on three of them.

" AZ Republican Calls Cops On Constituents Delivering Cookies, Claims They Set Cars On Fire","If anything more than a grunt passes between the lips of a Republican, one can typically be assured he or she is lying   and that was the case when a group of constituents delivered cookies to Arizona Rep. David Schweikert.A group of citizens  members of a group called AZ Indivisible   showed up outside Schweikert s office earlier this year hoping to bribe him into hearing their concerns. Instead, the Congressman had his staff call the police.While we can t be sure if he told the cops the same story he is telling his supporters, a letter his office sent out says that the cookie-delivering citizens  incite violence  and  light cars on fire  as they  clash with police  because they will  stop at no turn. The left is determined to disrupt and disorganize. They are organizing new groups every single day and investing big resources neighborhood-to-neighborhood across Maricopa County,  the letter begins   then it becomes (more) insane:Despite the Congressman s allegations, Scottsdale police officer Kevin Watts says that There have been no reports of violence, clashes with our officers or incidents of criminal damage associated with Representative Schweikert s office to date. In other words Schweikert, like seemingly all Republicans, is a liar. The people belonging to the groups referenced are mostly women, mostly have more than a few years on them   The most dangerous physical weapons we have are knitting needles. But make no mistake   We vote   We are actively encouraging others to vote, and lots of us are educating ourselves on how politics works and running for office,  a member of Indivisible told The Republic.  Does this sound like people plotting violence? We are working within the system. Sadly, this sort of behavior is typical of Republicans: you ask them questions, you expect them to be held accountable, you try to get a little face time to discuss actual issues   and they respond by lying about you.Featured image via screengrab",News,"June 12, 2017",1

U.S. Senate approves Chao to lead Transportation Department,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Elaine Chao, a former top U.S. labor official, was sworn in on Tuesday to lead the U.S. Transportation Department, which overseas aviation, vehicle, train and pipeline safety. Chao, a former U.S. labor secretary and deputy transportation secretary, took office hours after the U.S. Senate voted 93 to 6 to confirm her. Chao, 63, will face key decisions on how to regulate the growing use of drones and automakers’ plans to offer self-driving cars.   She will also be a key player in President Donald Trump’s Cabinet if his administration pushes ahead with a major infrastructure spending program, as the businessman-turned-politician promised during last year’s presidential campaign. “Your leadership and your experience will serve well as the secretary of transportation, overseeing what we anticipate will be historic investments in our nation’s roads, bridges, airports and above all in our future,” said Vice President Mike Pence, who administered the oath of office to Chao. Chao tweeted: “It is an honor to rejoin the extraordinary people of @USDOT and begin working to rebuild America’s infrastructure.” The Transportation Department has a $75 billion annual budget and about 60,000 employees. It includes the Federal Aviation Administration, which handles air traffic control. Chao, the wife of Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position, also will have to decide whether U.S. fuel efficiency standards should be revised, as some automakers have sought. There are dozens of other pending regulatory issues facing the next administration, including railroad safety and staffing rules and whether to set rules requiring airlines to give more passengers with disabilities seats with extra leg room and whether to ban or restrict personal phone calls on U.S. flights. At her confirmation hearing this month, Chao declined to take positions on a number of issues, including whether air traffic control jobs should be privatized, concerns over the safety of shipments of crude oil by rail, foreign airlines’ push to move into the U.S. market and regulation of developing technologies. AAA, the largest U.S. auto club with more than 50 million members, praised Chao’s confirmation. AAA CEO Marshall Doney said the group “firmly believes that significant, additional investments are needed to maintain existing infrastructure and to enhance the nation’s (transportation) system.” The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents major U.S. and foreign automakers, said that from “autonomous vehicles to safety to fuel efficiency to infrastructure, Secretary Chao’s leadership will profoundly impact our sector and many others.” ",politicsNews,"January 31, 2017 ",0
"Brazil's new top prosecutor is sworn in, says will maintain graft fight","BRASILIA (Reuters) - The new prosecutor general tasked with leading Brazil s anti-corruption drive was sworn in on Monday, and said she would continue her predecessor s campaign against graft in Latin America s biggest nation. Raquel Dodge took over as head of the prosecutor-general s office from Rodrigo Janot, during whose tenure investigators uncovered Brazil s largest graft scheme, involving billions of dollars in political kickbacks in return for contracts at state-run companies. In brief remarks at the prosecutor-general headquarters in capital, Brasilia, Dodge said that the Brazilian people expected her to carry on cleaning up corruption.  The people maintain their hope for a better nation, they are interested in the nation s destiny,  she said.  They are following the investigations and trials, they will not tolerate corruption and do not just wait on results, but demand them.       As Janot s four-year term as prosecutor-general drew to an end, Brazil s entire body of federal prosecutors cast ballots for his replacement.  Dodge came second in the vote, but under Brazilian law the president has the final word in selecting the nominee. President Michel Temer chose Dodge, who was confirmed by the Senate two weeks later in July.  Her nomination was backed by the core team of federal prosecutors who have uncovered the worst of Brazil s graft, which centered on state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro.  Janot lodged three corruption charges against Temer. One, for allegedly taking bribes, was blocked by the lower house of Congress in early August. Under Brazilian law, a president can only be tried before the Supreme Court if two-thirds of federal deputies vote to allow it.  Last week, Janot filed two more charges against Temer, one for racketeering and the other for obstruction of justice.      The criminal charges filed against the president were based on the plea-bargain testimony of the owners of the world s largest meatpacker, JBS SA. They accused Temer of taking bribes in return for political favors and of conspiring to buy the silence of a witness who could implicate him. Temer has repeatedly said he was innocent and accused Janot of running a political witch hunt against him. At Dodge s swearing-in ceremony, Temer said that  supreme authority is not found in officials, but in the law.   ",worldnews,"September 18, 2017 ",0
 Trump Humiliates Himself And Wastes Time At G-20 Summit By Throwing A Twitter Tantrum About Hillary’s Emails,"Incapable of putting his f*cking phone down during an important overseas trip, Donald Trump embarrassed our country again by going on a tirade on Twitter.Hours ahead of a meeting with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, Trump chose to post a rant on Twitter rather than prepare for what could end up being a disastrous exchange with the man who ordered the interference in the 2016 Election.My experience yesterday in Poland was a great one. Thank you to everyone, including the haters, for the great reviews of the speech!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 7, 2017Just to recap, Trump s speech included white supremacist code words such as  western values.  Trump also insulted the Polish people by downplaying the horrific experiences they suffered during World War II.On top of that, Trump attacked President Obama during a press conference and was snubbed by the Polish First Lady when he tried to shake her hand. Trump s visit to Poland was embarrassing, not  great. Trump then claimed that  everyone  is talking about Hillary Clinton s emails at the G-20.Everyone here is talking about why John Podesta refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the CIA. Disgraceful!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 7, 2017This is incredibly doubtful. World leaders have way more important things to talk about. It s likely that Trump is the only one talking about Hillary s emails while the rest of the attendees are concerned with how Trump s meeting with Putin will affect Europe and NATO. After all, Trump still owes his puppet master a favor for putting him in the White House.Trump then ended his hissy fit by attacking the media.I will represent our country well and fight for its interests!

Hey Packers and Bears: We Don’t Lock Arms for the National Anthem! [Video],"Last night s game between the Bears and Packers is usually a fun-filled event that s become a huge tradition for football fans everywhere. Last night was no exception!The stadium was filled with fans who chanted USA, USA! The fans were ready to see hand over heart during the national anthem but got something very disappointing instead. The players from both teams tried to split the difference and stand for the anthem while locking arms. Outraged fans considered it just as much a protest as taking a knee, the gesture made famous by former San Francisco 49ers player Colin Kaepernick who kicked off the protest last year. I am so ashamed of and appalled by the ignorance of any NFL player who would dare disgrace our Stars and Stripes or the memory of hundreds of thousands of fallen U.S. heroes who paid with their lives so that we may live free,  Packers shareholder and 20-year U.S. Air Force veteran Steven Tiefenthaler told the Green Bay Press-Gazette.Packers fans are in a unique position to have their voices heard because unlike the privately owned 31 other NFL teams, theirs is divvied up among over 360,000 fans who own over 5 million shares of the franchise. The division mirrored the stand-off between NFL players and President Trump who last week called for any athlete who kneels during the anthem to be fired.Read more: Daily Mail",politics,"Sep 29, 2017",1

LIST OF 22 TIMES OBAMA Called Phony Climate Change More Serious Than Terrorism,"Oh the irony of a terror attack by Muslims taking place on American soil on the heels of Obama s return from phony Climate Change Summit in Paris ISIS has taken responsibility for the horrifying attacks in Paris that have left more than 150 dead and hundreds wounded. French President Francois Hollande is calling for the closure of his country s borders. President Barack Obama didn t condemn Islamic radicals for the attacks, but he did call them  an outrageous attempt to terrorize innocent civilians  and  an attack on all of humanity and the universal values we share. Friday s deadly attacks thwarted Al Gore s long-planned Paris webcast and star-studded concert to promote climate change awareness. Out of solidarity with the French people and the City of Paris, we have decided to suspend our broadcast of 24 Hours of Reality and Live Earth,  the group said in an online statement.Coincidentally, in July 2008, Al Gore called climate change a more dangerous threat than terrorism.  I think that the climate crisis is, by far, the most serious threat we have ever faced,  Gore told ABC News.Below are 22 times Obama or his administration officials claimed climate change a greater threat than radical Islamic terrorism.In a January 15, 2008 presidential campaign speech on Iraq and Afghanistan, Barack Obama said the  immediate danger  of oil-backed terrorism  is eclipsed only by the long-term threat from climate change, which will lead to devastating weather patterns, terrible storms, drought, and famine. That means people competing for food and water in the next fifty years in the very places that have known horrific violence in the last fifty: Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. Most disastrously, that could mean destructive storms on our shores, and the disappearance of our coastline. On January 26, 2009, Obama delivered remarks at the White House on the  dangers  of climate change:These urgent dangers to our national and economic security are compounded by the long-term threat of climate change, which, if left unchecked, could result in violent conflict, terrible storms, shrinking coastlines, and irreversible catastrophe.In May 2010, the Obama White House released it s national security strategy, which said,  At home and abroad, we are taking concerted action to confront the dangers posed by climate change and to strengthen our energy security.  The document declared climate change  an urgent and growing threat to our national security. On September 6, 2012, during his Democratic National Convention speech, Obama said,  Yes, my plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet, because climate change is not a hoax. More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke. They are a threat to our children s future.On January 23, 2013, in an address before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary of State John Kerry declared climate change among the top threats facing the United States.February 16, 2014, Secretary of State John Kerry addressed students in Indonesia and said that global warming is now  perhaps the world s most fearsome weapon of mass destruction. In a June 2014 interview, Obama said:When you start seeing how these shifts can displace people entire countries can be finding themselves unable to feed themselves and the potential incidence of conflict that arises out of that that gets your attention. There s a reason why the quadrennial defense review which the secretary of defense and the Joints Chiefs of Staff work on identified climate change as one of our most significant national security problems. It s not just the actual disasters that might arise, it is the accumulating stresses that are placed on a lot of different countries and the possibility of war, conflict, refugees, displacement that arise from a changing climate.During a September 2014 meeting with foreign ministers, Secretary of State John Kerry called Climate change a threat as urgent as ISIS.On September 24 2014, the Obama USDA launched its Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture. In a memo posted by Secretary of State John Kerry, among other Obama administration officials, read, From India to the United States, climate change poses drastic risks to every facet of our lives. On October 29, 2014, in an address to the Washington Ideas Forum, Obama s Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said:From my perspective, within the portfolio that I have responsibility for security of this country climate change presents security issues for us. There s a security dynamic to that. As the oceans increase, it will affect our bases. It will affect islands. It will affect security across the world. Just from my narrow perspective, what I have responsibility for, that s happening now.During his 2015 State of the Union address, Obama said,  No challenge  poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change. In a February 2015 address to college students in Iowa, Vice President Joe Biden said  Global warming is the greatest threat to your generation of anything at all, across the board. On February 09, 2015, in an interview with Vox, Obama said he  absolutely  believes that the media  sometimes overstates the level of alarm people should have about terrorism  as opposed to  climate change. On February 10, 2015, when asked to confirm if this means Obama believes  the threat of climate change is greater than the threat of terrorism,  Earnest responded,  The point the president is making is that there are many more people on an annual basis who have to confront the impact, the direct impact on their lives, of climate change, or on the spread of a disease, than on terrorism. During his April 18, 2015 weekly address on climate change, Obama said,  Wednesday is Earth Day, a day to appreciate and protect this precious planet we call home. And today, there s no greater threat to our planet than climate change. In May 2015, the White House released a 1,300-page National Climate Assessment that declared climate change among the world s foremost threats.May 20, 2015 President Obama said in his keynote address to the U.S. Coast Guard Academy graduates:  Climate change, and especially rising seas, is a threat to our homeland security, our economic infrastructure, the safety and health of the American people. On July 13 2015, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator Gina McCarthy and Obama s U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican Kenneth F.

"Philippines seeks big cut in drug rehab budget, stoking lawmakers' concern","MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines plans a cut of 75 percent in spending next year on drug rehabilitation facilities, while at the same time seeking a massive hike in funding for a war on drugs that has killed thousands, fuelling concerns among lawmakers.  The government has rejected criticism that it lacked the commitment to rehabilitate drug users, saying it has attracted financing and is building treatment facilities, but had underestimated the scale of addiction.   More than 3,800 people, most of them drugs suspects, have died in police operations in the drug war unleashed by President Rodrigo Duterte in July last year. Police deny they were executing suspects, saying those killed had violently resisted arrest. Senator Ralph Recto, who has questioned the government s anti-drugs budget, said he would scrutinize its proposal to cut expenditure on drug rehabilitation centers by 2.3 billion pesos ($45.23 million), compared to this year. The government has asked Congress for an increase of more than 40 times in next year s police budget for anti-drugs operations next year.  I will discuss these issues when the budget is formally presented,  Recto told Reuters in a text message. The lack of rehabilitation centers would cripple the  declared government policy  to wean substance abusers off drugs, Recto said in a statement over the weekend.     In August, Health Secretary Paulyn Ubial said eight drug rehabilitation centers would be built across the Philippines, funded by private firms, including conglomerate San Miguel Corp and property firm Megaworld. Last year, Manila opened what it called a  mega  drug rehabilitation facility to treat up to 10,000 patients and funded by a Chinese tycoon.  The Department of Health submitted a budget of 759.6 million pesos for state-managed rehabilitation facilities under the government s proposed 2018 spending plan, significantly less than this year s budget of 3.08 billion pesos. Methamphetamine use for a year or more would shrink the brain of a person, Duterte said in a speech in August last year, adding,  Therefore he is no longer viable for rehabilitation.  He estimated there are already more than 3 million Philippine drug users in a country of more than 100 million people.  The government s 13 drug abuse treatment and rehab facilities treated 14,733 out-patients in 2016, up more than three times from the previous year, and close to 30,000 in- patients, up four percent over 2015, the health department says.   Duterte has said the drugs war will continue and would be  unremitting as it will be unrelenting . ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",0
LIST OF 22 TIMES OBAMA Called Phony Climate Change More Serious Than Terrorism,"Oh the irony of a terror attack by Muslims taking place on American soil on the heels of Obama s return from phony Climate Change Summit in Paris ISIS has taken responsibility for the horrifying attacks in Paris that have left more than 150 dead and hundreds wounded. French President Francois Hollande is calling for the closure of his country s borders. President Barack Obama didn t condemn Islamic radicals for the attacks, but he did call them  an outrageous attempt to terrorize innocent civilians  and  an attack on all of humanity and the universal values we share. Friday s deadly attacks thwarted Al Gore s long-planned Paris webcast and star-studded concert to promote climate change awareness. Out of solidarity with the French people and the City of Paris, we have decided to suspend our broadcast of 24 Hours of Reality and Live Earth,  the group said in an online statement.Coincidentally, in July 2008, Al Gore called climate change a more dangerous threat than terrorism.  I think that the climate crisis is, by far, the most serious threat we have ever faced,  Gore told ABC News.Below are 22 times Obama or his administration officials claimed climate change a greater threat than radical Islamic terrorism.In a January 15, 2008 presidential campaign speech on Iraq and Afghanistan, Barack Obama said the  immediate danger  of oil-backed terrorism  is eclipsed only by the long-term threat from climate change, which will lead to devastating weather patterns, terrible storms, drought, and famine. That means people competing for food and water in the next fifty years in the very places that have known horrific violence in the last fifty: Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. Most disastrously, that could mean destructive storms on our shores, and the disappearance of our coastline. On January 26, 2009, Obama delivered remarks at the White House on the  dangers  of climate change:These urgent dangers to our national and economic security are compounded by the long-term threat of climate change, which, if left unchecked, could result in violent conflict, terrible storms, shrinking coastlines, and irreversible catastrophe.In May 2010, the Obama White House released it s national security strategy, which said,  At home and abroad, we are taking concerted action to confront the dangers posed by climate change and to strengthen our energy security.  The document declared climate change  an urgent and growing threat to our national security. On September 6, 2012, during his Democratic National Convention speech, Obama said,  Yes, my plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet, because climate change is not a hoax. More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke. They are a threat to our children s future.On January 23, 2013, in an address before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary of State John Kerry declared climate change among the top threats facing the United States.February 16, 2014, Secretary of State John Kerry addressed students in Indonesia and said that global warming is now  perhaps the world s most fearsome weapon of mass destruction. In a June 2014 interview, Obama said:When you start seeing how these shifts can displace people entire countries can be finding themselves unable to feed themselves and the potential incidence of conflict that arises out of that that gets your attention. There s a reason why the quadrennial defense review which the secretary of defense and the Joints Chiefs of Staff work on identified climate change as one of our most significant national security problems. It s not just the actual disasters that might arise, it is the accumulating stresses that are placed on a lot of different countries and the possibility of war, conflict, refugees, displacement that arise from a changing climate.During a September 2014 meeting with foreign ministers, Secretary of State John Kerry called Climate change a threat as urgent as ISIS.On September 24 2014, the Obama USDA launched its Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture. In a memo posted by Secretary of State John Kerry, among other Obama administration officials, read, From India to the United States, climate change poses drastic risks to every facet of our lives. On October 29, 2014, in an address to the Washington Ideas Forum, Obama s Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said:From my perspective, within the portfolio that I have responsibility for security of this country climate change presents security issues for us. There s a security dynamic to that. As the oceans increase, it will affect our bases. It will affect islands. It will affect security across the world. Just from my narrow perspective, what I have responsibility for, that s happening now.During his 2015 State of the Union address, Obama said,  No challenge  poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change. In a February 2015 address to college students in Iowa, Vice President Joe Biden said  Global warming is the greatest threat to your generation of anything at all, across the board. On February 09, 2015, in an interview with Vox, Obama said he  absolutely  believes that the media  sometimes overstates the level of alarm people should have about terrorism  as opposed to  climate change. On February 10, 2015, when asked to confirm if this means Obama believes  the threat of climate change is greater than the threat of terrorism,  Earnest responded,  The point the president is making is that there are many more people on an annual basis who have to confront the impact, the direct impact on their lives, of climate change, or on the spread of a disease, than on terrorism. During his April 18, 2015 weekly address on climate change, Obama said,  Wednesday is Earth Day, a day to appreciate and protect this precious planet we call home. And today, there s no greater threat to our planet than climate change. In May 2015, the White House released a 1,300-page National Climate Assessment that declared climate change among the world s foremost threats.May 20, 2015 President Obama said in his keynote address to the U.S. Coast Guard Academy graduates:  Climate change, and especially rising seas, is a threat to our homeland security, our economic infrastructure, the safety and health of the American people. On July 13 2015, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator Gina McCarthy and Obama s U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican Kenneth F. Hackett wrote in a joint blog post on the EPA website, praising Pope Francis for dedicating his second encyclical to urging swift action on global warming.McCarthy and Hackett wrote:As public servants working in both domestic policy and diplomacy, we understand the urgent need for global action.

Putin critic Navalny calls election boycott rallies,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Opposition leader Alexei Navalny announced on Wednesday a series of rallies across Russia in January to press home his call for a boycott of next year s presidential election, a move likely to draw a sharp response from the Kremlin and police. Navalny unveiled his plan hours after President Vladimir Putin, who polls suggest is a shoo-in for re-election, registered his candidacy at the central election commission ahead of the March 18 vote.  The commission ruled on Monday that Navalny was not eligible to run against Putin due to a suspended prison sentence.  A furious Navalny, who says the sentence was part of a fabricated case designed to thwart his political ambitions, responded by calling for an election boycott. That prompted the Kremlin to demand an investigation to determine whether his statement broke the law. On Wednesday, Navalny upped the ante, saying he and his supporters would organize nationwide rallies on Jan. 28 in 85 towns and cities, including Moscow and St Petersburg, to support his call for an election boycott.  We refuse to call the reappointment of Putin an election,  Navalny said in a statement on his website.   We are not going to vote and will convince everyone around us not to vote. We are going to campaign (for a boycott) with all our might.  A boycott could pose a problem for the Kremlin which is keen to ensure a high turnout in the election to help confer legitimacy on Putin s expected victory amid some signs of apathy among voters. Under Russian law, the time and place of rallies must be agreed with the authorities who have often declined to authorize them in the past, citing conflicting events or security concerns. When the opposition has gone ahead anyway, the police have broken up rallies by force and detained attendees.        Polls show that Putin, who has led Russia for 18 years as either president or prime minister, is on course to comfortably win another six-year term, allowing him to rule until 2024, when he ll turn 72. The former KGB officer is running as an independent, a move seen as a way of strengthening his image as a  father of the nation  rather than as a party political figure. The ruling United Russia party, which he once led and which controls three quarters of seats in the lower house of parliament, has said it will support him, as will Just Russia, a pro-government center-left group. Allies laud Putin for restoring national pride and expanding Moscow s global clout with interventions in Syria and Ukraine. But Navalny says Putin has been in power too long and that his support is artificially maintained by a biased state media and an unfair system which excludes genuine opponents.   Navalny has made a name for himself by successfully leveraging social media and conducting high profile corruption investigations into senior officials. He has also organized some of the biggest anti-government protests in years. Opinion polls, whose accuracy Navalny dismisses, put his support in single digits while giving Putin an approval rating of around 80 percent. ",worldnews,"December 27, 2017 ",0
Rights groups urge UK to request Bahrain free activist's relatives,"DUBAI (Reuters) - A group of 13 human rights organizations urged the British government to call for the release of three Bahrainis detained in the Gulf State, saying they were being punished because they were relatives of a London-based activist and his wife. In a letter sent to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, the group that includes Amnesty International and UK legal charity Reprieve called for the release of Sayed Nazar Alwadaei, Hajar Mansoor Hasan and Mahmood Marzooq Mansoor. The three are relatives of Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei and his wife Duaa Alwadaei. Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei is the director of advocacy at the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, a Britain-based group campaigning for political change in Bahrain. The three were arrested in March in Bahrain while Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei was attending the 34th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.  We therefore urge your government to request Bahrain to immediately release Mr and Mrs Alwadaei s relatives ahead of their October 30 trial and drop all charges against them,  said the letter sent on Thursday. It called the case  part of a pattern of abuse and harassment against human rights defenders and their families in Bahrain . The letter said the three detainees are facing up to three years in jail.  Bahrain is punishing his innocent family as retribution for his peaceful activism,  said Maya Foa, director of Reprieve. Bahrain s government officials could not be immediately reached for a comment. Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei s family members have been under the spotlight of Bahrain s authorities since he took part in protest against the attendance of the Gulf state s king at a royal horse show in Britain. King Hamad attended the Royal Windsor Horse Show last year, and the state-run Bahrain News Agency BNA published his photographs with Britain s Queen Elizabeth II. Bahrain, which has a Shi ite Muslim majority population and is ruled by a Sunni royal family, has seen unrest since the  Arab Spring  protests across the region in 2011.  Many of Bahrain s Shi ites say they suffer discrimination, which the government denies. It accuses Shi ite power Iran of fomenting unrest on its soil, a charged Tehran denies.

Canada’s Immigration Website Crashes After Trump Pulls Ahead," 21st Century Wire says According to reports from Business Insider, the Canadian government s immigration website crashed tonight following reports that Donald Trump was pulling ahead in the US after calling a victory in traditional Democrat stronghold of Wisconsin.Clinton surrogate Miley Cyrus.A number of high profile US liberals had said previously that they would  leave the country  if Trump won the presidency, including actor Bryan Cranston and controversial pop singer Miley Cyrus (photo, left), both of who are staunch Hillary Clinton supporters. The barrage of celebrity Clinton campaigners threatening to leave the US helped to propel this talking point nationwide and seems to fall neatly into line with the Clinton campaign s negative fear-based campaign strategy.According to online searches, the Canadian site went down just after 10:30 pm ET on Tuesday evening followed by a surge in traffic, presumably for information on emigrating north of the border.Other key states have shocked pollsters and media  experts  in this election including strong Trump performances in Michigan, Ohio, Florida, North Carolina and Arizona.Stay up to date with all the results on the Business Insider live-blog here SEE ALSO: How to move to Canada and become a Canadian citizenREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"November 9, 2016",1
Trump EPA lags behind in environmental enforcement: report,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - During the first six months of the Trump presidency, the Environmental Protection Agency has lagged behind three previous administrations in environmental enforcement, collecting 60 percent less in civil penalties from polluters, a report released on Thursday said. During President Donald Trump’s first six months in office, the Justice Department collected $12 million in civil penalties as part of 26 civil lawsuits. That compares to $36 million in 34 cases during the Obama administration; $30 million in 31 cases under the George W. Bush administration; and $25 million in 45 cases during the Clinton administration’s first six months, the report by the Environmental Integrity Project (EIP) found. “If this drop-off in environmental enforcement continues, it will leave more people breathing more air pollution or swimming in waterways with more waste,” said EIP Executive Director Eric Schaeffer, who served as the EPA’s head of civil enforcement from 1997 to 2002. The report analyzed consent decrees lodged by the Justice Department from Trump’s first day in office, Jan. 21, through July 31, evaluating penalties paid by companies, the amount those companies will spend on pollution controls and how much pollution these enforcement actions can reduce. Patrick Traylor, deputy assistant administrator at EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, reviewed a copy of the report and said the findings were unfair because it can take months for a consent decree to be lodged. “This ‘snapshot’ ... says much more about enforcement actions commenced in the later years of the Obama administration than it does about actions taken in the beginning of the Trump administration,” he said in a statement. The report also found that value of injunctive relief, or the amount of money violators spend to install pollution controls and clean up, was also lowest in the Trump administration under EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. Under Trump, injunctive relief required in 10 cases totaled $197 million, compared to $710 million in 16 cases under Bush and $1.2 billion in 22 under Obama, the report said. EPA did not collect this data until the later years of the Clinton administration, so results could not be compared. Environmental groups have raised concerns about Pruitt’s close ties to the energy industry, documented in public records of his meetings. When asked about his approach to enforcement and close industry ties in an interview with Reuters last month, Pruitt said the EPA is committed to enforcement and working with states to carry it out.

Clinton begins Appalachia tour in Trump-friendly coal country,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton begins a two-day tour on Monday through rural, traditionally coal-reliant parts of the eastern Appalachian region where Republican rival Donald Trump’s pro-coal, anti-trade message has resonated with economically distressed voters.  Clinton, in a move to reclaim her early pledge to focus on helping the struggling region resuscitate its economies, will meet the head of a local steel workers union, retired mine workers and others in Kentucky, West Virginia and Ohio affected by declining coal and steel prices. Her pledge of more than $30 billion to help coal regions was overshadowed in March when Clinton, at an Ohio town hall, said the country would “put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” Clinton’s statement was seized upon by coal industry groups and Republican lawmakers such as U.S. Senators Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell, both from Kentucky, as evidence she planned to continue carrying out President Barack Obama’s regulatory “war” on coal. Clinton immediately sent an apology letter to Democratic U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, an early supporter, pledging to “focus my team and administration on bringing jobs to Appalachia” and help its residents adjust to a wave of coal company bankruptcies and changes in the U.S. energy market. Her decision to embark on an Appalachian tour is in part timed ahead of Democratic nominating contests in West Virginia on May 10 and in Kentucky on May 17 as she seeks to secure the nomination before the party’s July convention. Clinton won Ohio’s contest in mid-March, besting rival Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont. However, her aides say her decision to focus on the region also reflects her commitment to show voters she will work for them if elected, even if they do not support her now.  Clinton’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, campaigned on Sunday in West Virginia, encountering protests from Trump supporters and being asked about Clinton’s town hall remark and subsequent apology, according to local media reports. Manchin accompanied the former president, who is also expected to campaign in Kentucky on Tuesday. West Virginia last voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in 1996, when Bill Clinton was running for his second four-year term. He is the only Democrat who has won Kentucky since 1980. During her first presidential run, Clinton defeated Obama in the 2008 primaries in those states but lost the nomination to him. Her tour is an early move to siphon support from Trump, the front-runner for the Republican nomination, who has called for continued coal production and dismissed environmental concerns as a policy priority. Clinton’s first stop, at a restaurant in Ashland, Kentucky, will be a discussion with the leader of a local steel workers union and several of some 600 workers who were laid off when AK Steel Holding Corp announced in October that it would idle one of its furnaces amid a supply glut and lower steel prices. Clinton last month criticized China’s announcement that it was encouraging increased steel output amid a global surplus that is driving down prices and said, if elected, she would crack down on Chinese trade practices. She will continue to Williamson, West Virginia, a once-thriving town near the state’s border with Kentucky in Mingo County, the heart of the coal-producing region. Its main streets had been dotted with empty store fronts as coal mining employment has been cut in half over the past four years. The town is now trying to reshape its economy. Clinton will meet retired mine workers there and also tour the Williamson Health and Wellness Center, which serves as the nerve center for a local program that aims to drive economic revitalization through a health-focused, local-foods movement using land once designated for mining to drive large-scale agricultural development. Aides say Clinton’s interest in the region’s economic troubles was piqued after she left the U.S. State Department in 2013. She circulated data to aides then about studies related to decreased life expectancies for less-educated white adults in Appalachia, where the decline in coal-related employment has been accompanied by a growth in opioid addiction, diabetes and other health issues. Clinton has throughout her campaign criticized attempts made by coal companies to “shirk” the responsibility to pay healthcare benefits for retirees during bankruptcy proceedings, saying the country owes them gratitude for fueling decades of economic success.

 Trump Administration Is Already Talking About Withholding Harvey Aid,"On the National Day of Prayer, Donald Trump lashed out at South Korea and North Korea, while his administration wants Congress to attach aid for victims of Hurricane Harvey to a bill that would increase the federal debt limit. So, Trump is now at war with an influential group of House conservatives who have warned GOP leaders not to connect the two funding initiatives. This move might cause a looming conservative uprising. Usually, with Republicans, they want a debt limit increase tied to spending cuts but now, with an entire city underwater and thousands in shelters and at least 45 dead, Conservatives will have to battle it out.On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that he and the former reality show star believe that raising the U.S. debt limit, which Congress must do within the next few weeks in order to avoid defaulting on its bills, should be tied to disaster relief funding for Hurricane Harvey. Without raising the debt limit I m not comfortable that we d get the money we d need this month to Texas,  Mnuchin said on  Fox News Sunday. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin revealed the administration s approach Sunday morning when he was asked whether the White House could guarantee that funding for the disaster would not be attached to the fight over the debt ceiling. No, I can t. Quite the contrary,  Mnuchin said, adding,  The president and I believe that it should be tied to the Harvey funding.

Our first priority is to make sure that the state gets money, it is critical, and to do that we need to make sure we raise the debt limit,  he said.  Without raising the debt limit, I m not comfortable that we will get the money that we need this month to Texas to rebuild. In 2011, congressional Republicans brought the country to the brink of default after refusing to raise the debt ceiling unless Democrats agreed to a series of future spending cuts. And now, Conservatives and Republicans will have to slap fight each other in order to get aid to Texas.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"September 3, 2017",1

ARIZONA STATE UNIV DOUBLES TUITION… CLAIMS IT NEEDS MORE STATE FUNDS…Finds $500K To Donate To Clinton “Slush Fund”,"But what about that whole unfair  student debt  thing that Hillary and Bill are so concerned about?While Arizona State University has almost doubled its tuition over the past 10 years amid claims that it needs more state money, the school somehow had the funds to give half a million dollars to the Clinton Foundation.According to The Arizona Republic, the public university paid $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation to host the former president-Bill Clinton; former-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; and their daughter, Chelsea, during a Clinton Global Initiative University (CGI U) event in 2014. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Bill s wife, is the current front-runner for the Democratic nomination for the 2016 presidential race.Mark Johnson, an ASU spokesman, told The Republic that the university was a payment for the event not a contribution to the Clintons. ASU played host to the CGI University in March 2014, which featured former President Bill Clinton and former secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a program aimed at bringing together college students to find practical, innovative solutions to global challenges,  Johnson told the newspaper.  The report you cited reflects the fact that the university co-invested in this educational and promotional opportunity, which was co-produced for our students, and for students from around the world. No state funds were used for this purpose. The Republic also reported that while the university has lobbied the State Department, university officials claim the lobbying occurred after Hillary stepped down from the position.The CGI U website also boasts that more than 1,100 students attended the event to raise $60,000 and participate in a  Day of Action  in the community. Student attendees had the opportunity to attend plenary sessions, working sessions, and other special events covering topics across CGI U s five focus areas and allowing them to network with their peers, build skills, and identify potential partnerships,  the website for the event states.  Youth organizations, topic experts, and celebrities joined students at the CGI U meeting to help them gain the skills and knowledge needed to take action on their commitments. Earlier this month Arizona s Board of Regents voted to approve tuition increases for both undergraduate and graduate students at ASU, the University of Arizona, and Northern Arizona University. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) also recently approved a budget that cut more than $100 million from public universities, The Arizona State Press reported. In this regard ASU seems to hold themselves accountable to their own pet projects, as opposed to ASU students,  Richard Moorehead, a senior history major at ASU, told Campus Reform.  The money they wasted on the Clinton Foundation event could have been used for scholarships and genuine education. I realize bringing high-profile speakers can raise the profile of the university, but no speaker s time is worth $500,000, especially if that money is funneled into a presidential campaign,  Moorhead said. He did not attend the CGI U event.Ryan Hartwig, a recent ASU graduate, told Campus Reform that the $500,000 was  way too much for any celebrity or politician. It really makes me question what ASU does with their money, while they continue to complain about state budget cuts,  Hartwig said.The Washington Free Beacon reported that ASU has said it did not use state funds to pay the Clintons, but the university has not disclosed where the money actually came from.Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) participated in the event last year but told The Republic that had he known the price tag, it wouldn t have been worth it. Frankly, if I had known that that was the situation, that they were being paid $500,000, I would have spoken up at the time that I thought it was outrageous,  McCain said.Via: Campus Reform ",politics,"May 31, 2015",1
Trump travel ban back in U.S. courts next week as battles stretch on,"NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Legal challenges to President Donald Trump’s temporary travel ban on people from some Muslim-majority countries heat up again next week when two U.S. appeals courts consider whether it is constitutional. The legal fights may end up at the U.S. Supreme Court perhaps in the fall, many months after Trump first issued an executive order in January saying there was an urgent need to halt some immigration to the United States for 90 days while officials reviewed the visa process.          Trump dropped the original travel order after unfavorable legal rulings and replaced it with a more limited ban which is itself now being challenged in appeals courts on two coasts. Arguing that the United States needed to tighten national security measures, Trump’s attempt to limit travel was one of his first major acts in office. The fate of the ban is one indication of whether the Republican can carry out his promises to be tough on immigration and national security. Omar Jadwat, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, who will be arguing the case at the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia on Monday, said the fact that so much time has passed since the ban was issued is proof that there was no pressing national security need for it in the first place. The court fight will give those challenging the order an opportunity to argue that the government never intended for the travel pause to be temporary, said Buzz Frahn, an attorney at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett in Palo Alto, California whose firm has been closely tracking the ongoing litigation.  Now almost 100 days after the original travel ban, the government says the period of 90 days was reset when the administration issued the new order in March. The Department of Homeland Security “is, and will be, continuously examining ways to enhance the screening and vetting process to shut down terrorist and criminal pathways into the United States,” agency spokesman David Lapan said. “Some improvements will be classified, others will be public, but the Department has only just begun ways to enhance the security of our immigration system,” he said in an email. Opponents - including states and civil rights groups - say that both the first ban and the revised ban, which also put a halt to all refugee admissions to the country for four months, discriminates against Muslims.  The government argues the text of the order does not mention any specific religion and is needed to protect the country against attacks.      The 4th Circuit will decide the fate of a ruling from a Maryland district judge that struck down a section of the revised executive order barring visitors from Syria, Iran, Libya, Sudan, Yemen and Somalia.  The hearing will take place before 14 full-time judges of the appellate court. Ten of them were appointed by Democrats, and four by Republicans.  Then, on March 15, a three-judge panel at the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will review a decision from a Hawaii judge that halted not just the travel portion of the ban but also the section that barred refugees. The judges – who will sit on a panel in Seattle - have been assigned but their identities have not been made public. The 9th Circuit blocked Trump’s first ban in February, in a unanimous vote by one Republican-appointed judge and two-Democratic appointees. Trump lashed out at the ruling on Twitter and said he is ready for a fight at the Supreme Court. The nation’s highest court is more likely to hear a case if the federal appeals courts reach opposite rulings or if the issue is of great national importance, according to legal experts.       But the Supreme Court’s session ends in June, and if it take the case it would probably not be heard until after the justices return in October.  ",politicsNews,"May 5, 2017 ",0
 Legendary Humorist And Radio Host HAMMERS Trump In Devastating Open Letter,"Minnesota humorist Garrison Keillor just nailed Donald Trump in one of the best take-downs yet.Donald Trump is an insecure little man who thinks the presidency will finally make people respect him, and nobody made that clearer than Keillor, who wrote a column published on Wednesday that puts the Republican nominee in his place.Keillor begins by focusing on Trump s hat. The brim shadows your face, which gives a sinister look, as if you d come to town to announce the closing of the pulp factory,  he wrote.  Your eyes look dead and your scowl does not suggest American greatness so much as American indigestion. Keillor continued by pointing out that Trump has apparently been trying for his entire life to be liked and respected by the Manhattan elite.  The New York Times treats you like the village idiot,  Keillor wrote.  This is painful for a Queens boy trying to win respect in Manhattan When you came to Manhattan 40 years ago, you discovered that in entertainment, the press, politics, finance, everywhere you went, you ran into Jews, and they are not like you: Jews didn t go in for big yachts and a fleet of aircraft   they showed off by way of philanthropy or by raising brilliant offspring. They sympathized with the civil rights movement. In Queens, blacks were a threat to property values   they belonged in the Bronx, not down the street. To the Times, Queens is Cleveland. Bush league. You are Queens. The casinos were totally Queens, the gold faucets in your triplex, the bragging, the insults, but you wanted to be liked by Those People. This explains why Trump would throw his hat into the presidential ring. He is desperate for respect from his wealthy peers. Running for president is your last bid for the respect of Manhattan,  Keillor continued. If you were to win election, they couldn t ridicule you anymore. They could be horrified, but there is nothing ridiculous about being Leader of the Free World. You have B-52 bombers at your command. When you go places, a battalion of security guys comb the environs. You attract really really good speechwriters who give you Churchillian cadences and toss in quotes from Emerson and Aeschylus and Ecclesiastes. Keillor then went on to mock Trump over the bad month he had in August. The teleprompter is not your friend. You are in the old tradition of locker room ranting and big honkers in the steam room, sitting naked, talking man talk, griping about the goons and ginks and lousy workmanship and the uppity broads and the great lays and how you vanquished your enemies at the bank. Keillor concludes by pointing out that running for president is the hardest work Trump has ever done in his life and breaks the news to Donald that in the end he is going to lose and he won t get a damn thing he wanted. It s the hardest work you ve ever done. You walk out in the white cap and you rant for an hour about stuff that means nothing and the fans scream and wave their signs and you wish you could level with them for once and say one true thing: I love you to death and when this is over I will have nothing that I want. Donald Trump is currently imploding in the polls and his campaign continues fly off the rails even as he insists that he is winning and that everybody loves him.This is a man in serious denial and Keillor just hit him with the reality that he has always been a loser and will always be a loser.Featured image via Getty",News,"September 2, 2016",1
CHEVY CHASE ADMITS To Using Position At SNL To Push Democrats Over Republicans To Millions Of Viewers,"Comedian Mark Dice explores the influence so-called comedians have on their viewers when it comes to pushing their political views on fans. As part of his example, Dice shows his viewers a clip from a 1980 interview with leftist comedian Chevy Chase. Chase is not only unapologetic for using his position as a writer for SNL to push his liberal propaganda down the throats of unsuspecting viewers, he s actually quite arrogant about the power he believed he had over his fans on SNL.In the 1980 interview with CNN, Chevy Chase admits to using his position to affect the outcomes of the Gerald Ford   Jimmy Carter election. Chase admits to wanting to take down Gerald Ford and to promote Jimmy Carter:  I just went after him [Ford]. And uh I certainly, and obviously my leanings were Democratic and I wanted Carter in and I wanted him out. And I figured look, we re reaching millions of people uh..every weekend, so why not do it? The CNN reporter seems stunned by Chase s admission asks,  Wait a minute! You mean to tell me that in the back of your mind you were thinking,  Hey I want Carter and I m gonna make him [Ford] look bad? Chase, who seemed very pleased with his arrogant self bragged,  Oh yeah!

"Asked to explain 'calm before the storm' remark, Trump talks North Korea","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday appeared to confirm he had North Korea in mind last week when he described a gathering of military leaders as  the calm before the storm.  In an interview with U.S. network Fox News, Trump was asked what he meant with the cryptic phrase, which had fueled concerns the United States and North Korea were closer to war.  We can t let this to go on. We just can t,  Trump said in response to the question, adding that China has been very helpful in the situation.  They cut off banking to North Korea.  Trump made the  calm before the storm  comment during an Oct 5 photo opportunity before having dinner with U.S. military leaders and their wives. The dinner followed a meeting in which Trump and the military leaders discussed Iran, North Korea, Afghanistan and the fight against Islamic State.  On Wednesday, Trump also characterized a diplomatic deal with North Korea brokered under former President Bill Clinton as a failure.  Before ... the ink was dry on the contract, they were already starting again with the missiles, and with the nuclear, frankly,  Trump said.  We cannot allow this to happen. This should have been taken care of long ago.  he said.  ",worldnews,"October 12, 2017 ",0
Parents Outraged Over NC Teacher Forcing White and Christian Students to Stand Up in Class and Apologize for their ‘Privilege’,"Public uproar was at an all-time high at a North Carolina school board meeting (SEE VIDEO BELOW) over far-left  equity training  (SEE MORE BELOW ON EQUITY TRAINING) for government-school teachers. Allegations were made by furious parents that a teacher forced white and Christian students to stand up in class and apologize for their  privilege. IS THIS HAPPENING IN YOUR CHILD S SCHOOL?  EQUITY TRAINING  IS A NEW THING (SEE BELOW). THIS HAPPENED IN MAY AND THE TEACHER WAS FINALLY FIRED. WITH SCHOOL STARTING THIS FALL, PLEASE BE AWARE OF WHAT S GOING ON IN YOUR CHILD S CLASSROOM:A black English teacher, identified as Tarsha Clarke, made white students in her class stand up and apologize to non-white students for their  white privilege.  At a Rockingham School District meeting, a couple of parents stood up and voiced their outrage over the incident and also the fact that the school s administration was trying to sweep it all under the rug.WHY S THE MONEY GOING TO THIS WHEN THE DISTRICT IS BROKE?ON A SIDE NOTE: Rockingham County Schools is paying OpenSource Strategic Consulting a flat fee of $45,000 and will reimburse up to $1,500 for travel expenses over the course of the training. Rockingham County commissioners recently cut the county s education allotment by $269,000. The district faces around a $5.7 million shortfall, the report said.TWO OUTRAGED PARENTS SPOKE: The second parent is nowhere near as calm as the first parent in the clip  below. The first outraged parent who spoke was Farren Wilkinson:TRANSCRIPT OF FARREN WILKINSON S COMMENTS: Hello, my name is Farren Wilkinson   I just want to shed light on a situation that happened at Western Rockingham Middle School. Where a teacher caused some of her students to stand up and apologize to other students base on their inequal opportunities of education. So I would like to know how our schools can allow an educator to humiliate bully and degrade children. This is not a matter of race but a matter of a teacher using fear and the embarrassment of children to satisfy her own personal anger or beliefs. These children are not responsible nor accountable for any inequalities that are believed to be present,  Wilkinson said. The actions of this educator does not provide safe, nurtureing, dynamic and integrative learning. If she is not held to the standards set by Rockingham County schools, how can we expect other children to learn and grow to be productive citizens in society,  Wilkinson continued,  If nothing happens, if she s not repremanded, for these actions, and when the parents call to ask what has been done. They are being assured that this was taken care of. But how was it taken care of? What did happen? What was her training? What was her consequences for this action? Because again, these children are not responsible for any inequalities that may exist in the school system nor should they be publicly humiliated among their peers for her own satisfaction.After Wilkinson s testimony, another parent, Robert Jeremy, who said he had a 9-year-old son, expressed outrage to the school board because of the racism, bigotry, and hate expressed by the teacher against the young child based on his  race,  Christian views, and heterosexuality.TRANSCRIPT OF ROBERT JEREMY S COMMENTS: Hello, my name is Robert Jeremy,  he said.  Common sense, when did it become a good idea to attack a child at a school because they were white, or they were black, or they were straight, or they were Christian? Or because they believed in something moral that they were taught at home? You see I teach my child and my two older daughters family values, Christian values. I teach not to judge somebody by the color of their skin but by the color of their heart. And my child will not be insulted, reprimanded, corrected because he has a good moral fiber. MS CLARKE WAS FIRED FOR THIS DISGUSTING BEHAVIOR. ARE YOUR KIDS EXPERIENCING THIS?WHAT IS EQUITY TRAINING? Equity Training  is a new training and has been pushed on the teachers as a mandatory training done on their own time!Here s more from Greenboro.com The reason I know about the equity training is a group of teachers came to us because they felt like they needed help,  said Rockingham County GOP Chair Diane Parnell.  This equity training that was mandated upon them that they got no credit hours for and they must sit through this on their own time was something against their Christian principles, and if you take a look at it as I did, those equity training videos, it did seem to be against their principles. Speakers took issue with the training video s stance on topics like white privilege and transgender issues.THERE IS A RACIAL EQUALITY INSTITUTE!",left-news,"Sep 3, 2017",1

 The GOP Didn’t Waste Any Time Going Back To Hating Gay People With What They Just Did,"Only days after the worst mass shooting in the nation s history happened against the LGBT community, the GOP decided they could go back to being discriminatory.One would think they d wait at least a week, but apparently three days seemed long enough to mourn the loss of those who perished at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, because according to Vanity Fair:Republican leaders in the House of Representatives blocked a vote on a proposal that would ensure federal contractors can t discriminate against employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identification.That s right, you read that correctly, they seem to think it s perfectly acceptable for federal contractors to be able to fire someone for being gay.According to The Hill:Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.), who is gay, filed an amendment to a Defense Department spending bill that would enforce a 2014 executive order prohibiting discrimination against LGBT people.Yet, the House Rules Committee didn t see it worthy of consideration and wouldn t even allow it to be voted upon. Nope, not even a vote. Not even a chance.Apparently, the House GOP doesn t want anything added to the annual spending bills for fear that it may inhibit passage. You know, because adding non-discriminatory amendments for LGBT people in a House of Representatives full of GOP bigots doesn t go over well and could clog up business as usual.As The Hill explains:House GOP leaders decided to clamp down on amendments to annual spending bills after Maloney s proposal threatened passage of other appropriations measures last month. Before now, Republicans had been considering appropriations bills under a procedure allowing members of either party to offer unlimited amendments.Don t you see, they only want to play by their rules. If you re not doing something they like, well, then they will make sure it never happens, but guaranteed if it was the other way around, the story would be verrrry different.This just proves, yet again, that Republicans only care about themselves.Featured Photo by Allison Shelley/Getty Images",News,"June 15, 2016",1

Trump's $250 billion China 'miracle' adds gloss to 'off-kilter' trade,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - President Donald Trump can return to the United States claiming to have snagged over $250 billion in deals from his maiden trip to Beijing. Whether those deals live up to the lofty price tag is another question altogether. Watched by Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping at a signing ceremony in Beijing, U.S. planemaker Boeing Co, General Electric Co and chip giant Qualcomm Inc sealed lucrative multi-billion dollar deals. “This is truly a miracle,” China’s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said at a briefing in Beijing. The quarter of a trillion dollar haul underscores how Trump is keen to be seen to address a trade deficit with the world’s second-largest economy that he has long railed against and called “shockingly high” on Thursday. But U.S. businesses still have many long-standing concerns to complain about, including unfettered access to the China market, cybersecurity and the growing presence of China’s ruling Communist Party inside foreign firms. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said the deals pointed to “a strong, vibrant bilateral economic relationship” between the two countries. “Yet we still need to focus on leveling the playing field, because U.S. companies continue to be disadvantaged doing business in China.” U.S. tech companies like Facebook Inc and Google are mostly blocked in China. Automakers Ford Motor Co and General Motors must operate through joint ventures, while Hollywood movies face a strict quota system. “(These deals) allow Trump to portray himself as a master dealmaker, while distracting from a lack of progress on structural reforms to the bilateral trade relationship,” Hugo Brennan, Asia analyst at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, said in a note. Some huge deals were announced. Among them is a 20-year $83.7 billion investment by China Energy Investment Corp in shale gas developments and chemical manufacturing projects in West Virginia, a major energy producing state that voted heavily for Trump in the 2016 election. [ “The massive size of this energy undertaking and level of collaboration between our two countries is unprecedented,” West Virginia Secretary of Commerce H. Wood Thrasher said in a statement. It marks the first major overseas investment for the newly founded China Energy, which formed from the merger of China Shenhua Group, the country’s largest coal producer and China Guodian Corp, one of China’s top five utilities. However, as is often the case during state visits, many of the deals were packaged as “non-binding” agreements, gave scant details or rolled over existing tie-ups, helping pump up the headline figure. “I am somewhat skeptical of such a large number,” Alex Wolf, senior emerging markets economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum, adding that the overall tone of the visit so far had been “positive”. “I suspect they might be primarily MOUs (memorandum of understandings) instead of actual contracts and the actual contract amount may be substantially less.” Qualcomm signed non-binding agreements worth $12 billion with Xiaomi, OPPO and Vivo, three Chinese handset makers that the firm said it had “longstanding relationships” with. Qualcomm already earns more than half of its revenues in China. Boeing announced a deal with state-run China Aviation Suppliers Holding Co to sell 300 Boeing jets with a valuation of $37 billion at list prices, though analysts said it was unclear how many of these were new orders.  “Interesting to see how many of those are past agreements/purchase orders repackaged. Beijing is a master of selling the same agreement 10 times,” former Mexican ambassador to China Jorge Guajardo posted on Twitter. Speaking alongside Trump in Beijing as they announced the deals, Xi said the Chinese economy would become increasingly open and transparent to foreign firms, including those from the United States, and welcomed U.S. companies to participate in his ambitious “Belt and Road” infrastructure-led initiative. Trump made clear he blamed his predecessors, not China, for allowing the U.s. trade deficit to get “out of kilter”, and repeatedly praised Xi, calling him “a very special man”. “But we will make it fair and it will be tremendous for both of us,” Trump said.  Xi smiled widely when Trump said he does not blame China for the deficit. Asked whether the big package of deals would go some way towards helping fix American trade concerns in China, executives were cautiously optimistic. “Generally the sense was that this is all a good thing, and that’s great,” said Gentry Sayad, a Shanghai-based lawyer who attended the trade delegation event in Beijing.  “Now let’s see what really happens and whether or not the agreements signed during this trip can become a basis for a better bilateral trade relationship going forward.”  ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2017 ",0
Factbox: Trump fills top jobs for his administration,"(Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Monday he would name retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The following is a list of Republican Trump’s selections for top jobs in his administration. All the posts but that of national security adviser require Senate confirmation: Mattis is a retired Marine Corps general known for his tough talk, distrust of Iran and battlefield experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. A former leader of Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and South Asia, Mattis, 66, is known by many U.S. forces by his nickname “Mad Dog.” He was once rebuked for saying in 2005: “It’s fun to shoot some people.” Mnuchin, 53, is a relatively little-known but successful private equity investor, hedge fund manager and Hollywood financier who spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before leaving in 2002. He assembled an investor group to buy a failed California mortgage lender in 2009, rebranded it as OneWest Bank and built it into Southern California’s largest bank. The bank came under fire for its foreclosure practices as housing advocacy groups accused it of being too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. Ross, 78, heads the private equity firm W.L. Ross & Co. His net worth was pegged by Forbes at about $2.9 billion. A staunch supporter of Trump and an economic adviser, Ross has helped shape the Trump campaign’s views on trade policy. He blames the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, which entered into force in 1994, and the 2001 entry of China into the World Trade Organization for causing massive U.S. factory job losses. Chao, 63, was labor secretary under President George W. Bush for eight years and the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position. Chao is a director at Ingersoll Rand, News Corp and Vulcan Materials Company. She is married to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY: U.S. REPRESENTATIVE TOM PRICE Price, 62, is an orthopedic surgeon who heads the House of Representatives’ Budget Committee. A representative from Georgia since 2005, Price has criticized Obamacare and has championed a plan of tax credits, expanded health savings accounts and lawsuit reforms to replace it. He is opposed to abortion. U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: GOVERNOR NIKKI HALEY Haley, a 44-year-old Republican, has been governor of South Carolina since 2011 and has little experience in foreign policy or the federal government. The daughter of Indian immigrants, Haley led a successful push last year to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the South Carolina state capitol after the killing of nine black churchgoers in Charleston by a white gunman. DeVos, 58, is a billionaire Republican donor, a former chair of the Michigan Republican Party and an advocate for the privatization of education. As chair of the American Federation for Children, she has pushed at the state level for vouchers that families can use to send their children to private schools and for the expansion of charter schools.  Sessions, 69, was the first U.S. senator to endorse Trump’s presidential bid and has been a close ally since. The son of a country-store owner, the senator from Alabama and former federal prosecutor has long taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, opposing any path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.  Carson, 65, is a retired neurosurgeon who dropped out of the Republican presidential nominating race in March and threw his support to Trump. A popular writer and speaker in conservative circles, Carson previously indicated reluctance to take a position in the incoming administration because of his lack of experience in the federal government. Carson is the first African-American picked for a Cabinet spot by Trump. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: RETIRED LIEUTENANT GENERAL MICHAEL FLYNN Flynn, 57, was an early supporter of Trump and serves as vice chairman on his transition team. He began his U.S. Army career in 1981 and served deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq. Flynn became head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2012 under President Barack Obama, but retired a year earlier than expected, according to media reports, and became a fierce critic of Obama’s foreign policy. Pompeo, 52, is a third-term congressman from Kansas who serves on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, which oversees the CIA, National Security Agency and cyber security. A retired Army officer and Harvard Law School graduate, Pompeo supports the U.S. government’s sweeping collection of Americans’ communications data and wants to scrap the nuclear deal with Iran.

Pay Off: The Establishment Rewards Comey with $2 million Book Deal,"21st Century Wire says For his role in helping to sow chaos in the US political system and for promulgating the official conspiracy theory that Russia somehow  hacked  the US electoral process helping Donald Trump to win last November, and also ensuring that no charges were brought anywhere near the Clintons   former FBI Director James Comey has just received the first of many gifts from the Establishment.James Comey is no stranger to elite circles, and is clearly regarded by those at the top as  a safe pair of hands. As 21WIRE reported last year, James Comey served on the board of banking giant HSBC   the same bank that was convicted of international drugs and terrorism money laundering, as well as a bank which was closely linked to the corrupt Clinton Foundation. After working fellow lawyers Eric Holder and Lorretta Lynch to stage manage the public fall out from revelations about HSBC s epic criminal enterprise, and their subsequent slap on the wrist, Comey was then rewarded by President Obama when he was appointed head of the FBI in 2013.By anyone s measure, Comey was central to the mess which has resulted from the political circus surrounding the establishment s efforts to derail the Trump campaign, and  now through the Trump presidency.Congratulations. You got your book deal. You ve made it James AP/The GuardianThe former FBI director James Comey has signed a $2m ( 1.5m) deal for a book about leadership and decision-making that will draw on his career in government, which included the high-profile drama leading up to his sacking from Donald Trump s administration.According to the publisher, Comey will tell how he handled the bureau s probe into Hillary Clinton s private email server and the allegations of ties between Russia and Trump s presidential campaign.Trump sacked Comey as FBI chief in May, later telling NBC News that he was angered by the FBI s investigation into  this Russia thing , which he insists is a fake story. Comey has since testified before Congress that Trump asked him to end an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael T Flynn and kept memos about his meetings with the president.The book was acquired by Flatiron, an Macmillan imprint, which promises that Comey will cite  examples from some of the highest-stakes situations in the past two decades of US government . It will also  share yet unheard anecdotes from his long and distinguished career .The book is currently untitled and scheduled for publication next spring. Throughout his career, James Comey has had to face one difficult decision after another, as he has served the leaders of our country,  Flatiron said in a statement.  His book promises to take us inside those extraordinary moments in our history, showing us how these leaders have behaved under pressure. By doing so, Director Comey will give us unprecedented entry into the corridors of power, and a remarkable lesson in leadership itself.

Argentines march to demand answers on case of missing activist,"Buenos Aires (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Argentines marched through the rain in front of the presidential palace on Sunday to demand answers in the case of a young protester who went missing two months ago. Opposition and human rights groups believe state security forces took Santiago Maldonado, a 28-year-old craftsman, and allege President Mauricio Macri s government is covering up information on his whereabouts. Maldonado was last seen during an Aug. 1 operation by the National Gendarmerie to end a land occupation in Chubut province by the indigenous Mapuche.  My intuition tells me the Gendarmerie have him. Where, I don t know,  Maldonado s brother, Sergio Maldonado, told reporters at the rally in downtown Buenos Aires. Protesters marched carrying images of Maldonado s bearded face and signs that read  may he appear alive now.

Rights groups say up to 30,000 people  disappeared.  Macri s government has said that there is no evidence that shows security forces detained Maldonado. ",worldnews,"October 1, 2017 ",0

Tunisia's new government gets party backing for reform push,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia s two main parties on Thursday gave parliamentary backing to Prime Minister Youssef Chahed s new cabinet, handing him the initiative to push sensitive economic reforms demanded by the International Monetary Fund. Chahed s cabinet needs strong support to reform public sector wages and overhaul the pension system to improve national finances. Infighting and social protests have kept past governments from pushing through tougher austerity reforms. Chahed on Wednesday named 13 new ministers including heads of the interior, defense and finance ministries. He appointed Taoufik Rajhi, one of his advisors from the Islamist Ennahda party, to a new economic reforms ministry in a deal that ends weeks of party infighting over posts. Rached Ghannouchi, the head of Ennahda party, called his 69 lawmakers in parliament to give a vote of confidence to the coalition government which includes ruling Nidaa Tounes, Machroua Tounes, the Republican and Massar parties.  The new cabinet also includes independents and former ministers who worked with ex-President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, ousted by a popular uprising in 2011. Ennahda won four important ministries, including the new ministry of economic reforms. Nidaa Tounes led by the son of President Beji Caid Essesbi welcomed the reshuffle in which his party secured six new posts and other junior portfolios.  This reshuffle maintained political balances, boosted the political weight of our party, we will give our confidence to the new team,  Sofian Tobal an official in Nidaa Tounes said. Backing from the two main parties means Chahed s government can expect support from at least 150 lawmakers in the 217-seat parliament. Ennahda and Nidaa Tounes have more than 130 seats between them plus the support of smaller parties. Chahed s cabinet needs 109 votes to win a confidence ballot.  This government would be like a war cabinet, in a war against the corruption, against rampant unemployment and a war to save the economy,  Chahed said on Wednesday. He has said he will present parliament with a comprehensive plan to push the economy forward, including accelerating the coordination of public-private partnerships and proposing more incentives to investors.  We will confront the imbalance in public finances, adjust the trade balance and improve the situation of public institutions that are facing difficulties, as well progress on major priority reforms,  he said. Tunisia is struggling to revive its economy and create jobs for frustrated youth. But it is under pressure to reduce deficits by stopping public sector hiring, laying off thousands of state employees and selling shares in some troubled public institutions. Reforms are also expected to include cuts in subsidies for energy and some basic materials, which would be highly sensitive and rejected by Tunisia strong unions who have in the past played the role of political power brokers.

Qatar flexes financial muscle with 12 billion euros of French deals,"DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar will buy fighter jets and armored vehicles as part of 12 billion euros worth of commercial contracts it agreed with France on Thursday, bolstering its military capability and its international ties as it faces a boycott by other Arab states. The latest contracts underscored how Doha can use the wealth it has accumulated as the world s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas to defy some of the largest and wealthiest Arab countries. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and trade relations with the emirate almost six months ago. They accuse the Qataris of backing terrorism, which Qatar denies.  Our position on this blockade was very clear. Qatar s position was very clear - to resolve this problem, if we saw problems between us and our neighbors - we should be at a table and speak honestly,  Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani said at a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron, who has tried to play a mediation role between the sides, was in Doha to discuss how to combat the financing of terrorism at a time when the Middle East is locked in a regional power struggle between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran.  Restoring stability to the Gulf is a priority for us because we have a lot of friends here,  Macron said.  Our wish is that we find a quick resolution to today s situation.  Paris has strong commercial and political ties with Qatar. It has promoted deeper business interests in the country and encouraged Qatari investment in France, where the Gulf state already has assets of about $10 billion. Macron said some 12 billion euros ($14.13 billion) worth of deals were agreed on Thursday. They included Qatar s taking up an option from 2015 to buy 12 more Dassault Aviation-made Rafale fighters, and saying it could purchase a further 36. It has already bought 24 planes for about 6 billion euros, including missiles. It also committed to buying 490 armored vehicles from defense firm Nexter.  Doha has repeatedly called for dialogue with its neighbors, although it has strengthened its military as relations with them have deteriorated. It has secured this year alone military equipment deals with the United States, Russia and Britain.   In total, it amounts to nearly 12 billion euros which was signed today and which underlines the closeness of our economic cooperation,  Macron said. Among other deals signed, Suez SEVI.PA will dredge and clean Qatar s lagoon and a rail consortium of RATP and SNCF will build and operate a metro system in the Qatari capital. Qatar Airways also placed a new order for Airbus A321neo civilian aircraft to replace an earlier A320neo order. The new deal for larger planes is worth an extra $930 million at current list prices for Airbus and involves a switch of engine supplier to a French-American venture co-owned by Safran (SAF.PA)< and General Electric (GE.N).

Nancy Hatch Dupree 'Grandmother of Afghanistan' dies in Kabul,"KABUL (Reuters) - Nancy Hatch Dupree, a historian from the United States who helped set up the Afghanistan Centre at Kabul University, has died in the country whose culture she worked for more than five decades to preserve, the university said on Sunday. She was 89. Dupree arrived in Kabul in 1962 as a diplomat s wife but soon divorced and married Louis Dupree, an archaeologist celebrated for his adventurous exploits and groundbreaking discoveries of Paleolithic Afghan tools and artifacts. For the next 15 years, they traveled across Afghanistan by Land Rover as Louis Dupree excavated prehistoric sites and Nancy wrote a series of witty and insightful guidebooks to a country since torn apart by decades of warfare.  She called herself an old monument and a lot of Afghans called her the  Grandmother of Afghanistan,  said Wahid Wafa, Executive Director of the Afghanistan Centre.  She understood and knew Afghanistan much better than anybody else.  A fixture in the social scene of Kabul during the 1970s, a now-vanished world of smart cocktail parties and mini-dresses, they were forced to leave in 1978 after the Soviet-backed government accused Louis Dupree of being a spy. Her husband died in 1989 and much of the time before her return to Afghanistan in 2005 was spent in Pakistan, where as well as briefly meeting Osama Bin Laden and working with the growing number of war refugees, she assiduously gathered as much documentation on Afghanistan as she could. In 2005, after the fall of the Taliban and the installation of a new Western-backed government in Kabul, she returned with some 35,000 documents wrapped up in fertilizer bags, which became the basis for the Afghanistan Centre archive. A prolific writer, she was director of the Centre between 2006 and 2011 and continued to go into her office after she stepped down, remaining an institution in the cultural life of Kabul and receiving a stream of visitors.    It was Nancy s aim to preserve Afghanistan s heritage,  said Wafa.  She was a very funny, interesting person who loved to talk to anyone coming to visit. She was kind, she was very giving with the information she had and she was always lobbying for the Afghanistan she first knew.  While she could be waspishly critical of both blundering Westerners and Afghans she felt were promoting a bigoted version of their culture, she retained her faith in her adopted country to the end, Wafa said.   Despite the 40 years of war in Afghanistan she was always hopeful of the future and hopeful for the future of the new generation in Afghanistan.  ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",0
DIGITAL TYRANNY: Google and Facebook’s Automated Censorship Program (I Hope You Can Speak Chinese),"21st Century Wire says Based on their own reports and public statements, it was clear that both Google and Facebook, and others, were engaged in formulating a wide program of censorship in order to  tackle  what the corporations deem as  offensive speech  or  hate speech . Although based on the political biases of members of these corporations, the actual administration of this will be done by fully hidden and unaccountable automated computer algorithms. According to new reports, the new methods are not merely the manipulation of metrics used to downplay content. These are incredibly clandestine and very sinister measures: without visibly shutting down an account, this new automated censorship process will simply make an account holder s posts invisible to their friends, fans and followers, in what Google/YouTube is calling  a limited state  in order to  isolate and contain  a targeted user   even if they have NOT violated the user terms of services. This is designed not only to  disappear  important opinions and information   but also to frustrate users, in the hopes that they will eventually abandon the platform as a viable content distribution network.We believe that Facebook may also be implementing similar restrictions on political speech. Mark Zuckerberg s admission to Angela Merkel that Facebook was working on eliminating  hate speech  was an early indicator, and undoubtedly the election of Donald Trump, and the subsequent scapegoating of  fake news  by Clinton supporters, has since pushed many  progressive  Silicon Valley executives over the edge. However, things may have advanced considerably since then. On August 5th, 21stCenturyWire.com Editor Patrick Henningsen had his personal Facebook newsfeed for 21WIRE articles  disappeared : UPDATE: Sunday afternoon GMT, it seems that the invisible admins at Facebook has (quietly) re-opened his profile s newsfeed which seems to be visible to some of my friends now, although yesterday s posts are still HIDDEN (you can see them by scrolling down his timeline). They did not respond to Henningsen s written complaint via customer service however   no surprise there, as they never have done before. The important aspect to focus on here is that these secretive measures are all part of a wider political agenda. With Silicon Valley corporations clearly determined to preside over an all-encompassing social media monopoly, such restrictive politicized policies become even more dangerous. The following story which broke yesterday details an apparent backlash from a Google employee against the company s  diversity policies  has gone internally viral at the company. This was reportedly filed by VICE magazine s tech section, Motherboard: The person who wrote the document argued that the representation gap between men and women in software engineering persists because of biological differences between the two sexes, according to public tweets from Google employees. It also said Google should not offer programs for underrepresented racial or gender minorities, according to one of the employees I spoke to. The 10-page Google Doc document was met with derision from a large majority of employees who saw and denounced its contents, according to the employee. But Jaana Dogan, a software engineer at Google, tweeted that some people at the company at least partially agreed with the author; one of our sources said the same. While the document itself contains the thoughts of just one Google employee, the context in which they were shared Google is currently being investigated by the Department of Labor for its gender pay gap and Silicon Valley has been repeatedly exposed as a place that discriminates against women and people of color as well as the private and public response from its workforce are important. See Gizmodo s review of the 10 page Google Doc.Listen to this incredible analysis by Mister Metokur exposing the highly unethical, discriminatory, collusive   and ultimately illegal practices which are being implemented by Google, Facebook, Twitter and other social media cartel platforms in order to erase political speech which they seek to suppress: SUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV",US_News,"August 6, 2017",1

NEW EMAILS SHOW HILLARY Asking How Meeting On Libyan War Would Impact Hamptons Vacation…And MORE,"These grifters have no shame. How much more evidence do Americans need to see before they understand Hillary has no interest in our nation s security? How much more evidence do we need before the Everyday American Queen of the Clinton Crime Syndicate is sent to prison? Judicial Watch today released nearly 70 pages of State Department records that show that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides, Deputy Chiefs of Staff Huma Abedin and Jake Sullivan, received and sent classified information on their non-state.gov email accounts. The documents, also available on the State Department website, were obtained in response to a court order from a May 5, 2015, lawsuit filed against the State Department (Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:15-cv-00684)) after it failed to respond to a March 18 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request seeking:All emails of official State Department business received or sent by former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin from January 1, 2009 through February 1, 2013 using a non- state.gov  email address.The new documents show that Hillary Clinton used the clintonemail.com system to ask Huma Abedin (also on a non-state.gov email account) to print two March 2011 emails, which were sent from former British Prime Minister Tony Blair (using the moniker  aclb ) to Jake Sullivan on Sullivan s non-state.gov email account. The Obama State Department redacted the Blair emails under Exemption (b)(1) which allows the withholding of classified material. The material is marked as being classified as  Foreign government information  and  foreign relations or foreign activities of the US, including confidential sources. Another email shows that Clinton wanted to know how meetings in Washington, including a four-hour meeting concerning America s war on Libya, would impact her Hampton vacation. Responding to an email that details the sensitive meetings in DC, Clinton emails Abedin on August 26, 2011,  Ok. What time would I get back to Hamptons?  Again, this email discussion takes place on non-state.gov email accounts.The documents also include advice to Clinton on Libya from Sidney Blumenthal, a Clinton Foundation employee who, according to a Judicial Watch investigative report, also had business interests in Libya. Clinton wanted Blumenthal s March 9, 2011, Libya memo to be printed  without any identifiers. The newly released Abedin emails include a lengthy exchange giving precise details of Clinton s schedule using unsecured government emails. The email from Lona J. Valmoro, former Special Assistant to Secretary of State Clinton, to Abedin and Clinton reveals exact times (including driving times) and locations of all appointments throughout the day. Another itinerary email provides details about a meeting at the United Nations in New York at 3:00 on Tuesday, January 31, 2012, with the precise disclosure,  that would mean wheels up from Andrews at approximately 12:00pm/12:15pm. These emails show that Hillary Clinton isn t the only Obama official who should be worried about being prosecuted for mishandling classified information. Her former top State aides (and current campaign advisers) Huma Abedin and Jake Sullivan should be in the dock, as well,  said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.  The Obama State Department has now confirmed that Clinton, Abedin, and Sullivan used unsecured, non-government email accounts to communicate information that should now be withheld from the American people  in the interest of national defense or foreign policy, and properly classified.  When can we expect the indictments?  Via: Judicial Watch",left-news,"Feb 9, 2016",1

Bus bomb kills eight in Syria's Homs city: state media,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - A bomb blast killed eight people and injured 16 others on a bus in Syria s Homs on Tuesday, state media said, citing the city s health authority. Islamic State claimed the attack, saying the blast killed 11 members of the Syrian army, its official news agency AMAQ said. Many of the passengers were university students, Homs Governor Talal Barazi told state-run Ikhbariya TV. The blast in the government-held city hit the Akrama district, near al-Baath University.  Footage showed people crowding around the burned shell of a vehicle in the middle of a street. State television said  a bomb that terrorists planted in a passenger bus exploded .  Islamic State militants had claimed responsibility for a similar attack in Homs in May, when a car bomb killed four people and injured 32 others.  A string of bombings have struck cities under government control in Syria this year, including the capital Damascus.  The Tahrir al-Sham alliance   led by fighters formerly linked to al-Qaeda   has also claimed some of the deadly attacks.  Security agencies are constantly chasing sleeper cells,  the Homs police chief said on Ikhbariya.  Today, it could be a sleeper cell or it could be an infiltration.  Barazi, the governor, said the state s enemies were trying to target stability as  the stage of victory  drew near.  The city of Homs returned to full government control in May for the first time since the onset of Syria s conflict more than six years ago. With the help of Russian jets and Iran-backed militias, the Damascus government has pushed back rebel factions in western Syria, shoring up its rule over the main urban centers. The army and allied forces then marched eastwards against Islamic State militants this year. The United States has voiced concern about Syrian and Russian attacks. The U.S. State Department on Tuesday strongly condemned attacks this week on eastern Ghouta believed to have been carried out by Syrian and Russian jets. The jets struck crowded residential areas in the besieged rebel enclave near Damascus on Sunday, killing at least 27 people, aid workers and a war monitor said.   Deliberate tactics to starve Syrian civilians, including women and children, block humanitarian and medical aid, bomb hospitals, medical personnel and first responders in eastern Ghouta, we consider that to be deeply troubling,  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said. She urged Russia to live up to its obligations to uphold the de-escalation zone in eastern Ghouta. ",worldnews,"December 5, 2017 ",0
SEC Chair White defies Republican requests to stall rulemaking,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White on Monday defied requests by Senate Republicans to delay adopting new rules on everything from derivatives to mutual funds until after President-elect Donald Trump takes office. In a letter to the Senate Banking Committee’s top two Republicans, Chairman Richard Shelby and Mike Crapo of Idaho, White stressed it was “incumbent” on the SEC to “exhibit a spirit of firm independence” in performing its regulatory duties “without fear or favor.”  White’s Dec. 12 letter, which was reviewed by Reuters, comes in response to a request last month by Shelby and Crapo for the SEC to cease adopting rules until after Trump had a chance to review the agency’s agenda.  Republicans in Congress have been pressing agencies across the federal government to wind down their rulemaking activities.    Trump has vowed to kill many regulations put on the books during the Obama administration, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.  White, an independent, is slated to step down from her post at the end of Democratic President Barack Obama’s term in January.  The Senate failed to confirm Obama’s two nominees for vacant commissioner slots at the SEC before it recessed last week, which means that after White departs next month, the SEC will only be left with two commissioners - one Democrat and one Republican.  Even before she leaves, she could still fail to get the rules passed if she cannot get a quorum of commissioners to agree. Trump has yet to announce a nominee for SEC chair, but many of the people working on his financial regulatory transition team, such as former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, have been highly critical of many of the SEC’s rules and Dodd-Frank more broadly. In White’s letter on Monday, she provided Shelby and Crapo with a list of all the rules currently ready for a vote.  Among the rules on the list are derivatives reforms mandated by Dodd-Frank, such as capital and margin requirements for swap dealers, as well as a more controversial one that would limit how mutual funds and exchange-traded funds use derivatives to leverage returns. The letter did not say when the SEC might vote on the rules. The agency could do it during an open meeting or behind closed doors. An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment on the timing. “I am not insensitive to the issues raised by your letter and have carefully considered what impact, if any, the election should have on the current work of the Commission,” White wrote. She added that she had confirmed that the SEC “historically has proceeded with its work during comparable post-election periods.”     In support of her position, White included footnotes in her letter citing prior statements by Republican SEC Commissioner Mike Piwowar, who is poised to become acting chair in January, in which he voiced support for completing new derivatives rules. This is not the first time the SEC has faced criticism on efforts to complete rules before a change in leadership at the regulator. In 2005, a federal appeals court sided with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in a dispute with the SEC over controversial rules requiring the majority of mutual fund board directors to be independent. The court sent the rule back to the SEC with a directive to consider its costs.  Then-SEC Chairman William Donaldson promptly scheduled a meeting and the SEC re-adopted it a day before his resignation, saying the rule would not be overly costly. The rule was subsequently overturned a second time, and the court chided the SEC for failing to follow proper rulemaking procedures. Even if White is successful in adopting final rules in the coming weeks, Congress may have a way to undo them when Trump takes office on Jan. 20. By law, Congress can vote to reverse regulations within 60 legislative days of them becoming final - which could be easier to accomplish under a Republican-controlled Congress and White House.
